Methods\u2014 For 41 patients with unilateral carotid stenosis \u226570%, CBF and cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) were investigated with resting and acetazolamide-challenge single photon emission CT before CEA. CBF 1 day after CEA was also measured. Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis of CBF changes was performed by use of a control database of 20 subjects. Results\u2014 Patients with reduced CVR (CVR <10%, n=15) were categorized into 2 groups based on the severity of CBF reduction relative to the control database by 3D-SSP analysis without normalization: type I (ipsilateral CBF decrease <20%, n=8) and type II (ipsilateral CBF decrease \u226520%, n=7). With thalamic normalization, the patients were also categorized into 2 groups: type A (ipsilateral Z score \u22642, n=10) and type B (ipsilateral Z score >2, n=5). Severe CBF reduction (\u226520% or Z score >2) was significantly associated with postoperative hyperperfusion (CBF increase \u2265100%). However, 3D-SSP with thalamic normalization (Z score) demonstrated a higher predictive value (80%) and specificity (91%) for hyperperfusion than 3D-SSP without normalization (percent reduction) (57% and 73%, respectively).

Mercury (Hg) is emitted to the atmosphere mainly as volatile elemental Hg0. Oxidation to water-soluble HgII plays a major role in Hg deposition to ecosystems. Here, we implement a new mechanism for atmospheric Hg0\u202f\u2215\u202fHgII redox chemistry in the GEOS-Chem global model and examine the implications for the global atmospheric Hg budget and deposition patterns. Our simulation includes a new coupling of GEOS-Chem to an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm), enabling a global 3-D representation of atmosphere\u2013ocean Hg0\u202f\u2215\u202fHgII cycling. We find that atomic bromine (Br) of marine organobromine origin is the main atmospheric Hg0 oxidant and that second-stage HgBr oxidation is mainly by the NO2 and HO2 radicals. The resulting chemical lifetime of tropospheric Hg0 against oxidation is 2.7\u00a0months, shorter than in previous models. Fast HgII atmospheric reduction must occur in order to match the \u2009\u223c\u2009\u202f6-month lifetime of Hg against deposition implied by the observed atmospheric variability of total gaseous mercury (TGM\u202f\u2009\u2261\u2009\u202fHg0\u202f+\u202fHgII(g)). We implement this reduction in GEOS-Chem as photolysis of aqueous-phase HgII\u2013organic complexes in aerosols and clouds, resulting in a TGM lifetime of 5.2\u00a0months against deposition and matching both mean observed TGM and its variability. Model sensitivity analysis shows that the interhemispheric gradient of TGM, previously used to infer a longer Hg lifetime against deposition, is misleading because Southern Hemisphere Hg mainly originates from oceanic emissions rather than transport from the Northern Hemisphere. The model reproduces the observed seasonal TGM variation at northern midlatitudes (maximum in February, minimum in September) driven by chemistry and oceanic evasion, but it does not reproduce the lack of seasonality observed at southern hemispheric marine sites. Aircraft observations in the lowermost stratosphere show a strong TGM\u2013ozone relationship indicative of fast Hg0 oxidation, but we show that this relationship provides only a weak test of Hg chemistry because it is also influenced by mixing. The model reproduces observed Hg wet deposition fluxes over North America, Europe, and China with little bias (0\u201330\u202f%). It reproduces qualitatively the observed maximum in US deposition around the Gulf of Mexico, reflecting a combination of deep convection and availability of NO2 and HO2 radicals for second-stage HgBr oxidation. However, the magnitude of this maximum is underestimated. The relatively low observed Hg wet deposition over rural China is attributed to fast HgII reduction in the presence of high organic aerosol concentrations. We find that 80\u202f% of HgII deposition is to the global oceans, reflecting the marine origin of Br and low concentrations of organic aerosols for HgII reduction. Most of that deposition takes place to the tropical oceans due to the availability of HO2 and NO2 for second-stage HgBr oxidation.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "859a4ddbbb22014f09b8787353529e20012a6bdb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2262066642", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.5b03548", "CorpusId": 206551042, "PubMed": "26545153"}, "title": "Ultra-Low Carbon Emissions from Coal-Fired Power Plants through Bio-Oil Co-Firing and Biochar Sequestration.", "abstract": "This study investigates a novel strategy of reducing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants through co-firing bio-oil and sequestering biochar in agricultural lands.

Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kWh electricity produced vary from 1.02 to 0.26 kg CO2-eq among different cases, with BCF heavy end fractions ranging from 10% to 60%, which corresponds to a GHG emissions reduction of 2.9% to 74.9% compared with that from traditional bituminous coal power plants.

China recently surpassed the United States as the largest greenhouse gas emitter, and its projected future emissions far outstrip those of any other nation. Although the United States has been the largest emitter for years, China's emissions have enabled critics in the United States to argue that domestic reductions will be ineffective and will transfer jobs to China. These two aspects of the China Problem, Chinese emissions and their influence on the political process in the United States, result in a mutually supportive but ultimately destructive dance between the two countries. This article argues that a post-Kyoto international agreement and other measures are necessary but will not create sufficient incentives to induce China, and ultimately the United States, to act. Instead, the article draws on the fact that the United States and Europe account for 41% of Chinese exports to propose a novel means of changing both countries' incentives. The article suggests that private or public schemes in the United States and Europe to disclose product carbon emissions and corporate carbon footprints can create consumer and other pressure that will induce firms to impose supply chain requirements on Chinese and other suppliers.

To reduce emissions, economies must reduce their carbon intensity; given current technology, this implies a decisive shift away from fossil-fuel energy and related physical capital. In an adverse scenario, the transition to a low-carbon economy occurs late and abruptly. Belated awareness about the importance of controlling emissions could result in an abrupt implementation of quantity constraints on the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. The costs of the transition will be correspondingly higher. This adverse scenario could affect systemic risk via three main channels. First, a sudden transition away from fossil-fuel energy could harm GDP, as alternative sources of energy would be restricted in supply and more expensive at the margin. Second, there could be a sudden repricing of carbon-intensive assets, which are financed in large part by debt. Third, there could be a concomitant rise in the incidence of natural catastrophes related to climate change, raising general insurers' and reinsurers' liabilities. To quantify the importance of these channels, policymakers could aim for enhanced disclosure of the carbon intensity of non-financial firms. The related exposures of financial firms could then be stress-tested under the adverse scenario of a late and sudden transition. In the short-term, joint research efforts of energy experts and macroeconomists could help to better quantify macroeconomic risks and inform the design of scenarios for stress testing. In the medium-term, the availability of granular data and dedicated low-frequency stress tests will provide information about the impact of the adverse scenario on the financial system.

Of this amount, one half to two thirds of the emissions may have been from the extremely long and ageing gas pipeline system.

The envelope of minimum and maximum estimates for emissions from the former Soviet Union ranges from 29 to 50 Tg of methane. The limited availability of systematic and accurate published information on the emissions introduces significant uncertainty into the estimate. In an attempt to constrain emissions better, estimates of losses from specific causes were made using two or more independent approaches, where possible. A reasonable agreement between estimates was achieved in those cases. Our results imply that substantial reductions in emissions could be achieved by investment to reduce losses.

EC-Earth simulates the twentieth century Arctic climate relatively well but the Arctic is about 2\u00a0K too cold and the sea ice thickness and extent are overestimated. In the twenty-first century, the results show a continuation and strengthening of the Arctic trends observed over the recent decades, which leads to a dramatically changed Arctic climate, especially in the high emission scenario RCP8.5. The annually averaged Arctic mean near-surface temperature increases by 12\u00a0K in RCP8.5, with largest warming in the Barents Sea region. The warming is most pronounced in winter and autumn and in the lower atmosphere. The Arctic winter temperature inversion is reduced in all scenarios and disappears in RCP8.5. The Arctic becomes ice free in September in all RCP8.5 simulations after a rapid reduction event without recovery around year 2060. Taking into account the overestimation of ice in the twentieth century, our model results indicate a likely ice-free Arctic in September around 2040. Sea ice reductions are most pronounced in the Barents Sea in all RCPs, which lead to the most dramatic changes in this region. Here, surface heat fluxes are strongly enhanced and the cloudiness is substantially decreased. The meridional heat flux into the Arctic is reduced in the atmosphere but increases in the ocean. This oceanic increase is dominated by an enhanced heat flux into the Barents Sea, which strongly contributes to the large sea ice reduction and surface-air warming in this region. Increased precipitation and river runoff lead to more freshwater input into the Arctic Ocean.

In subsequent work, it was found that applying a low compression ratio was effective in expanding the MK combustion region on the high-load side. The MK concept was then combined with an exhaust after-treatment system and applied to a test vehicle. The results indicated the attainment of ULEV emission levels, albeit in laboratory evaluations. In the present work, the combination of the MK combustion concept and certain fuel properties has been experimentally investigated with the aim of reducing exhaust emissions further. The results indicated that the use of a high cetane number gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel with a lower compression ratio provides a sufficiently long ignition delay to accomplish MK combustion. The effect on a simultaneous reduction of NOx and smoke was confirmed. The results also indicated that the use of GTL fuel can reduce the total hydrocarbon level substantially under a cold condition because of its good ignition characteristics, with a high cetane number and high levels of paraffin compounds.

This political distortion must be taken into account when designing future environmental regulation such as CO2 regulation. The three main interest groups in the U.S. (private business, environmentalist groups and the electricity sector) prefer a grandfathered permit market. Business is attracted by this solution because free initial distribution of permits both favours existing sources financially and, furthermore, creates a barrier to entry for new firms. Environmentalist groups have changed attitudes and promote the idea too as a way of negotiating higher target reduction levels with industry to maintain voluntary contributions from their members. Finally, electric utilities prefer a grandfathered permit market, and this step towards less planned economy may be explained by the rise of competition in the U.S. electricity sector. Therefore, it is suggested that a grandfathered permit market is a more effective policy than a tax in relation to organized interests such as industry, electric utilities and environmental organizations. In perspective, the grandfathered permit market may be mixed with the use of taxes. In the case of CO2 regulation, for example, taxes may be applied to badly organized polluters, such as households and the transport sector, because their lobbying power is weak.

We propose and apply a method for analyzing the net effect of CARS on greenhouse gas emissions from a full vehicle life cycle perspective, including the impact of premature production and retirement of vehicles. We find that CARS had a one-time effect of preventing 4.4 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, about 0.4% of US annual light-duty vehicle emissions. Of these, 3.7 million metric tons are avoided during the period of the expected remaining life of the inefficient \u2018clunkers\u2019. 1.5 million metric tons are avoided as consumers purchase vehicles that are more efficient than their next replacement vehicle would otherwise have been.

High coal seam permeability is required for efficient and practical sequestration of CO2 and H2S and recovery of CH4. However, adsorption of CO2 and H2S into coals induces strong swelling of the coal matrix (volumetric strain) and thus reduces significantly coal permeability by narrowing and even closing fracture apertures. Our experimental data on three western Canadian coals show that the adsorption-induced volumetric strain is approximately linearly proportional to the volume of adsorbed gas, and for the same gas, different coals have very similar volumetric strain coefficient. Impacts of adsorption-induced swelling on stress and permeability around wellbores were analytically investigated using our developed stress and permeability models. Our model results indicate that adsorption-induced volumetric strain has significant controls on stress and permeability of producing and sequestrating coal seams and consequently the potential of acid gas sequestration. Coal seams may undergo >10 times enhancement of permeability around CH4-producing wellbores due to a reduction in effective stress as a result of coal shrinking caused by methane desorption accompanying a reduction in reservoir pressure. Injection of H2S and CO2 on the other hand results in strong sorption-induced swelling and a marked increase in effective stress which in turn leads to a reduction of coal seam permeability of up to several orders of magnitude. Injection of mixtures of N2 and CO2 such as found in flue gas results in weaker swelling, the amount of which varies with gas composition, and provides the greatest opportunity of sequestering CO2 and secondary recovery of CH4 for most coals. Because of the marked swelling of coal in the presence of H2S, even minor amounts of H2S result in a marked reduction in permeability, and hence sequestration of H2S in deep coals will be likely impractical. Furthermore, high stresses resulting from sorption of acid gases will potentially cause the coal to yield, fracture or slip, and produce fine particles, which further affect permeability and thus methane production and acid gas sequestration.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "b6ae6fc47ecc72d92512f6c6adb4475053130264", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2124079745", "ArXiv": "1011.0932", "DOI": "10.1088/0004-637X/721/1/137", "CorpusId": 118506156}, "title": "The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey: \u03bb = 1.1 and 0.35 mm dust continuum emission in the Galactic center region", "abstract": "The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) data for a 6\u00a0deg2 region of the Galactic plane containing the Galactic center are analyzed and compared to infrared and radio continuum data.

The impact of VOC and NO{sub x} emission reductions on the export of primary and secondary O{sub 3} precursor compounds is more complex, leading to reductions in the export of some species and enhancements in the export of others. {copyright} 1998 American Geophysical Union\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "40bcfc530fb7b126d0b8fcdff4704df099be39a4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "938010386", "CorpusId": 51946412}, "title": "Energy conservation and emissions reduction strategies in foundry industry", "abstract": "\u5728\u94c1\u548c\u94a2\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7cbe\u529b\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u6392\u51fa\u7269\u51cf\u5c0f\u7b56\u7565\u662f reviewed.Since \u94f8\u9020\u5de5\u4e1a\u662f\u7cbe\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6392\u653e(\u7279\u522b CO2 )\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u5173\u8282\u7701\u7cbe\u529b\u5e76\u4e14\u6392\u653e\u51cf\u5c0f\u88ab\u653f\u5e9c\u63d0\u8d77\u4e86\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u6574\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u7684 industry.Specialists \u5728\u94c1\u548c\u94a2\u5de5\u4e1a\u5728\u7cbe\u529b\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u6392\u51fa\u7269\u51cf\u5c0f\u5728\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6c42\u5a5a", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "0c22e8646ad1f38c71d63327e9c61576db9dbe9f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2759590298", "DOI": "10.1021/ACSSUSCHEMENG.7B02788", "CorpusId": 104254692}, "title": "Nanostructured gold/bismutite hybrid heterocatalysts for plasmon-enhanced photosynthesis of ammonia", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N2) reduction to produce ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important chemical processes globally.

The fine particles (PM2.5) in China have decreased significantly in\nrecent years as a result of the implementation of Chinese Clean Air Action Plan\nsince 2013, while the O3 pollution is getting worse, especially in\nmegacities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Better understanding of the elevated\nO3 pollution in Chinese megacities and its response to emission change\nis important for developing an effective emission control strategy in\nthe future. In this study, we analyze the significant increasing trend of daily\nmaximum O3 concentration from 2006 to 2015 in the megacity Shanghai\nwith the variability of 0.8\u20131.3\u2009ppbv\u2009yr\u22121. It could likely be attributed to\nthe notable reduction in NOx concentrations with the decreasing rate of\n1.86\u20132.15\u2009ppbv\u2009yr\u22121 accompanied by the small change in VOCs during\nthe same period by excluding the weak trends of meteorological impacts on\nlocal dispersion (wind speed), regional transport (wind direction), and\nO3 photolysis (solar radiation). It is further illustrated by using a\nstate-of-the-art regional chemical and dynamical model (WRF-Chem) to explore the\nO3 variation response to the reduction in NOx emissions in\nShanghai. The control experiment conducted for September of 2009 shows\nexcellent performance for O3 and NOx simulations, including both\nthe spatial distribution pattern and the day-by-day variation through\ncomparison with six in situ measurements from the MIRAGE-Shanghai field campaign.\nSensitivity experiments with 30\u2009% reduction in NOx emissions from 2009\nto 2015 in Shanghai estimated by Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center\nshows that the calculated O3 concentrations exhibit obvious enhancement\nby 4\u20137\u2009ppbv in urban zones with increasing variability of 0.96\u20131.06\u2009ppbv\u2009yr\u22121, which is consistent with the observed O3 trend as a\nresult of the strong VOC-limited condition for O3 production. The large\nreduction in NOx combined with less change in VOCs in the past 10\nyears promotes the O3 production in Shanghai to move towards\nan NOx-limited regime. Further analysis of the WRF-Chem experiments and\nO3 isopleth diagram suggests that the O3 production downtown\nis still under a VOC-limited regime after 2015 despite the remarkable\nNOx reduction, while it moves to the transition regime between\nNOx-limited and VOC-limited in sub-urban zones. Supposing the\ninsignificant VOC variation persists, the O3 concentration downtown\nwould keep increasing until 2020 with the further 20\u2009% reduction in\nNOx emission after 2015 estimated by Shanghai Clean Air Action Plan.\nThe O3 production in Shanghai will switch from a VOC-limited to\nan NOx-limited regime after 2020 except for downtown area, which is likely\nclose to the transition regime. As a result the O3 concentration will\ndecrease by 2\u20133\u2009ppbv in sub-urban zones and by more than 4\u2009ppbv in rural areas as a response to a 20\u2009% reduction in NOx emission after 2020, whereas it is not\nsensitive to both NOx and VOC changes downtown.

The net effectiveness of emission control measures was investigated further under comparable weather conditions before and during the parade. By excluding the effects of meteorological parameters, the total PM1 mass was reduced by 52-57% because of the emission controls. Although the mass concentrations of aerosol species were reduced substantially, the PM1 bulk composition was similar before and during the control period as a consequence of synergetic control of various precursors. The emission restrictions also suppressed the secondary formation processes of sulfate and nitrate, indicated by the substantially reduced SOR and NOR (molar ratios of sulfate or nitrate to the sums of the sulfate and SO2 or nitrate and NO2) during the event.

In fact, anthropogenic NOx induced photochemistry may have compensated for the strong OH reduction which would have resulted from anthropogenic CO and CH4 emissions alone.

Traditional land management (no tillage, no drainage, NTND) during the winter fallow season results in substantial CH4 and N2O emissions from double-rice fields in China. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of drainage and tillage during the winter fallow season on CH4 and N2O emissions and to develop mitigation options. The experiment had four treatments: NTND, NTD (drainage but no tillage), TND (tillage but no drainage), and TD (both drainage and tillage). The study was conducted from 2010 to 2014 in a Chinese double-rice field. During winter, total precipitation and mean daily temperature significantly affected CH4 emission.

Drainage and tillage significantly decreased the abundance of methanogens in paddy soil, and this may explain the decrease of CH4 emissions. Greenhouse gas intensity was significantly decreased by drainage and tillage separately, and the reduction was greater by combining drainage with tillage, resulting in a reduction of 0.17\u202ft\u202fCO2\u00a0eq.\u202ft\u22121.

This paper presents emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitric oxide (NO) from thermal power plants in India for a period of nine years from 2001-02 to 2009-10. The emission estimates are based on a model in which the mass emission factors are theoretically calculated using the basic principles of combustion and operating conditions. Future emission scenarios for the period up to 2020-21 are generated based on the estimates of the nine years from 2001-02 to 2009-10. Power plants in India use different qualities of coal, different combustion technologies and operating conditions. As a result, these plants have differences in achieved efficiencies (coal usage per unit of electricity). The estimates show region wise differences in total emissions as well as differences in emissions per unit of electricity. Computed estimates show the total CO2 emissions from thermal power plants have increased from 323474.85 Gg for the year 2001-02 to 498655.78 Gg in 2009-10. SO2 emissions increased from 2519.93 Gg in 2001-02 to 3840.44 Gg in 2009-10, while NO emissions increased from 1502.07 Gg to 2314.95 Gg during this period. The emissions per unit of electricity are estimated to be in the range of 0.91 to 0.95 kg/kWh for CO2, 6.94 to 7.20 g/kWh for SO2, and 4.22 to 4.38 g/kWh for NO during the period 2001-02 to 2009-10. The future emission scenario, based on the projected coal consumption in Indian thermal power plants by Planning Commission of India under \u2018Business-as Usual (BAU)\u2019 and \u201cBest case Scenario (BCS)\u2019 show the emission in the range of 714976 to 914680 Gg CO2, 4734 to 6051 Gg SO2 and 366 to 469 Gg NO in the year 2020-21. Increase in coal use efficiencies in electricity generation by thermal power plants can significantly reduce the emissions of greenhouse and polluting gases. This methodology provides a useful tool for inventory preparation in a sector where measured values for emissions factors are very sparse. INTRODUCTION Emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants are increasing in India with the increasing demand for electricity. The aspiration for rapid economic growth leading to rapid industrialization coupled with accelerated urbanization and mechanization of agriculture has been responsible for this increasing demand of electricity ever since the independence. The electricity consumption grew from 375.39 (billion kWh) in 2000 to 600.65 (billion kWh) in 2008 at an annual growth rate of 6.67% , while the electric power generation grew from 529.12 billion kWh in 2000 to 835.27 billion kWh at an annual growth rate of 5.78% (www.eia.doe.gov, 2010). Fig. 1 shows the growth of electricity generation and usage in India and China during the period 2000 to 2008 based on the EIA (www.eia.doe.gov, 2010) 2 data. Large difference between electric power generation and consumption are due to transmission and distribution losses. In India, the losses are extremely high and vary between 30 to 45%. To ensure \u2018Power on Demand\u2019, India has envisioned an additional generating capacity of 100,000 MW by the year 2012. It is estimated that electricity demand outstrips supply by 7-11%. With India\u2019s population of more than a billion that is growing at an annual rate of about 2% (World Bank, 2000), the gap between demand and supply of the electricity may rise further. India \u2019s current (www.powermin.nic.in \u2013 Annual Report 2008-09) electric power availability is approximately 11.1 % short of demand with peak load shortages of 11.9 %, whereas in 2000-01, power capacity was 7.8 % short of demand with peak load shortage of 13%. Percentage of the electric energy shortage and peak shortage from the period 2000-01 to 2008-09 are shown in Fig. 2. Coal is the favorite fuel for the electricity generation in countries like India and China. Abundant supply of coal locally and sustained high prices for imported natural gas and oil make coal-fired generation of electricity more attractive economically. Coal is approximately 90% of the total fuel mix for electricity generation. Fig. 3 shows the percentage of generating capacity of all categories that includes natural gas, diesel, nuclear, hydro, and renewal energy sources like biomass power, urban & industrial waste power, and wind energy. Coal and lignite based power plants have approximately 54.42% of the total electric power generation capacity in India. However, relatively lower calorific value, coupled with high ash content and inefficient combustion technologies aggravates emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants from India\u2019s coal and lignite based thermal power plants. Main emissions from coal fired and lignite based thermal power plants are CO2, NOx, SOx, and air-borne inorganic particles such as fly ash, carbonaceous material (soot), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and other trace gas species. Thermal power plants, using about 70% of total coal in India (Garg et. al., 2002), are among the Large Point Sources (LPS) having significant contribution (47% each for CO2 and SO2) in the total LPS emissions in India. Only limited efforts (Chakraborty et al., 2008) have been made so far for measuring the plant specific emissions of different gases and particulate matter in India to generate plant specific emission factors. These measurements were taken at few small plants of less than 250 MW capacities. For preparing the national green house gas (GHG) emission inventories from electricity generation in Indian thermal power plants, default emission factors prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [IPCC, 1996] have so far been used along with the country specific net calorific values (NCV) of Indian coal types (INCCA, 2010). Earlier electric power generation from thermal power plants was estimated to have contributed about 96% of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during 1990 (ALGAS ,1998) while in 1994, it was estimated about 62% (NATCOM, 2004) and in 2007, it has been estimated about 69% of the total CO2-equivalent emissions from energy sector (INCCA, 2010). The differences between 1990 estimates and 1994 and 2007 estimates also capture the different methodological approaches followed in these sets of estimates. The IPCC default emission factors, used in Indian inventory estimation, represents the average of available emission values using the similar fuel and technical processes under similar national circumstances and do not account for Indian coal characteristics or the operating conditions at the various thermal power plants in India. A time series of emission trends of CO2, NOx, and SOx from the Indian coal fired and lignite based thermal power plants over a decade (2001-02 to 2009-10) is presented here. Eighty six power plants with total installed capacity of 77682 MW are considered in this analysis for which required input 3 data was available from Central Electricity Authority of India (CEA). These plants represent about 76% of the total installed capacity of thermal power plants in India. As of March 2010, there are 105 thermal power plants in India of more than 100 MW capacity each, with total installed generation capacity of 93772 MW. As per the CEA (www.cea.nic.in, 2011), public sector thermal power plants have total installed capacity of about 87592 MW while the private sector has a total installed capacity of about 14962 MW which include captive thermal power plants of less than 100 MW installed capacity. The combustion technology in these 86 plants is based on pulverized coal burning but the type of furnace technology, design of the boiler, forced draught fans etc. differ with plants. Based on the CEA data (www.cea.nic.in 2010), specific coal usage at three plants is less than 0.6 kg/kWh, at 19 plants, usage is between 0.6-07 kg/kWh, thirty nine plants use coal between 0.7-0.8 kg/kWh, fifteen plants use between 0.8-0.9 kg/kWh, seven plants use between 0.9-1.0 kg/kWh, and at three plants coal usage exceeds 1.0 kg/kWh. Hence the efficiency of the plants and the coal usage per unit of electricity generation also differ at each plant. There is a need to modernize India\u2019s thermal power plants and reduce the coal usage per unit of electricity generation (kg/kWh). Modernization with reduction in coal usage (kg/kWh) will help in reducing the national emissions. Quality of Indian coal will remain same but with the improvement in combustion technologies, emissions can be reduced. It is estimated that 1% to 2% increase in heat rate improvements leading to efficiency improvement will result in 1% to 2% decrease in emissions per unit of electricity (USAID/TVA/NTPC 2000). Here, the emission factors for each of the 86 plants are computed based on the basic principles of coal combustion, characteristics of the coal used in different thermal power plants, and the operating conditions in these plants. This methodology provides a `bottom-up\u2019 approach for the development of emission inventory. This is the first study where emission inventory of CO2, SO2, and NO are developed specifically for coal fired thermal power plants in India based on the characteristic of coal and operating conditions prevalent at the plant. METHODOLOGY The combustion process of the pulverized coal in the boiler is a complicated non-linear phenomenon. The pollutants emitted from thermal power plants depend largely upon the characteristics of the fuel burned, temperature of the furnace, actual air used, and any additional devices to control the emissions. At present, the control devices used in thermal power plants in India is electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to control the emission of fly ash (SPM). Some new plants use low NOx burners for high temperature (> 1500 K) combustion technologies and dry/wet SO2 scrubber, if chimney height is less than 275 meters.

Significant energy savings in kraft mills can be made by e.g. improved heat integration and installation of an energy-efficient evaporation plant. The heat integration can be improved by solving pinch violations or by extracting high-temperature excess heat that can be used in a specially designed evaporation plant. In this study, these two approaches were applied to different model mills: a market pulp mill and an integrated fine paper mill (both with a pulp production of 1000 ADt/day). In the market pulp mill, both approaches for heat integration resulted in steam savings of about 4.5 GJ/ADt (26% of the steam demand) for an investment cost of about 10 M\u20ac. Owing to inherent process differences, the steam savings were about 15% lower for about 20% higher investment cost in the integrated mill. The methods and basic results have also been verified in a case study of a real market pulp mill. \n \nThe energy savings enable an increase of the electricity production by about 120 GWh/year (about 50%) in both the market pulp mill and the integrated mill. As an alternative to increased electricity production, the use of internal biofuel can be decreased, enabling export of about 450 GWh/year of lignin from the market pulp mill (requiring that lignin is separated from the black liquor) or about 415 GWh/year of bark from the integrated mill. The economy for electricity and biofuel export depends mainly on the energy prices and investment costs. With expected future energy prices, both approaches can be profitable in the integrated mill. In the market pulp mill, electricity production seems to be the most robust alternative due to the investment and operating costs related to a lignin separation plant. However, lignin separation decreases the load of the recovery boiler and can thus be a cost-effective alternative for debottlenecking the recovery boiler in a case of increased pulp production. \n \nSince no fossil fuel is used in any of these mills, the energy export does not change the net CO2 emissions from the mills. Instead, the reductions in CO2 emissions will be off-site, where fossil fuel or fossil-fuel-based electricity is substituted. The potential for reductions in global CO2 emissions for a future situation were assessed by using four energy market scenarios. The total potential, if applied to all kraft pulp and paper mills in Sweden, is comparable with the Swedish goal for reducing the CO2 emissions by 2.9 million tonnes during 2008-2012 (based on the emissions in 1990).", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d0d98fa6c1b4b27475cad6baac9e692468c7c2ea", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2897462358", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-19-1721-2019", "CorpusId": 56208020}, "title": "Impact of a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) on the future air quality and nitrogen deposition to seawater in the Baltic Sea region", "abstract": "Abstract. Air pollution due to shipping is a serious concern for coastal regions in\nEurope. Shipping emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in air\nover the Baltic Sea are of similar magnitude (330\u2009kt\u2009yr\u22121) as the\ncombined land-based NOx emissions from Finland and Sweden in\nall emission sectors. Deposition of nitrogen compounds originating from\nshipping activities contribute to eutrophication of the Baltic Sea and\ncoastal areas in the Baltic Sea region. For the North Sea and the Baltic Sea\na nitrogen emission control area (NECA) will become effective in 2021; in\naccordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) target of\nreducing NOx emissions from ships. Future scenarios for 2040\nwere designed to study the effect of enforced and planned regulation of ship\nemissions and the fuel efficiency development on air quality and nitrogen\ndeposition. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to\nsimulate the current and future air quality situation. The meteorological\nfields, the emissions from ship traffic and the emissions from land-based\nsources were considered at a grid resolution of 4\u00d74\u2009km2\nfor the Baltic Sea region in nested CMAQ simulations. Model simulations for\nthe present-day (2012) air quality show that shipping emissions are the major\ncontributor to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations\nover the Baltic Sea. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, with the\nintroduction of the NECA, NOx emissions from ship traffic in\nthe Baltic Sea are reduced by about 80\u2009% in 2040. An approximate linear\nrelationship was found between ship emissions of NOx and the\nsimulated levels of annual average NO2 over the Baltic Sea in the\nyear 2040, when following different future shipping scenarios. The burden of\nfine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the Baltic Sea region is predicted\nto decrease by 35\u2009%\u201337\u2009% between 2012 and 2040. The reduction in\nPM2.5 is larger over sea, where it drops by 50\u2009%\u201360\u2009% along the\nmain shipping routes, and is smaller over the coastal areas. The introduction\nof NECA is critical for reducing ship emissions of NOx to\nlevels that are low enough to sustainably dampen ozone (O3)\nproduction in the Baltic Sea region. A second important effect of the NECA\nover the Baltic Sea region is the reduction in secondary formation of\nparticulate nitrate. This lowers the ship-related PM2.5 by 72\u2009% in\n2040 compared to the present day, while it is reduced by only 48\u2009%\nwithout implementation of the NECA. The effect of a lower fuel efficiency\ndevelopment on the absolute ship contribution of air pollutants is limited.\nStill, the annual mean ship contributions in 2040 to NO2, sulfur\ndioxide and PM2.5 and daily maximum O3 are significantly\nhigher if a slower fuel efficiency development is assumed. Nitrogen\ndeposition to the seawater of the Baltic Sea decreases on average by\n40\u2009%\u201344\u2009% between 2012 and 2040 in the simulations. The effect of\nthe NECA on nitrogen deposition is most significant in the western part of\nthe Baltic Sea. It will be important to closely monitor compliance of\nindividual ships with the enforced and planned emission regulations.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1b470c73803a66b6bfe154b49411fd47fab58447", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2463132786", "DOI": "10.1007/s11270-011-0998-z", "CorpusId": 99514690}, "title": "Characteristics of Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Emissions from Intermittently-Aerated Sequencing Batch Reactors Treating the Separated Liquid Fraction of Anaerobically Digested Pig Manure", "abstract": "In this study, the N2O emission from an intermittently aerated sequencing batch reactor (IASBR-1) treating the separated liquid fraction of anaerobically digested pig manure (SLAP) was investigated.

It is shown that the transition value of NOy depends on the hydrocarbon and NOx emissions, on water vapor, on radiation, and on temperature. Increasing hydrocarbon emissions, increasing water vapor, increasing radiation, or increasing temperature shifts the transition value to higher levels. One-dimensional simulations, which include vertical mixing and dry deposition, show that increasing dry deposition reduces the transition value of NOy. Sensitivity studies with a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic model system are carried out to investigate the effects of transport. A smoothing procedure is applied to reduce the large scatter of the O3-NOy relation which is found in these cases. After smoothing, a transition value can be identified. For the southwestern part of Germany it is shown that this transition value indicates areas where NOx reduction leads to the most effective ozone reduction.

The normalization procedure is applied to the model results and to observations. Under high-NOx conditions a large difference between the cases with and without advection is found.

Uncertainty of carbon emission estimates depends on scale while local stakeholders' views on plausible REDD+ schemes influence and limit transaction costs. The uncertainty analysis formed the basis for determining an appropriate scale for monitoring carbon emission estimates as performance measures for REDD+ incentives. Our analysis of stakeholder\u2019 perspectives explored (i) potential location and activities for lower emission development pathways, and (ii) perceived fair allocation of REDD+incentives. Our case study focused on frontier forest in Tanjung Jabung Barat District, Jambi, Indonesia. The uncertainty analysis used Monte Carlo simulation techniques using known inaccuracy of land cover classification and variation in carbon stocks assessment per land cover type. With decreasing spatial resolution of carbon emission maps, uncertainty in carbon estimates decreased. At 1\u00a0km2 resolution uncertainty dropped below 5\u00a0%, retaining most of the coarser spatial variation in the district. Fairness, efficiency and transaction cost issues in the design of REDD+ mechanisms were readily recognized by local stakeholders, who converged on an equal allocation to short-term efficiency (emission reduction activities) and long-term fairness (alternative livelihood development). A striking difference occurred in desirable transaction costs (which include monitoring, reporting and verification), with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) aiming for 8\u00a0%, while government and researchers accepted transaction costs of 40\u00a0%.

From 1953 to 2007, total CO2 emissions increased over quadruple. In general, the increasing process can be divided into four stages: a low growth stage during the period 1953 to 1980 with showing a fast but unsteady increasing rate and a small increasing magnitude; a steady growth stage during the period 1981 to 1996 with showing a steady increasing rate and a large increasing magnitude; a slowly decreasing stage during period 1997 to 2000 with indicating a slightly decreasing trend in CO2 emissions; a rapid growth stage during the period 2001 to 2007 with exhibiting a rapid increasing rate and a large increasing magnitude. In the present research, the authors made use of a factor decomposition model to quantify the effects of reductions in CO2 emissions resulting from three factors, i.e., growth of the economic total amount, evolution of industry structure, and variations in CO2 intensity during the period 1980 to 2007. Results showed that GDP and industry structure are the primary factors resulting in increases in CO2 emissions and decreasing intensity of CO2 emissions is the only factor causing effects on significant CO2 emissions. It was estimated that the contribution value of GDP was 1688 million during the period 1980-2000 and 1031 million during the period in 2001-2007; the contribution value of industry structure was 242 million during the period 1980-2000 and 78 million during the period 2001-2007; the contribution value of CO2 intensity was -1322 million during the period 1980-2000 and -54 million during the period 2001-2007. To this end, effective paths to substantially reduce CO2 emissions are adjustment of the industry structure and effectively decreasing CO2 intensity which depends largely on the change in energy consumption structure and improvements in energy utilization efficiency. As China is experiencing a middle stage of industrialization and urbanization, heavy industry inevitably becomes the dominant industry. Domestic demands for energy intensive products such as steel and cement tend not to decrease dramatically in the short-term. It was suggested that adjusting industry structure must mach with adjusting trade structure whose CO2 emissions are also considerable. Due to limitations in energy resources, capital and technology, China would not be able to fundamentally change energy consumption structure in the short-term. However, actively increasing oil and gas imports and developing renewable energy are considered long-term task. Meanwhile, China can develop coal clean technology to reduce environmental pollution and degradation. Although China\u2019s energy intensity has been decreasing recently, the energy intensity of some energy intensive industries are still higher than developed countries\u2019 levels. There is, however, large room to continuously decrease CO2 intensity by improving energy utilization efficiency for China.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "57a201ec1d9513ef664edb6173e109e80bcc19dc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023122461", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2002.1021", "CorpusId": 2549023, "PubMed": "12460486"}, "title": "Changes in the use and management of forests for abating carbon emissions: issues and challenges under the Kyoto Protocol", "abstract": "The global carbon cycle is significantly influenced by changes in the use and management of forests and agriculture.

However, controversy over the use of biological means to absorb or reduce emissions of CO2 (often referred to as carbon \u2018sinks\u2019) has arisen in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. The controversy is based primarily on two arguments: sinks may allow developed nations to delay or avoid actions to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the technical and operational difficulties are too threatening to the successful implementation of land use and forestry projects for providing carbon offsets. Here we discuss the importance of including carbon sinks in efforts to address global warming and the consequent additional social, environmental and economic benefits to host countries. Activities in tropical forest lands provide the lowest cost methods both of reducing emissions and reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. We conclude that the various objections raised as to the inclusion of carbon sinks to ameliorate climate change can be addressed by existing techniques and technology.

Carbon labelling is being explored as a mechanism for greenhouse gas emission reduction primarily by private actors. This paper discusses the carbon accounting activities and carbon labelling schemes that are being developed to address these concerns with a view to their impact on small stakeholders, especially low income countries. This discussion centres on transportation, and the common presumption that products produced locally in the country of consumption will have an advantage in terms of carbon emissions, and on size. Exports from low income countries typically depend on long distance transportation and are produced by relatively small firms and tiny farms who will find it difficult to participate in complex carbon labelling schemes. However, the popular belief that trade by definition is problematic since it necessitates transportation, which is a major source of emissions, is generally not true. The scientific evidence shows that carbon efficiencies elsewhere in the supply chain may more than offset the emissions associated with transportation. Indeed, the effective inclusion of low income countries in labelling schemes may offer important opportunities for carbon emission reductions due to their favourable climactic conditions and their current use of low energy intensive production techniques. The disadvantages of small size can be reduced by carbon labelling schemes that use innovative solutions to low cost data collection and certification.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "1d1e8806d7d327db8bebf5ef42afb4a0db880b33", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017881169", "DOI": "10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/057", "CorpusId": 20253207, "PubMed": "20818015"}, "title": "Cu nanoparticles derived from CuO electrodes in lithium cells.", "abstract": "Nanosheet cupric oxide (CuO) was synthesized by a hydrothermal synthesis method and its electrochemical performance was tested with Li metal as the reference anode.

Here, the potential to complement these efforts by actions to enhance the reflectance of solar insolation by the human settlement and grassland components of the Earth's terrestrial surface is explored. Preliminary estimates derived using a static two dimensional radiative transfer model indicate that such efforts could amplify the overall planetary albedo enough to offset the current global annual average level of radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases by as much as 30% or 0.76 Wm\u2212 2. Terrestrial albedo amplification may thus extend, by about 25 years, the time available to advance the development and use of low-emission energy conversion technologies which ultimately remain essential to mitigate long-term climate change. While a scoping analysis indicates the technical feasibility of sufficiently enhancing human settlement and grassland albedos to levels needed to achieve reductions in radiative forcing projected here, additional study is required on two fronts. Firstly, the modelled radiative forcing reductions are static estimates. As they would generate climate feedbacks, more detailed dynamic climate modelling would be needed to confirm the stationary value of the radiative forcing reduction that would result from land surface albedo amplification.
