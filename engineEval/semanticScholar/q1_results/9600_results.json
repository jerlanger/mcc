The utility of the Scholl Canyon model to determine greenhouse gas generation for different waste management options at specific sites is explored in this paper looking at Brady Road Landfill in Winnipeg, Canada. Determination of the feasibility of methane recovery for Brady Road Landfill required three steps: 1) measuring landfill gas composition and site conditions; 2) inputting field data as constants, as well as accepted constants, into the Scholl Canyon model to determine gas generation under different waste management options such as different composting programs; and 3) comparing greenhouse gas production according to the Scholl Canyon model. Modeling results indicate that it is feasible to recover methane at Brady Road Landfill under different waste management scenarios that include a composting program that is highly successful in diverting waste. Estimates of gas generation at Brady Road Landfill show it is possible and lucrative to harvest landfill gas, with or without composting, which would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "014b25f16cb7bfab62a647c1c9d29c41fbaa9ea5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2155265519", "DOI": "10.1007/S12237-010-9307-0", "CorpusId": 86151657}, "title": "Biocalcification in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Relation to Long-term Trends in Chesapeake Bay pH", "abstract": "Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduce pH of marine waters due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2 and formation of carbonic acid. Estuarine waters are more susceptible to acidification because they are subject to multiple acid sources and are less buffered than marine waters. Consequently, estuarine shell forming species may experience acidification sooner than marine species although the tolerance of estuarine calcifiers to pH changes is poorly understood. We analyzed 23\u00a0years of Chesapeake Bay water quality monitoring data and found that daytime average pH significantly decreased across polyhaline waters although pH has not significantly changed across mesohaline waters. In some tributaries that once supported large oyster populations, pH is increasing. Current average conditions within some tributaries however correspond to values that we found in laboratory studies to reduce oyster biocalcification rates or resulted in net shell dissolution. Calcification rates of juvenile eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were measured in laboratory studies in a three-way factorial design with 3\u00a0pH levels, two salinities, and two temperatures.

The absorption spectrum of [PtF(28)TPP] in CH(2)Cl(2) displays a near-UV Soret band (B) at 383 nm (epsilon = 2.85 x 10(5) dm(3) mol(-1) cm(-1)) and two visible Q(1,0) and Q(0,0) bands at 501 (epsilon = 1.45 x 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1) cm(-1)) and 533 (epsilon = 1.36 x 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1) cm(-1)) nm, respectively. These absorption bands of [PtF(28)TPP] are blue-shifted from those in [PtF(20)TPP] (390, 504, and 538 nm, respectively) and [PtTPP] (401, 509, and 539 nm, respectively). Excitation of [PtF(28)TPP] (complex concentration = 1.5 x 10(-6) mol dm(-3)) in dichloromethane at the Soret or Q(1,0) or Q(0,0) band gave a phosphorescence with peak maximum at 650 nm (lifetime = 5.8 micros) and a weak shoulder at 712 nm.

The porphyrin-centered reduction of [PtF(28)TPP] occurs at -0.75 and -1.18 V, which is anodically shifted from those at -1.06 and -1.55 V in [PtF(20)TPP], and -1.51 V in [PtTPP], respectively. The excited-state reduction potential of [PtF(28)TPP] is estimated to be 1.49 V versus Ag/AgNO(3). Over 97% of the emission intensity of [PtF(28)TPP] was retained after irradiation with a high power mercury arc lamp (500 W) for 14 h, compared to 90% and 12% for [PtF(20)TPP] and [PtTPP], respectively; hence, [PtF(28)TPP] exhibits superior photostability.

This mechanism, known as \u201cavoided deforestation,\u201d would benefit developing countries that voluntarily reduce their deforestation rates, thereby generating at least two positive impacts: (a) an increase in the financial resources available to curb tropical deforestation, with expected positive side effects on biodiversity conservation, the environmental services provided by these forests, and sustainable development as a whole; and (b) a greater effectiveness of the global fight against climate change, because tropical deforestation contributes extensively to world carbon emissions. Several proposals were designed for such a mechanism, yet their implementation poses significant methodological problems: first, sophisticated tools available to measure the reduction of emissions might be ineffective when combined with baselines on a national level; secondly, baselines calculated ex ante lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the direct and underlying causes of deforestation; thirdly, baselines calculated ex post lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, it is challenging to relate a reduction in deforestation rates to public policy options in the host country.Drawing lessons from our analysis of the methodological problems for the implementation of the mechanism, we recommend not promoting any mechanism based on financial rewards for an assumed voluntary reduction of national tropical deforestation rates. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions (\u201chot air\u201d), but undesirable side effects\u2014detailed in this paper\u2014would also appear. Instead, we encourage industrialized countries to better use already existing multi- and bilateral instruments, which focus on the correction of governance deficiencies in countries home to tropical forests.

The system proposed was tested with simulations, off-line averaging and real-time implementation of the ANC algorithm. Simulation results showed that the technique had a potential noise reduction capability of 24 dB for complex multifrequency noise signals.

This study employs a regional integrated assessment model and a regional Earth system model at high spatial and temporal resolutions in the Unites States to compare the implications of two of the representative concentration pathways under consistent socioeconomics. The results clearly show, for the first time to our knowledge, that climate change mitigation policies, if not designed with careful attention to water resources, could increase the magnitude, spatial coverage, and frequency of water deficits. The results challenge the general perception that mitigation that aims at reducing warming also would alleviate water deficits in the future. There is evidence that warming leads to greater evapotranspiration and surface drying, thus contributing to increasing intensity and duration of drought and implying that mitigation would reduce water stresses. However, understanding the overall impact of climate change mitigation on water resources requires accounting for the second part of the equation, i.e., the impact of mitigation-induced changes in water demands from human activities. By using integrated, high-resolution models of human and natural system processes to understand potential synergies and/or constraints within the climate\u2013energy\u2013water nexus, we show that in the United States, over the course of the 21st century and under one set of consistent socioeconomics, the reductions in water stress from slower rates of climate change resulting from emission mitigation are overwhelmed by the increased water stress from the emissions mitigation itself.

The process of vehicle routing optimisation involves a geographical information system. This optimisation has enabled a reduction of travelled distances, collection time, fuel consumption and polluting emissions. Pertinent parameters affecting the fuel consumption have been utilised, such as the state of the road, the vehicles speed in the different paths, the vehicles load and collection frequencies. Several scenarios have been proposed. The results show the importance of the construction of a waste transfer station that can reduce the cost of household waste collection and emissions of waste transfer pollutants. Among the proposed five scenarios, we have noticed that the fourth scenario (by constructing a waste transfer centre) was the most performing. So, the routes of optimised travelled distance of the new circuits have been reduced by 71.81%.

Performance and material property data were obtained from 14 field projects. Each of the 14 projects included single- or multiple-WMA technology pavement sections and an HMA control section. A total of 12 WMA technologies were investigated. All projects used \u201cdrop in\u201d WMA mix designs where the WMA technology was used with an existing HMA mix design with no significant changes to the binder content or other aspects of the mix design. Except for the reduced mixing and compaction temperatures for WMA, there were no substantial differences in the production and laydown practices of WMA and HMA. In-service performance of WMA and HMA in all projects was virtually identical, with little or no rutting, no evidence of moisture damage, and very little indication of transverse or longitudinal cracking. Energy use, plant and paver emissions, and worker exposure to fumes were extensively measured at three multiple-WMA technology projects. Compared to HMA, the reduced temperatures used in WMA production and laydown yielded lower energy consumption and emissions and reduced worker exposure to respirable fumes. Overall, then, no penalties and some potential benefits were observed in the short term when WMA replaced HMA. The key finding of laboratory testing of WMA binders and mixtures from the projects sampled at construction was the expected lower stiffness of the WMA materials that would have potential effects on pavement rutting and cracking. However, the equivalent performance of the WMA and HMA pavement sections over several years of service suggests that these differences in material properties, when present, were not great enough to affect the relative performances of HMA and WMA.

However, in spite of the rapid expansion of LAC tropical agriculture, little is known about its impact on atmospheric trace gases emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are produced in soils by microbial processes and also accelerated in tropical climates. This information is crucial for assessing mitigation strategies linked to agricultural practices to satisfy food demands for the region\u2019s future. We measured NO, N2O and CO2 soil emissions along with soil variables from corn fields under tillage (T) and no-tillage (NT) agriculture at two of the largest cereal-producing regions in Venezuela during the crop-growing season. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the logarithms of nitrogen gas emissions and soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, soil water and clay contents. Average emissions of NO and CO2 were larger in T than NT sites, while N2O fluxes showed the opposite. CO2 emissions from T were 1.6 as much as those found in NT, whereas N2O was 0.5 of that found in NT. These results imply that NT practices more effectively mitigate climate change from these monoculture systems mainly because of CO2 emission reduction. We suggest then that agricultural mitigation actions for tropical monoculture systems should aim for the enhancement of NT management practices along with N fertilization rate reduction to compensate for the larger N2O emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b2c434389d000f582088347046b5a487f7abe029", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2767760004", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02663", "CorpusId": 206510056, "PubMed": "29115126"}, "title": "Aggregation-Induced Emission-Based Chemodosimeter Approach for Selective Sensing and Imaging of Hg(II) and Methylmercury Species.", "abstract": "Methylmercury (CH3Hg+) is the common form of organic mercury and is more toxic than its inorganic or elemental forms.

The aim of this study was to quantify the genetic variation of methane emission by Dutch Holstein Friesian cows measured using infrared sensors installed in automatic milking systems (AMS). Measurements of CH4 and CO2 on 1,508 Dutch Holstein Friesian cows located on 11 commercial dairy farms were available. Phenotypes per AMS visit were the mean of CH4, mean of CO2, mean of CH4 divided by mean of CO2, and their log10-transformations. The repeatabilities of the log10-transformated methane phenotypes were 0.27 for CH4, 0.31 for CO2, and 0.14 for the ratio. The log10-transformated heritabilities of these phenotypes were 0.11 for CH4, 0.12 for CO2, and 0.03 for the ratio. These results indicate that measurements taken using infrared sensors in AMS are repeatable and heritable and, thus, could be used for selection for lower CH4 emission. Furthermore, it is important to account for farm, AMS, day of measurement, time of day, and lactation stage when estimating genetic parameters for methane phenotypes.

The WARM GHG emission factors are used to compare the net emissions associated with PCs in the following four materials management alternatives: source reduction, recycling, landfilling, and combustion. For background information on the general purpose and function of WARM emission factors, see the Introduction & Overview chapter. For more information on Source Reduction, Recycling, Landfilling, and Combustion, see the chapters devoted to those processes. WARM also allows users to calculate results in terms of energy, rather than GHGs. The energy results are calculated using the same methodology described here but with slight adjustments, as explained in the Energy Impacts chapter. The main components of a PC are the central processing units (CPU) and the monitor. The PC modeled in WARM is based on a typical desktop PC with a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. The CPU consists of housing (mostly steel) and internal electronic components, while the monitor's primary components are the CRT, plastic case and circuit boards. The wide range of PC models makes it difficult to specify the exact composition of a typical PC, and PC technology continues to evolve rapidly. For WARM analysis, EPA considers the CPU and CRT monitor, while the peripheral equipment (e.g., keyboards, external cables, printers) are left out of the analysis. Flat-panel monitors are now dominant in today's market, having displaced CRT monitors that were common in the 1990's and early 2000's. Although flat-panel monitors are beginning to enter the MSW stream in larger quantities, CRT monitors are still present and will likely remain a sizable component of end-of-life electronics for a number of years. Upon disposal, PCs can be recovered for recycling, sent to a landfill or combusted. Exhibit 1 shows the general outline of materials management pathways in WARM. Recycling PCs is an open-loop process, meaning that components are recycled into secondary materials such as asphalt, steel sheet, lead bullion, CRT glass, copper wire and aluminum sheet. PCs are collected curbside and at special events, or individuals can bring them to designated drop-off sites. Once PCs have been collected for recycling, they are sent to Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) that specialize in separating and recovering materials from electronic products.

Yet CE interventions provide only imperfect corrections for the climatic and other environmental effects of elevated greenhouse gases, and carry their own environmental risks. Moreover, they may also increase other risks, by weakening political support for essential emissions reductions or providing new triggers for international conflict.

Effective governance of CE will require a capacity to make decisions regarding the conditions, if any, under which specific interventions are authorized, plus realtime operational oversight of any interventions that are conducted. Decision processes must be effectively linked with scientific research and assessment, and with institutions to manage and respond to threats of CE-related conflict. We advance preliminary suggestions to address two priority areas for early investigation: how international cooperation on early CE research can help develop shared norms that can grow robust enough to support future decision needs; and how early research and development on CE can be made to complement and encourage, rather than undermine, parallel efforts to reduce climate risks by cutting emissions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c2f766ecf60bc4c19c9b4570a0883b7db574f5ad", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "1212.5225", "MAG": "2001369144", "DOI": "10.1088/0067-0049/208/2/20", "CorpusId": 119271232}, "title": "Nine-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Final Maps and Results", "abstract": "We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission.

This paper reviews the current and future biofuel technologies, and their development impacts (including on the climate) within given policy and economic frameworks. Current technologies make it possible to provide first generation biodiesel, ethanol or biogas to the transport sector to be blended with fossil fuels. Still under-development 2nd generation biofuels from lignocellulose should be available on the market by 2020. Research is active on the improvement of their conversion efficiency. A ten-fold increase compared with current cost-effective capacities would make them highly competitive. Within bioenergy policies, emphasis has been put on biofuels for transportation as this sector is fast-growing and represents a major source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with fossil fuels, biofuel combustion can emit less greenhouse gases throughout their life cycle, considering that part of the emitted CO2 returns to the atmosphere where it was fixed from by photosynthesis in the first place. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is commonly used to assess the potential environmental impacts of biofuel chains, notably the impact on global warming. This tool, whose holistic nature is fundamental to avoid pollution trade-offs, is a standardised methodology that should make comparisons between biofuel and fossil fuel chains objective and thorough. However, it is a complex and time-consuming process, which requires lots of data, and whose methodology is still lacking harmonisation. Hence the life-cycle performances of biofuel chains vary widely in the** literature. Furthermore, LCA is a site- and time-independent tool that cannot take into account the spatial and temporal dimensions of emissions, and can hardly serve as a decision-making tool either at local or regional levels. Focusing on greenhouse gases, emission factors used in LCAs give a rough estimate of the potential average emissions on a national level. However, they do not take into account the types of crop, soil or management practices, for instance. Modelling the impact of local factors on the determinism of greenhouse gas emissions can provide better estimates for LCA on the local level, which would be the relevant scale and degree of reliability for decision-making purposes. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the processes involved, most notably N2O emissions, is still needed to definitely improve the accuracy of LCA. Perennial crops are a promising option for biofuels, due to their rapid and efficient use of nitrogen, and their limited farming operations. However, the main overall limiting factor to biofuel development will ultimately be land availability. Given the available land areas, population growth rate and consumption behaviours, it would be possible to reach by 2030 a global 10% biofuel share in the transport sector, contributing to lower global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 1 GtCO2 eq per year (IEA, 2006), provided that harmonised policies ensure that sustainability criteria for the production systems are respected worldwide. Furthermore, policies should also be more integrative across sectors, so that changes in energy efficiency, the automotive sector and global consumption patterns converge towards drastic reduction of the pressure on resources. Indeed, neither biofuels nor other energy source or carriers are likely to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic pressure on resources in a range that would compensate for this pressure growth. Hence, the first step is to reduce this pressure by starting from the variable that drives it up, i.e. anthropic consumptions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "fe58ce90a9f710eb175da4b5b4eba58bdd9e0ab9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2883514392", "DOI": "10.4209/AAQR.2015.06.0409", "CorpusId": 54717556}, "title": "Energy saving and pollution reduction by adding water containing iso-butanol and iso-propyl alcohol in a diesel engine", "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn this study, two diesel blends with different iso-butanol and isopropyl alcohol ratios, 5% iso-propanol with 15% iso-butanol and 1% iso-propanol and 19% iso-butanol, were used and compared against the performance of petroleum diesel as a base fuel. Additionally, water addition strategy was included for further comparison. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased with increasing ratios of iso-butanol and water fractions, since the heating value decreased resulting in more fuel being combusted to maintain the same power output. On the other hand, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increased with increasing water content. Specifically, P5B15W1 had a higher BTE than regular diesel at low engine loads (12 kW and 25 kW-LS). Compared to the regular diesel, the results show that in-cylinder pressures slightly increased while HRR had longer ignition delay with higher iso-butanol and water content. For the two different ratios of blended diesel, P1B19 registered NOx emission reductions factors by about 12\u201335% compared regular diesel due to its low heating value and combustion temperature, while those for P5B15 were reduced 8\u201333% in comparison to regular diesel. For CO and PM emission factors, P5B15 had better performance than P1B19 which showed 13\u201337% and 37\u201350% lower than regular diesel, respectively. However, HC emission factors were all greater than those of regular diesel with the highest increase being from P1B19. This diesel blend, P1B19 showed 6\u201330% and 3\u201310% higher HC emission factors than regular diesel and P5B15, respectively. For water containing blends, NOx emission factors decreased with an increase in water content. The trends for CO and PM emission factors were similar to those of non-water containing diesel blends. P5B15W1 had largest decrease which showed 5\u201317% and 7\u201326% lower CO and PM than regular diesel, respectively. Notably, the CO and PM emission factors are all higher than non-water contain blended diesel. As for HC, P5B15W1 had an increase of about 26\u201351%. Moreover, the total-PAHs emission factors between two different ratios of blended diesel were compared whereby P5B15 had 12\u201322% lower than P1B19. Besides, total-BaPeq emission factors are similar to total-PAHs emission, which P5B15 had largest reduction by 28\u201344%. In summary, P5B15 would be a best choice in terms of PM reduction, while the best choice for NOx control would be P1B19W0.5 blend.

In cats and humans, [11C]PHNO revealed an atypical distribution compared to radiolabeled D2\u2010like antagonists (such as [11C]raclopride) or other D2\u2010like agonists (such as [11C]NPA), as it displayed unusual high binding in the globus pallidus (GP). The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacological nature of the binding of [11C]PHNO in the GP in nonhuman primates. As previously reported in humans, [11C]PHNO equilibrium specific to nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficients (V3\u2033) in baboons was much higher in GP (3.88 \u00b1 1.15) than in the dorsal striatum (DST, 2.07 \u00b1 0.43), whereas the reverse was true for [11C]raclopride (1.48 \u00b1 0.41 in GP, 2.56 \u00b1 0.91 in DST) and [11C]NPA (0.87 \u00b1 0.19 in GP, 1.02 \u00b1 0.13 in DST). Administration of unlabeled raclopride resulted in similar reductions of [11C] PHNO V3\u2033 and [11C]raclopride V3\u2033 in both the GP and the DST. This observation demonstrated that the [11C]PHNO binding in the GP was specific to D2\u2010like receptors. To evaluate the respective contribution of D3 and D2 receptors to the binding potential (BP) of [11C]PHNO and [11C]raclopride, experiments were carried out with the selective D3 partial agonist 1\u2010(4(2\u2010Napthoylamino)butyl)\u20104\u2010(2\u2010methoxyphenyl)\u20101A\u2010piperazine HCL (BP897). BP897 reduced [11C]raclopride V3\u2033 by 29% \u00b1 9%, 19% \u00b1 8%, and 10% \u00b1 7% in GP, VST, and DST, respectively, a result consistent with expectation from postmortem studies (D3/D2 ratio in GP > VST > DST). BP897 reduced [11C]PHNO V3\u2033 by 57% \u00b1 11%, 30% \u00b1 11%, and 13% \u00b1 8% in GP, VST, and DST, respectively, indicating that the D3 receptor contribution to [11C]PHNO signal is higher than that of [11C]raclopride. From these experiments we conclude that [11C]PHNO is a D3 preferring agonist, and that this property explains the high GP signal not observed with [11C]raclopride or [11C]NPA. This property might contribute to its higher vulnerability to endogenous DA compared to [11C]raclopride and [11C]NPA.

This study examines the composition of diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions from a commercial agriculture tractor burning a range of biodiesel blends operating under a load that is controlled by a power take off (PTO) dynamometer. Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel was blended with soybean and beef tallow based biodiesel to examine fuels containing 0% (B0), 25% (B25), 50% (B50), 75% (B75), and 100% (B100) biodiesel. Samples were then collected using a dilution source sampler to simulate atmospheric dilution. Diluted and aged exhaust was analyzed for particle mass and size distribution, PM2.5 particle mass, PM2.5 organic and elemental carbon, and speciated organic compounds. PM2.5 mass emissions rates for the B25, B50, and B75 soybean oil biodiesel mixtures had 20%\u201330% lower emissions than the petroleum diesel, but B100 emissions were about 40% higher than the petroleum diesel. The trends in mass emission rates with the increasing biodiesel content can be explained by a significant decrease in elemental carbon (EC) emissions across all blending ranges and increasing organic carbon (OC) emissions with pure biodiesel. Beef tallow biodiesel blends showed similar trends. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the study measurements are based on low dilution rates and the OC emissions changes may be affected by ambient temperature and different dilution conditions spanning micro-environments and atmospheric conditions. The results show that the use of biodiesel fuel for economic or climate change mitigation purposes can lead to reductions in PM emissions and a co-benefit of EC emission reductions. Detailed speciation of the OC emissions were also examined and are presented to understand the sensitivity of OC emissions with respect to biodiesel fuel blends.

However, the co-benefits to health through reductions in energy and concomitant reductions in air pollution have not been examined.We calculated year by year LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification rates in six countries (the United States, China, India, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey) and then used data from the Green Building Information Gateway (GBIG) to estimate energy savings in each country each year. Of the green building rating schemes, LEED accounts for 32% of green-certified floor space and publically reports energy efficiency data. We employed Harvard\u2019s Co-BE Calculator to determine pollutant emissions reductions by country accounting for transient energy mixes and baseline energy use intensities. Co-BE applies the social cost of carbon and the social cost of atmospheric release to translate these reductions into health benefits. Based on modeled energy use, LEED-certified buildings saved $7.5B in energy costs and averted 33MT of CO2, 51\u2009kt of SO2, 38\u2009kt of NOx, and 10\u2009kt of PM2.5 from entering the atmosphere, which amounts to $5.8B (lower limit\u2009=\u2009$2.3B, upper limit\u2009=\u2009$9.1B) in climate and health co-benefits from 2000 to 2016 in the six countries investigated.

Because the climate and health benefits are nearly equivalent to the energy savings for green buildings in the United States, and up to 10 times higher in developing countries, they provide an important and previously unquantified societal value.

Here we analysed outputs of 13 Earth system models to show an increasingly stronger impact on GPP by extreme droughts than by mild and moderate droughts over the twenty-first century. Due to a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme droughts, the magnitude of globally averaged reductions in GPP associated with extreme droughts was projected to be nearly tripled by the last quarter of this century (2075\u20132099) relative to that of the historical period (1850\u20131999) under both high and intermediate GHG emission scenarios. By contrast, the magnitude of GPP reductions associated with mild and moderate droughts was not projected to increase substantially. Our analysis indicates a high risk of extreme droughts to the global carbon cycle with atmospheric warming; however, this risk can be potentially mitigated by positive anomalies of GPP associated with favourable environmental conditions.

Results indicate that the low-carbon energy policies, traditionally regarded as a primary result of climate mitigation, are likely driven more by the efforts on air quality attainment in China. To achieve air quality attainment in China could lead to more reduction in CO2 emissions than its Nationally Determined Contribution. In addition, stronger low-carbon policies will bring significant benefits to public health via improvements in air quality. This study also provides a valuable reference for other developing countries to address their duel challenges of climate change and air pollution. China is challenged with the simultaneous goals of improving air quality and mitigating climate change. The \u201cBeautiful China\u201d strategy, launched by the Chinese government in 2020, requires that all cities in China attain 35 \u03bcg/m3 or below for annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm) by 2035. Meanwhile, China adopts a portfolio of low-carbon policies to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledged in the Paris Agreement. Previous studies demonstrated the cobenefits to air pollution reduction from implementing low-carbon energy policies. Pathways for China to achieve dual targets of both air quality and CO2 mitigation, however, have not been comprehensively explored. Here, we couple an integrated assessment model and an air quality model to evaluate air quality in China through 2035 under the NDC scenario and an alternative scenario (Co-Benefit Energy [CBE]) with enhanced low-carbon policies. Results indicate that some Chinese cities cannot meet the PM2.5 target under the NDC scenario by 2035, even with the strictest end-of-pipe controls. Achieving the air quality target would require further reduction in emissions of multiple air pollutants by 6 to 32%, driving additional 22% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to the NDC scenario. Results show that the incremental health benefit from improved air quality of CBE exceeds 8 times the additional costs of CO2 mitigation, attributed particularly to the cost-effective reduction in household PM2.5 exposure.

Black carbon (BC), a distinct type of carbonaceous material formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil and biomass based fuels under certain conditions, can interact with solar radiation and clouds through its strong light-absorption ability, thereby warming the Earth's climate system. Some studies have even suggested that global warming could be slowed down in the short term by eliminating BC emission due to its short lifetime. In this study, we estimate the influence of removing some sources of BC and other co-emitted species on the aerosol radiative effect by using an aerosol\u2013climate atmosphere-only model BCC_AGCM2.0.1_CUACE/Aero with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice cover, in combination with the aerosol emissions from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. We find that the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) will be enhanced by 0.12 W m\u22122 compared with recent past year 2000 levels if the emissions of only BC are reduced to the level projected for 2100 based on the RCP2.6 scenario. This will be beneficial~for the mitigation of global warming. However, both aerosol negative direct and indirect radiative effects are weakened when BC and its co-emitted species (sulfur dioxide and organic carbon) are simultaneously reduced. Relative to year 2000 levels, the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the TOA will be weakened by 1.7\u20132.0 W m\u22122 if the emissions of all these aerosols are decreased to the levels projected for 2100 in different ways based on the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Because there are no effective ways to remove the BC exclusively without influencing the other co-emitted components, our results therefore indicate that a reduction in BC emission can lead to an unexpected warming on the Earth's climate system in the future.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0c35a3f690667284154b38c297bb7d21d63cffe9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796272810", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2017.0263", "CorpusId": 4854412, "PubMed": "29610375"}, "title": "The impact of Earth system feedbacks on carbon budgets and climate response", "abstract": "A number of studies have examined the size of the allowable global cumulative carbon budget compatible with limiting twenty-first century global average temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C and below 1.5\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels. These estimates of cumulative emissions have a number of uncertainties including those associated with the climate sensitivity and the global carbon cycle. Although the IPCC fifth assessment report contained information on a range of Earth system feedbacks, such as carbon released by thawing of permafrost or methane production by wetlands as a result of climate change, the impact of many of these Earth system processes on the allowable carbon budgets remains to be quantified. Here, we make initial estimates to show that the combined impact from typically unrepresented Earth system processes may be important for the achievability of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The size of the effects range up to around a 350\u2009GtCO2 budget reduction for a 1.5\u00b0C warming limit and around a 500 GtCO2 reduction for achieving a warming limit of 2\u00b0C.

Confronted with GHG emission reductions targets of 80\u201395% by 2050 and with some GHG emitting sectors confronted with great difficulties to reach such targets, such as agriculture, the power sector will need to reduce its GHG emissions virtually to zero. As nuclear energy involves very substantial accident risks and the unsolved problem of safe long\u2010term deposit of nuclear waste and as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has rather limited safe storage potentials at least in Europe, the question arises, whether it will be possible to supply 100% of all necessary electricity from renewable energy sources? We show that a fast expanding volume of analyses underlines the feasibility and reliability of 100% renewable electricity supply systems. This fast mounting evidence appears to mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in energy politics, as highly regarded national and international advisory bodies such as the IPCC or the German Council of Environmental Advisors start to adopt this perspective. The example of the highly publicized study of the German Council of Environmental Advisors shows how a 100% renewable electricity system for Germany, Europe, and North Africa could look in 2050 and how the transition toward such a system could be achieved. This study, conducted with major input from the authors, is used to show the major aspects of a 100% renewable electricity supply system, such as the security of supply in every hour of the year, the compensation of intermittent sources such as wind and solar PV energy by other renewables and expanded storage, and the necessary extension of national and international grid infrastructures.

This important international agreement followed about seven years of effort among governments, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and the scientific community, and is called REDD+, the program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. REDD+ could achieve its potential to slow emissions from deforestation and forest degradation either as a new market option to offset emissions from developed nations, or as a mitigation option for developing countries themselves. Aside from representing an important step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a growing list of potential co-benefits to REDD+ include improved forestry practices, forest restoration, sustainable development, and biodiversity protection. Indeed the agreement is heralded as a win\u2013win for climate change mitigation and tropical forest conservation, and it could end up contributing to a global economy based on carbon and ecosystem services. That's good news, and some governments are now working to become 'REDD ready' in preparation for the forthcoming international program. This is important because, according to the agreements made by governments in the UNFCCC, developing countries which voluntarily decide to take part in REDD+ must establish their own national forest monitoring system to report changes in emissions from forests (UNFCCC 2009). But as of today, no developing country has implemented a system for monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV) emission reductions for REDD+. Of course, it is all still very new, but many REDD-type projects have been underway for years now (Parker et al 2008), and many MRV practitioners involved in those projects are the same people being asked to help with government-led, national MRV programs. Yet going from the project scale to program readiness is a big step for all involved, and many are finding that it is not easy. Current barriers to national monitoring of forest carbon stocks and emissions range from technical to scientific, and from institutional to operational. In fact, a recent analysis suggested that about 3% of tropical countries currently have the capacity to monitor and report on changes in forest cover and carbon stocks (Herold 2009). But until now, the scientific and policy-development communities have had little quantitative information on exactly which aspects of national-scale monitoring are most uncertain, and how that uncertainty will affect REDD+ performance reporting. A new and remarkable study by Pelletier, Ramankutty and Potvin (2011) uses an integrated, spatially-explicit modeling technique to explore and quantify sources of uncertainty in carbon emissions mapping throughout the Republic of Panama. Their findings are sobering: deforestation rates would need to be reduced by a full 50% in Panama in order to be detectable above the statistical uncertainty caused by several current major monitoring problems. The number one uncertainty, accounting for a sum total of about 77% of the error, rests in the spatial variation of aboveground carbon stocks in primary forests, secondary forests and on fallow land. The poor quality of and insufficient time interval between land-cover maps account for the remainder of the overall uncertainty. These findings are a show-stopper for REDD+ under prevailing science and technology conditions. The Pelletier et al study highlights the pressing need to improve the accuracy of forest carbon and land cover mapping assessments in order for REDD+ to become viable, but how can the uncertainties be overcome? First, with REDD+ nations required to report their emissions, and with verification organizations wanting to check on the reported numbers, there is a clear need for shared measurement and monitoring approaches. One of the major stumbling blocks actually starts with the scientific community, which needs not only to develop highly accurate deforestation, degradation and carbon emission monitoring methods, but also to make those methods available to national governments and the supporting organizations orbiting those governments. This 'giving away' of the methods starts, but does not end, with the training provided by the scientific experts on the use of the monitoring tools. This effort must also involve a commitment to sustained support and capacity building until non-expert monitoring and reporting becomes routine. The scientific community must also make clear what is operational and what is research. Operational does not necessarily mean less accurate. Rather, achieving both operational status and high accuracy requires innovation. While an innovative, but one-time or infrequent, mapping of forest cover or carbon stocks has been the most common scientific contribution to REDD+, it alone does not constitute operational monitoring. However, it can contribute to a portfolio of techniques and products that must come together to form an operational monitoring and modeling approach. Australia's National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS; www.climatechange.gov.au/) is one such approach, and there are others developing (www.csr.ufmg.br/simamazonia/). Importantly, carbon accounting models can meet the REDD+ challenge, but only if the observations\u2014the measurements\u2014are high quality, high resolution, and synoptic in geographic scale (Asner 2009). Is there hope, and if so, is it based on real and present scientific progress? Real progress is being made, but much of the innovation has not landed in the reports provided by and for the UN and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Yet this innovation is breaking serious barriers that extend and/or replace traditional forest inventory techniques, that use the latest satellite and aircraft technology on a cost-effective and repeated basis, and which simultaneously produce non-expert users of those technologies. And some government and academic science organizations are making their previously expert-only deforestation monitoring software widely available. For example, the Carnegie Institution's CLASlite system routinely tracks deforestation and degradation, and is now in use by more than 150 organizations throughout nine countries (http://claslite.ciw.edu). Carbon stock and emissions mapping is also becoming routine, but still involves combined effort by government and expert science partners to get it right (http://geoservidor.minam.gob.pe/intro/). Data accessibility is also critically important, and a few countries, such as Brazil and the United States, are leading the way by providing satellite imagery essential to lowering the uncertainties documented by Pelletier et al (2011). Finally, the uncertainty in MRV may be addressed faster at the sub-national level. Developing states and provinces are often responsible for implementing forest policies and land-use zoning, and many have their own forest monitoring programs. Thirteen tropical states and provinces, from Mexico to Brazil and Indonesia, are forging ahead in developing their own jurisdiction-wide REDD+ programs in collaboration with the US State of California, which has created the world's first greenhouse gas emission cap-and-trade policy that allows international offsets. In fact, this collaboration may soon create the first regulated REDD+ carbon market as California (USA), Acre (Brazil) and Chiapas (Mexico) forge an historic linkage agreement under the auspices of the Governors' Climate and Forest Task Force (http://gcftaskforce.org). Once created, this REDD+ market, in which regulated California industries achieve a portion of their emissions reductions through investments in Acre and Chiapas REDD+ programs, could expand to include new buyers and new providers. A key component of this program involves highly accurate, operational MRV on both sides of the carbon trading table, and at these state-level geographic scales, the science and technology are proving to be the most robust and accurate. Scientific innovation, combined with appropriate up-scaling from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, will likely prove most effective in bringing REDD+ to fruition.

MICP is a widespread biochemical process in soils, caves, freshwater, marine sediments and hypersaline habitats. MICP is an outcome of metabolic interactions between diverse microbial communities with organic and/or inorganic compounds present in environment. Some of the major metabolic processes involved in MICP at different levels are urea hydrolysis, denitrification, dissimilatory sulfate reduction and photosynthesis. Currently, MICP directed by urea hydrolysis, denitrification and dissimilatory sulfate reduction has been reported to aid in development of bioconcrete and demonstrated improvement in mechanical and structural properties of concrete. Bioconcrete is a promising sustainable technology in reducing the negative environmental impacts due to CO2 emission from construction sector and as well as in terms of economic benefits by way of promoting self-healing process of the concrete structures. Among the metabolic processes mentioned above, urea hydrolysis is the most applied in concrete repair mechanisms. MICP by urea hydrolysis is induced by a series of reactions driven by urease (Ur) and carbonic anhydrase (CA). Catalytic activity of these two enzymes depends on diverse parameters, which are currently being studied under laboratory conditions to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved and their regulation in microorganisms.

It is imperative that the world looks towards a portfolio of carbon mitigation solutions, rather than a single strategy. In this regard, the use of CO2 as a C1 source is an attractive strategy as CO2 has the potential to be a great asset for the industrial sector and consumers across the globe. In particular, the reduction of CO2 offers an alternative to fossil fuels for various organic industrial feedstocks and fuels. Consequently, efficient and scalable approaches for the reduction of CO2 to products such as methane and methanol can generate value from its emissions. Accordingly, in recent years, metal-free catalysis has emerged as a sustainable approach because of the mild reaction conditions by which CO2 can be reduced to various value-added products. The metal-free catalytic reduction of CO2 offers the development of chemical processes with low cost, earth-abundant, non-toxic reagents, and low carbon-footprint.

The most serious differences were found in undiluted urine at the fluorescence emission wavelengths from 400 nm to 460 nm when excited at 310 - 390 nm.

When these mutants were propagated under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions (in darkness except for 15 min of weak light a day) for several weeks, essentially no chlorophyll was detectable but protochlorophyllide accumulated. Upon return of the chlL- mutant cultures to continuous light, within the first 6 h chlorophyll was synthesized at the expense of protochlorophyllide at a rate independent of the presence of photosystem I. Chlorophyll biosynthesized during this time gave rise to a 685 nm fluorescence emission peak at 77 K in intact cells. This peak most likely originates from a component different from those known to be directly associated with photosystems II and I. Development of 695 and 725 nm peaks (indicative of intact photosystem II and photosystem I, respectively) required longer exposures to light.

Measurements from the pilot boiler demonstrate the technical feasibility of the process for larger scale-boilers, highlighting the favorable impact on NOx, SOx and mercury emissions, while concentrating the carbon dioxide in the flue gas. The results also show a significant reduction in fly ash unburned combustible content resulting in improvement in boiler efficiency due to the use of oxygen. The paper concludes that oxygen enrichment represents a technically sound technology for multi-pollutant control. A consequent paper presented during this conference discusses the economical aspects related to the technology, indicating that oxygen enrichment is an attractive solution for ultra-clean coal-based power generation.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "6416926236a7e6331eaa877b5331e9c51618e894", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2278871722", "CorpusId": 202304}, "title": "Review of Research on Vehicles Aerodynamic Drag Reduction Methods", "abstract": "Recent spikes in fuel prices and concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions, automotive design engineers are faced with the immediate task of introducing more efficient aerodynamic designs vehicles. The aerodynamic drags of a road vehicle is responsible for a large part of the vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption and contribute up to 50% of the total vehicle fuel consumption at highway speeds. Review on the research performance of active and passive flow control on the vehicle aerodynamic drag reduction is reported in this paper. This review intends to provide information on the current approaches and their efficiency in reducing pressure drag of ground vehicles. The review mainly focuses on the methods employed to prevent or delay air flow separation at the rear end of vehicle. Researches carried out by a number of researchers with regard to active and passive flow controls method on vehicle and their effect on aerodynamic drag in terms of drag coefficient (CD) was highlighted. Passive methods i.e. Vortex Generator (VG), spoiler and splitter and active flow controls i.e. steady blowing, suction and air jet are among the methods had been reviewed. In addition several attempts to couple these flow control methods were also reviewed. Several aspects of aerodynamic drag that need for further investigation as to assist for vehicles aerodynamic design and for practical reasons were highlighted.

Patients Nine patients were recruited. Six patients had undergone cleft palate repair and subsequently developed VPI. Three were noncleft patients of which one had developed VPI after nasopharyngeal cancer treatment; another patient had developed VPI after combined adenotonsillectomy, and a third patient had VPI of unknown etiology. Main outcome measure Preoperative and 1-year postoperative MRIs were obtained during vocal rest and during phonation. Data measured were the velopharyngeal distance in the sagittal plane and the velopharyngeal gap area in the axial plane. Preoperative and 1-year postoperative audio recordings were blinded for scoring independently by three senior speech therapists. Results When comparing preoperative and 1-year postoperative MRI during phonation we found a significant reduction of the median velopharyngeal distance from 4 to 0 mm (p = .011), and a significant reduction of the median velopharyngeal gap area from 42 to 34 mm2 (p = .038). Nasal turbulence improved significantly (p = .011). Hypernasality/hyponasality and audible nasal emission did not change significantly. Conclusions Autologous fat transplantation to the velopharynx resulted in a significant reduction of the velopharyngeal distance and the velopharyngeal gap area during phonation, as measured by MRI. This was in accordance with a significant improvement in nasal turbulence. However, hypernasality and audible nasal emission did not change significantly and could not be correlated to the MRI findings.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b7aaf270b1f2dec9c3e0018e986dfedfc2134a36", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2291267454", "CorpusId": 18121723}, "title": "Optimal Allocati on of Distributed Generation in Distribution System for Loss Reduction", "abstract": "I ntegration of renewable energy based distributed generation (DG) units provides potential benefits to conventional distribution systems.

Recent studies have investigated the spatial patterns and temporal trends of nitrogen and sulfur wet deposition, but few studies have focused on dry deposition due to the scarcity of dry deposition measurements. Here, we use long-term model simulations from the coupled WRF-CMAQ model covering the period from 1990 to 2010 to study changes in spatial distribution as well as temporal trends in total (TDEP), wet (WDEP) and dry deposition (DDEP) of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and sulfur (TSO4). We first evaluate the model's performance in simulating WDEP over the U.S. by comparing the model results with observational data from the U.S. National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The coupled model generally underestimates the WDEP of both TIN (including both the oxidized nitrogen deposition-TNO3, and the reduced nitrogen deposition-NHX) and TSO4, with better performance in the eastern U.S. than the western U.S. TDEP of both TIN and TSO4 show significant decreases over the U.S., especially in the east due to the large emission reductions that occurred in that region. The decreasing trends of TIN TDEP are caused by decrease of TNO3, and the increasing trends of TIN deposition over the Great Plains and Tropical Wet Forests regions are caused by increases in NH3 emissions although it should be noted that these increasing trends are not significant. TIN WDEP shows decreasing trends throughout the U.S., except for the Marine West Coast Forest region. TIN DDEP shows significant decreasing trends in the region of Eastern Temperate Forests, Northern Forests, Mediterranean California and Marine West Coast Forest, and significant increasing trends in the region of Tropical Wet Forests, Great Plains and Southern Semi-arid Highlands. For the other three regions (North American Deserts, Temperate Sierras and Northwestern Forested Mountains), the decreasing or increasing trends were not significant. Both the WDEP and DDEP of TSOx have decreases across the U.S., with a larger decreasing trend in the DDEP than that in the WDEP. Across the U.S. during the 1990-2010 period, DDEP of TIN accounted for 58-65% of TDEP of TIN. TDEP of TIN over the U.S. was dominated by deposition of TNO3 during the first decade, which then shifts to reduced nitrogen (NHX) dominance after 2003 resulting from combination of NOx emission reductions and NH3 emission increases. The sulfur DDEP is usually higher than the sulfur WDEP until recent years, as the sulfur DDEP has a larger decreasing trend than WDEP.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "58a97f8bdfea7c7365a6433979ec5270852156c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171254887", "DOI": "10.1080/00036846.2012.659346", "CorpusId": 154387231}, "title": "Is there a case for carbon-based border tax adjustment? An applied general equilibrium analysis", "abstract": "Concern that unilateral Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions could foster carbon leakage and undermine the international competitiveness of domestic industry has led to growing calls for carbon-based Border-Tax Adjustments (BTAs). This article uses a global general equilibrium model to assess the economic effects of BTAs and comes to three main conclusions. First, BTAs can reduce carbon leakage if the coalition of countries taking action to reduce GHG emissions is small, because in this case leakage (while typically small) mainly occurs through international trade competitiveness losses rather than through declines in world fossil fuel prices. Second, even though the economic effects of BTAs vary somewhat depending on how they are implemented, their welfare impact is typically small, and slightly negative at the world level. Third, and perhaps more strikingly, BTAs do not necessarily curb the output losses incurred by the domestic Energy Intensive-Industries (EIIs) they are intended to protect in the first place. This is in part because EIIs in industrialized countries make important use of carbon-intensive intermediate inputs produced by EIIs in other geographical areas. Another, deeper explanation is that EIIs are ultimately more adversely affected by the existence of a carbon price itself than by any international competitiveness losses. These findings are shown to be robust to key model parameters, country coverage, targets and design features of BTAs.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "63560f1cd15db992bbc7b1d4a9bb09faebaf5309", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2965855398", "DOI": "10.4236/OJMS.2019.93012", "CorpusId": 201305185}, "title": "A Review and Economic Analysis of Different Emission Reduction Techniques for Marine Diesel Engines", "abstract": "The maritime industry is currently facing the challenges of adopting new technologies and operational practices with stricter international, national and local rules in order to reduce exhaust gas emissions from ships.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that spherical AgNPs dispersed on the surface and the interior of the fibers.
