Through mathematical models, an analysis is made on the emissions trading system under an emission reduction framework. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) The impact by environmental taxes on the existing firm\u2019s choices of optimal discharging amounts is uncertain, the existing firm\u2019s discharging amounts will decrease with the increased prices of emissions permits, and paid initial emissions allowances will reduce the existing firm\u2019s profits; (2) Under an intertemporal trading system, the existing firm\u2019s holding permits conforms to the principle of profit maximization; (3) Under the intertemporal trading system, the prices for emissions permits for the entrant firms are always on the rise and so are their access costs into the industries, thus frustrating local governments\u2019 efforts in attracting investments; and (4) Emissions reduction policy is a good regulatory measure for promoting local economic welfare and realizing sustainable development.

Here, we report carbon and hydrogen isotopic measurements of atmospheric methane in archived air samples collected 1977\u20131998, and modeling of these with more contemporary data to infer changes in methane sources over the period 1984\u20132009. We present strong evidence that methane emissions from fossil fuel sectors were approximately constant in the 1980s and 1990s but increased significantly between 2000 and 2009. This finding challenges recent conclusions based on atmospheric ethane that fugitive fossil fuel emissions fell during much of this period. Emissions from other anthropogenic sources also increased, but were partially offset by reductions in wetland and fire emissions. Observations of atmospheric methane (CH4) since the late 1970s and measurements of CH4 trapped in ice and snow reveal a meteoric rise in concentration during much of the twentieth century. Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (1984\u20132009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y\u22121 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance.

In order to assess measures for emission reductions and improved air quality, three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry transport modeling systems are used in numerous research institutions and public authorities. These models need accurate emission data in appropriate spatial and temporal resolution as input. This paper reviews the most widely used emission inventories on global and regional scales and looks into the methods used to make the inventory data model ready. Shortcomings of using standard temporal profiles for each emission sector are discussed, and new methods to improve the spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions are presented. These methods are often neither top-down nor bottom-up approaches but can be seen as hybrid methods that use detailed information about the emission process to derive spatially varying temporal emission profiles. These profiles are subsequently used to distribute bulk emissions such as national totals on appropriate grids. The wide area of natural emissions is also summarized, and the calculation methods are described. Almost all types of natural emissions depend on meteorological information, which is why they are highly variable in time and space and frequently calculated within the chemistry transport models themselves. The paper closes with an outlook for new ways to improve model ready emission data, for example, by using external databases about road traffic flow or satellite data to determine actual land use or leaf area. In a world where emission patterns change rapidly, it seems appropriate to use new types of statistical and observational data to create detailed emission data sets and keep emission inventories up-to-date. Implications: Emission data are probably the most important input for chemistry transport model (CTM) systems. They need to be provided in high spatial and temporal resolution and on a grid that is in agreement with the CTM grid. Simple methods to distribute the emissions in time and space need to be replaced by sophisticated emission models in order to improve the CTM results. New methods, e.g., for ammonia emissions, provide grid cell\u2013dependent temporal profiles. In the future, large data fields from traffic observations or satellite observations could be used for more detailed emission data.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "08c28cf2a1568762bc60a714a0f1a24388dfd69f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2620563565", "DOI": "10.1093/bja/aex098", "CorpusId": 3492775, "PubMed": "28505289"}, "title": "Financial and environmental costs of reusable and single-use anaesthetic equipment", "abstract": "Background.\nAn innovative approach to choosing hospital equipment is to consider the environmental costs in addition to other costs and benefits.\n\n\nMethods.\nWe used life cycle assessment to model the environmental and financial costs of different scenarios of replacing reusable anaesthetic equipment with single-use variants. The primary environmental costs were CO 2 emissions (in CO 2 equivalents) and water use (in litres). We compared energy source mixes between Australia, the UK/Europe, and the USA.\n\n\nResults.\nFor an Australian hospital with six operating rooms, the annual financial cost of converting from single-use equipment to reusable anaesthetic equipment would be an AUD$32\u2009033 (\u00a319\u2009220), 46% decrease.

Over the last decade the cost of compliance has fallen dramatically compared with most expectations, and today the total cost of the program is 40\u2013 140% lower than projections (depending on the timing of those projections and the counter-factual baseline considered). Marginal costs of reductions are less than one-half the cost considered in most analyses at the time the program was introduced.

Innovation under the SO2 allowance trading program involves organizational innovation at the firm, market and regulatory level and process innovation by electricity generators and upstream fuel suppliers. An important portion of the cost reductions that are evident was already in the works prior to and independent of the program. Nonetheless, the allowance trading program deserves significant credit for providing the incentive and flexibility to accelerate and to fully realize exogenous technical changes that were occurring in the industry. This marks a significant departure from conventional approaches to environmental regulation, which would not be expected to capture these savings.

Widespread PHEV adoption will depend upon technological and economic advances in batteries because the initial fuel savings do not rapidly compensate consumers for the capital costs of batteries today. For PHEV purchases to become economical to consumers, battery prices must decline from $1,300 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to about or below $500/kWh, or U.S. gasoline prices must remain at about $5 per gallon-or the federal government must institute policy innovations with equivalent effects, such as policies to lower battery cost and increase battery lifetimes (e.g. a broad and sustained program of battery RD&D), or those to widen the difference between gasoline and electricity prices (e.g. changes in energy taxes). However, even before PHEVs become cost-effective consumers, their purchase can still be highly valuable to society if their significant GHG reductions can be achieved cost-effectively (using a benchmark price of about $50/t-CO2-eq). Using the GREET model, we determine that in order for PHEVs' reductions to become cost-effective, either their purchase must approach current unsubsidized prices-requiring the same policy innovations described above-or very low-GHG electricity must be used to power them. This requires policies to decrease the GHG intensity of electricity, such as renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs or other measures.

The combustion behaviour and the engine performances, in terms of brake specific fuel consumption, were analysed. In addition, data on nitrogen oxides (NOx), total unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate emissions were collected. The injection strategy based on both early and pilot injections has been compared with the techniques using either pilot or early injections. Results show that, particularly at lower values of engine torque and speed, the small fuel quantity injected during early injection, coupled with the pilot injection, leads to comparable levels or even to a sensible reduction in fuel consumption compared with the only-pilot or only-early injection cases. Furthermore, a reduction in NOx and particulate is generally observed, while the level of unburned hydrocarbons usually increases. Experimental tests have shown that, using the early injection, a very lean premixed charge is obtained, both globally and locally, inside the combustion chamber, thus avoiding diesel problems (in particular, high NOx and soot production), mainly caused by the locally rich mixture.

The objective of this work is to investigate the possibility of decreasing exhaust emission with the lowest performance sacrifice. At part loads, a dual-fuelled engine inevitably suffers from lower thermal efficiency and higher carbon monoxide (CO) emission. This is mainly due to leaner mixture and incomplete combustion, which is a consequence of the smaller amount of pilot fuel. To resolve these problems, the e ects of cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) were investigated. The experimental results show that the application of EGR, at higher loads with 10 per cent EGR and at part loads with 15 per cent EGR, can considerably reduce NO x and other exhaust emissions such as unburned hydrocarbons, CO and soot.

For most policymakers, the most pressing problems associated with this increasing transport activity are traffic fatalities and injuries, congestion, air pollution and petroleum dependence. These problems are especially acute in the most rapidly growing economies of the developing world. Mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can take its place among these other transport priorities by emphasizing synergies and co-benefits (high agreement, much evidence). Transport predominantly relies on a single fossil resource, petroleum that supplies 95% of the total energy used by world transport. In 2004, transport was responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Over the past decade, transport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GHG emissions have increased at a faster rate than any other energy using sector (high agreement, much evidence). Transport activity will continue to increase in the future as economic growth fuels transport demand and the availability of transport drives development, by facilitating specialization and trade. The majority of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population still does not have access to personal vehicles and many do not have access to any form of motorized transport. However, this situation is rapidly changing. Freight transport has been growing even more rapidly than passenger transport and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Urban freight movements are predominantly by truck, while international freight is dominated by ocean shipping. The modal distribution of intercity freight varies greatly across regions. For example, in the United States, all modes participate substantially, while in Europe, trucking has a higher market share (in tkm1), compared to rail (high agreement, much evidence). Transport activity is expected to grow robustly over the next several decades. Unless there is a major shift away from current patterns of energy use, world transport energy use is projected to increase at the rate of about 2% per year, with the highest rates of growth in the emerging economies, and total transport energy use and carbon emissions is projected to be about 80% higher than current levels by 2030 (medium agreement, medium evidence). There is an ongoing debate about whether the world is nearing a peak in conventional oil production that will require a significant and rapid transition to alternative energy resources. There is no shortage of alternative energy sources, including oil sands, shale oil, coal-to-liquids, biofuels, electricity and hydrogen. Among these alternatives, unconventional fossil carbon resources would produce less expensive fuels mostcompatible with the existing transport infrastructure, but lead to increased carbon emissions (medium agreement, medium evidence). In 2004, the transport sector produced 6.3 GtCO2 emissions (23% of world energy-related CO2 emissions) and its growth rate is highest among the end-user sectors. Road transport currently accounts for 74% of total transport CO2 emissions. The share of non-OECD countries is 36% now and will increase rapidly to 46% by 2030 if current trends continue (high agreement, much evidence). The transport sector also contributes small amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions from fuel combustion and F-gases (fluorinated gases) from vehicle air conditioning. CH4 emissions are between 0.1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.3% of total transport GHG emissions, N2O between 2.0 and 2.8% (based on US, Japan and EU data only). Worldwide emissions of F-gases (CFC-12+HFC- 134a+HCFC-22) in 2003 were 0.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.6 GtCO2-eq, about 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10% of total transport CO2 emissions (medium agreement, limited evidence). When assessing mitigation options it is important to consider their lifecycle GHG impacts. This is especially true for choices among alternative fuels but also applies to a lesser degree to the manufacturing processes and materials composition of advanced technologies. Electricity and hydrogen can offer the opportunity to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcde-carbonise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the transport energy system although the actual full cycle carbon reduction depends upon the way electricity and hydrogen are produced. Assessment of mitigation potential in the transport sector through the year 2030 is uncertain because the potential depends on: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 World oil supply and its impact on fuel prices and the economic viability of alternative transport fuels; \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 R&D outcomes in several areas, especially biomass fuel production technology and its sustainability in massive scale, as well as battery longevity, cost and specific energy. Another problem for a credible assessment is the limited number and scope of available studies of mitigation potential and cost. Improving energy efficiency offers an excellent opportunity for transport GHG mitigation through 2030. Carbon emissions from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 light-duty road vehicles could be reduced by up to 50% by 2030 compared to currently produced models, assuming continued technological advances and strong policies to ensure that technologies are applied to increasing fuel economy rather than spent on increased horsepower and vehicle mass. Material substitution and advanced design could reduce the weight of light-duty vehicles by 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30%. Since the TAR (Third Assessment Report), energy efficiency of road vehicles has improved by the market success of cleaner directinjection turbocharged (TDI) diesels and the continued market penetration of numerous incremental efficiency technologies. Hybrid vehicles have also played a role, though their market penetration is currently small. Reductions in drag coefficients of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50% seem achievable for heavy intercity trucks, with consequent reductions in fuel use of 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20%. Hybrid technology is applicable to trucks and buses that operate in urban environments, and the diesel engine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency may be improved by 10% or more. Prospects for mitigation are strongly dependent on the advancement of transport technologies. There are also important opportunities to increase the operating efficiencies of transport vehicles. Road vehicle efficiency might be improved by 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20% through strategies such as eco-driving styles, increased load factors, improved maintenance, in-vehicle technological aids, more efficient replacement tyres, reduced idling and better traffic management and route choice (medium agreement, medium evidence). The total mitigation potential in 2030 of the energy efficiency options applied to light duty vehicles would be around 0.7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.8 GtCO2-eq in 2030 at costs", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "135131943152b9fa1edbf92a55e1eb237c19919d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2010473777", "DOI": "10.1007/s10705-008-9246-3", "CorpusId": 25080038}, "title": "Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy soil as influenced by timing of application of hydroquinone and dicyandiamide", "abstract": "A pot trial and a field experiment were conducted to study the effect of timing of application of nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on N2O and CH4 emissions from rice paddy soil.

In the present work, the emission characteristics of HVO fuel in a light-duty Euro 5 diesel engine have been studied, under steady-state operation, as well as during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The study was expanded to the investigation of exhaust emissions under modified Main Injection Timing (MIT) and EGR rate. The NEXBTL fuel, produced by Neste, was considered in the study and was compared with conventional market diesel. Emissions of nitric oxides (NOx), soot, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrocarbons (HC) were studied. At default MIT and EGR settings the use of HVO resulted in a significant reduction of all regulated emissions. In addition, it was observed that the adjustment of MIT and EGR can enhance the exploitation of HVO potential for emissions reduction, highlighting the differences with the conventional diesel fuel.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f21f50645077a366bfbd62b5cb43a984947af22d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "844205684", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2015.05.012", "CorpusId": 106974087}, "title": "The importance of grid integration for achievable greenhouse gas emissions reductions from alternative vehicle technologies", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6d8b21dfd8e133f785d6a243fe16f82f3f7a3d71", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2036449828", "DOI": "10.1103/PHYSREVB.29.5491", "CorpusId": 121408470}, "title": "Autoionization emission by electron impact in the 3d transition-metal series /sub 21/Sc to /sub 29/Cu", "abstract": "Autoionization emission associated with direct recombination of the resonant 3p..-->..3d transitions have been examined for all the 3d transition-metal elements from /sub 21/Sc to /sub 29/Cu.

Firstly, the intensity of this emission decreases with increasing Z. Secondly, the separation of the emission peak from the 3p threshold is large (approx.10 eV) toward the beginning of the series (/sub 21/Sc through /sub 24/Cr) and abruptly drops to a few electron volts near the middle of the series (/sub 25/Mn, /sub 26/Fe).

To implement OPERA, first, sensitivities of air quality to precursor emission changes are quantified.

The results of the OPERA calculations show that reductions in regional NOx and VOC as well as local primary PM2.5 emissions were more cost-effective than SO2 controls for decreasing ozone and total PM2.5 concentrations in the summer of 2007.

The technology of atmospheric plasma (ionized gas), widely used in material processing, offers one of the most significant breakthroughs in food and agri-material processing. This technology allows for the generation of bactericidal molecules very efficiently with low power requirements. Non-thermal atmospheric plasma has been used to effectively decontaminate surfaces, but it has received limited investigation for in-package decontamination. This study demonstrates the potential for in-package plasma treatment of model liquids within sealed packages. The advantage of in-package cold plasma treatment is that the bactericidal molecules are generated and contained in the package, allowing extended exposure to bacteria while reverting back to the original package gas within 24 h storage. This study treated liquid food surrogates containing bacteria and oxidation sensitive dye (methylene blue) inside sealed packages. The surrogates were placed in 96-well plates and were packaged in air and exposed directly and indirectly to the plasma field in a 2.2 cm high A\u2014 23 cm A\u2014 31 cm sealed polypropylene container for up to 5 min. Treatments were carried out using a prototype dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) operating at a voltage of 40 kV and frequency of 50 Hz. The UV-Vis emission spectra of the plasma revealed emission bands for nitrogen and oxygen species, including strong emission lines for excited states of the atomic species O, O + , N, and N + . The results from the evaluation of methylene blue suggest that direct exposure to the plasma ionization field produced a greater oxidative effect compared to indirect exposure. For 5 min treatment, direct exposure of methylene blue resulted in a 90% reduction in absorbance, and indirect exposure of methylene blue resulted in a 75% reduction in absorbance. These reductions may result from conversion of ozone into hydroxyl radicals, which reduces the methylene blue from dark blue color to clear. This process is irreversible. Additionally, bacterial studies examining treatment of E. coli ATCC 25922 suspended in maximum recovery diluent in 96-well plates found a 7 log 10 reduction after 50 s treatment and 24 h storage for both direct and indirect plasma exposure.

The increase in emission of sulphur oxides and nitrogen (both oxidised and reduced forms) since the mid-1800s caused a severe decline in pH and ANC in acid-sensitive surface waters across Europe. Since c.1980, these emissions have declined and trends towards recovery from acidification have been widely observed in time-series of water chemistry data. In this paper, the MAGIC model was applied to 10 regions (the SMART model to one) in Europe to address the question of future recovery under the most recently agreed emission protocols (the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol). The models were calibrated using best available data and driven using S and N deposition sequences for Europe derived from EMEP data. The wide extent and the severity of water acidification in 1980 in many regions were illustrated by model simulations which showed significant deterioration in ANC away from the pre-acidification conditions. The simulations also captured the recovery to 2000 in response to the existing emission reductions. Predictions to 2016 indicated further significant recovery towards pre-acidification chemistry in all regions except Central England (S Pennines), S Alps, S Norway and S Sweden. In these areas it is clear that further emission reductions will be required and that the recovery of surface waters will take several decades as soils slowly replenish their depleted base cation pools. Chemical recovery may not, however, ensure biological recovery and further reductions may also be required to enable these waters to achieve the \"good ecological status\" as required by the EU Water Framework Directive.

Thus, one of the focuses of recent research in animal science has been to develop or improve existing methane prediction models in order to increase overall understanding of the system and to evaluate mitigation strategies for methane reduction. Several dynamic mechanistic models of rumen function have been developed which contain hydrogen gas balance sub-models from which methane production can be predicted. These models predict methane production with varying levels of success and in many cases could benefit from further development. Central to methane prediction is accurate volatile fatty acid prediction, representation of the competition for substrate usage within the rumen, as well as descriptions of protozoal dynamics and pH.

An electrostatic space charge system (ESCS) was designed to reduce airborne dust and ammonia emissions from a commercial broiler production house. The ESCS for this application was based on patented technology developed to reduce airborne dust and pathogens. Two commercial broiler houses with built-up litter (a control house and one outfitted with an ESCS unit) were monitored for dust and ammonia concentrations over a period of 7 flocks. Results of this study indicate the ESCS significantly reduced airborne dust by an average of 43% and reduced ammonia by an average of 13%.

The model is exemplarily applied for the analysis of capital subsidies on the application of technologies using renewable energy sources. Quantitative results highlight that subsidies on these technologies do not automatically lead to a significant reduction in emissions. Moreover, if emission reductions are achieved these might actually partly result from negative growth effects induced by the promotion of cost inefficient technologies.

It has set clear targets for emission reductions consistent with international goals of limiting global warming and has pioneered statutory underpinning of target-setting. On the international stage, it has been an active protagonist of a global deal to limit human-induced climate change. The new Government has endorsed the direction of previous policies in this area and is introducing further measures, despite heavy fiscal pressures. The United Kingdom is likely to reduce emissions by more than its near-term domestic targets and its target under the Kyoto Protocol, outperforming many OECD countries in the latter respect. But some of the success has been due to \u2018one-off\u2019 factors such as the \u2018dash for gas\u2019, reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the 1990s and the recent recession, rather than explicit climate-change policies. The pace of decarbonisation of the power sector has been slow and the spread of renewable energy technologies limited. Implicit carbon prices vary across sectors, and should be harmonized to increase the cost efficiency of policy. The unevenness partly reflects the way in which policies have proliferated and overlap and a simplified structure would be desirable. A step\u2013change in the pace of emission reductions is required to put the UK on the path towards its ambitious 2050 target. Given the central role of the EU emissions trading scheme, a key element of the UK strategy should be to seek tighter quotas within the EU scheme. Preparations to adapt to climate impacts also need to be stepped up, focusing on the provision of more information, better risk-assessment frameworks and more advanced metrics for monitoring and evaluation of adaptation planning.

Il s\u2019est fixe des objectifs precis de reduction des emissions, coherents avec les objectifs internationaux de limitation du rechauffement planetaire, et a fait oeuvre de precurseur en les adossant a un socle reglementaire. Sur la scene internationale, il a joue un role actif en faveur d\u2019un accord mondial visant a limiter le changement climatique d\u2019origine anthropique. Le nouveau gouvernement a repris a son compte les orientations des politiques anterieures dans ce domaine et il introduit actuellement de nouvelles mesures, malgre la rigueur des contraintes budgetaires. Le Royaume-Uni devrait atteindre un taux de reduction de ses emissions superieur a celui de ses objectifs nationaux a court terme et de son objectif au titre du Protocole de Kyoto, et meme depasser nombre de pays de l\u2019OCDE quant a la realisation de ce dernier objectif. Mais une partie de ce succes s\u2019explique, non par des mesures explicites de politique climatique, mais par des facteurs ponctuels comme la \u00ab ruee vers le gaz \u00bb et les reductions des emissions d\u2019autres gaz a effet de serre que le CO2 dans les annees 90 et la recession recente. Le rythme de decarbonisation du secteur de l\u2019electricite a ete lent et la diffusion des technologies des energies renouvelables est encore limitee. Les prix implicites du carbone varient selon les secteurs et devraient etre harmonises pour une meilleure efficacite economique. Ces disparites refletent la proliferation des mesures et leur chevauchement et il serait necessaire d\u2019en simplifier la structure.

Methane emission rates measured by closed chamber method decreased significantly with increasing levels of silicate fertilizer application during rice cultivation. Soil redox potential (Eh) decreased rapidly after flooding, but floodwater pH and soil pH increased significantly with increasing levels of silicate fertilizer application. Iron concentrations in potted soils and in percolated water significantly increased with the increasing levels of silicate fertilizer application, which acted as oxidizing agents and electron acceptors, and thereby suppressed CH4 emissions. Silicate fertilization significantly decreased CH4 production activity, while it increased carbon dioxide (CO2) production activity. Rice plant growth, yield parameters, and grain yield were positively influenced by silicate application levels. The maximum increase in grain yield (17% yield increase over the control) was found with 10\u00a0Mg ha\u22121 silicate application along with 28% reduction in total CH4 flux during rice cultivation.

Three scenarios are developed: baseline, in which no smart grid rollout is assumed; feasible, based on what could be achievable in the light of technology developments and with supportive legislation; and an intermediate expected scenario, in which new technologies are introduced but nothing else changes. The findings indicate the potential for emissions reductions by 2020.

A smaller series of [(dfppy)2 Ir(LL')] (dfppy = N,C(2')-2-(4',6'-difluorophenyl)pyridyl) complexes were also examined along with two previously reported compounds, (ppy)2 Ir(CN)2- and (ppy)2 Ir(NCS)2- (ppy = N,C(2')-2-phenylpyridyl). The (tpy)2 Ir(PPh2CH2)2 BPh2 and [(tpy)2 Ir(CN-t-Bu)2](CF3SO3) complexes have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The Ir-C(aryl) bond lengths in (tpy)2 Ir(CN-t-Bu)2+ (2.047(5) and 2.072(5) A) and (tpy)2 Ir(PPh2CH2)2 BPh2 (2.047(9) and 2.057(9) A) are longer than their counterparts in (tpy)2 Ir(acac) (1.982(6) and 1.985(7) A). Density functional theory calculations carried out on (ppy)2 Ir(CN-Me)2+ show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) consists of a mixture of phenyl-pi and Ir-d orbitals, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is localized primarily on the pyridyl-pi orbitals. Electrochemical analysis of the (tpy)2 Ir(LL') complexes shows that the reduction potentials are largely unaffected by variation in the ancillary ligand, whereas the oxidation potentials vary over a much wider range (as much as 400 mV between two different LL' ligands). Spectroscopic analysis of the cyclometalated Ir complexes reveals that the lowest energy excited state (T1) is a triplet ligand-centered state (3LC) on the cyclometalating ligand admixed with 1MLCT (MLCT = metal-to-ligand charge-transfer) character. The different ancillary ligands alter the 1MLCT state energy mainly by changing the HOMO energy. Destabilization of the 1MLCT state results in less 1MLCT character mixed into the T1 state, which in turn leads to an increase in the emission energy. The increase in emission energy leads to a linear decrease in ln(k(nr)) (k(nr) = nonradiative decay rate). Decreased 1MLCT character in the T1 state also increases the Huang-Rhys factors in the emission spectra, decreases the extinction coefficient of the T1 transition, and consequently decreases the radiative decay rates (k(r)). Overall, the luminescence quantum yields decline with increasing emission energies. A linear dependence of the radiative decay rate (k(r)) or extinction coefficient (epsilon) on (1/deltaE)2 has been demonstrated, where deltaE is the energy difference between the 1MLCT and 3LC transitions. A value of 200 cm(-1) for the spin-orbital coupling matrix element 3LC absolute value(H(SO)) 1MLCT of the (tpy)2 Ir(LL') complexes can be deduced from this linear relationship.

Results from eight studies carried out in Spain under rainfed agriculture to investigate the effects of no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage (RT) compared with conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon (SOC) were used. For current land surface under conservation tillage, NT and RT are sequestering 0.14 and 0.08 Tg C yr \u20101 , respectively. Those rates represent 1.1% and 0.6% of the total CO2 emissions generated from agricultural activities in Spain during 2006. Alternatively, in a hypothetical scenario where all the arable dryland was under either NT or RT management, SOC sequestration would be 2.18 and 0.72 Tg C yr \u20101 representing 17.4% and 5.8% of the total 2006 CO2 equivalent emissions generated from the agricultural sector in Spain. This is a significant estimate that would help to achieve GHG emissions targets for the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

Applying the energy storage devices in Metro systems has a similar effect as in case of LRVs. However the savings distribution in the whole system will be a little bit different. Due to higher regeneration capability of metro systems the expected share of the train propulsion saving will be lower. It will be compensated by a considerable reduction of the line losses, especially for systems with low rated catenary voltages (600 V or 750 V). Very promising are energy storage applications in propulsion systems of diesel-electrical multiple units (DEMUs). These vehicles lack possibilities to use the braking energy of the train.

At the beginning of 2009 new space-borne observations of dry-air column-averaged mole fractions of atmospheric methane (XCH4) became available from the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observations\u2013Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) instrument on board the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Until April 2012 concurrent {methane (CH4) retrievals} were provided by the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) instrument on board the ENVironmental SATellite (ENVISAT). The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrievals can be compared during the period of overlap. We estimate monthly average CH4 emissions between January 2010 and December 2011, using the TM5-4DVAR inverse modelling system. In addition to satellite data, high-accuracy measurements from the Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA ESRL) are used, providing strong constraints on the remote surface atmosphere. We discuss five inversion scenarios that make use of different GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrieval products, including two sets of GOSAT proxy retrievals processed independently by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON)/Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and the University of Leicester (UL), and the RemoTeC \"Full-Physics\" (FP) XCH4 retrievals available from SRON/KIT. The GOSAT-based inversions show significant reductions in the root mean square (rms) difference between retrieved and modelled XCH4, and require much smaller bias corrections compared to the inversion using SCIAMACHY retrievals, reflecting the higher precision and relative accuracy of the GOSAT XCH4. Despite the large differences between the GOSAT and SCIAMACHY retrievals, 2-year average emission maps show overall good agreement among all satellite-based inversions, with consistent flux adjustment patterns, particularly across equatorial Africa and North America. Over North America, the satellite inversions result in a significant redistribution of CH4 emissions from North-East to South-Central United States. This result is consistent with recent independent studies suggesting a systematic underestimation of CH4 emissions from North American fossil fuel sources in bottom-up inventories, likely related to natural gas production facilities. Furthermore, all four satellite inversions yield lower CH4 fluxes across the Congo basin compared to the NOAA-only scenario, but higher emissions across tropical East Africa. The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY inversions show similar performance when validated against independent shipboard and aircraft observations, and XCH4 retrievals available from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e3ff6413a58c8e992960f91adc95ab1dbb565348", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2066244328", "DBLP": "journals/jsac/GattulliTFP14", "DOI": "10.1109/JSAC.2014.140104", "CorpusId": 902356}, "title": "Low-Emissions Routing for Cloud Computing in IP-over-WDM Networks with Data Centers", "abstract": "Cloud Computing (CC) services are rapidly catching on as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. As cloud computing adoption increases, the energy consumption of the network and of the computing resources that underpin the cloud is growing and causing the emission of enormous quantities of CO2. Research is now focusing on novel \"low-carbon\" cloud-computing solutions. Renewable energy sources are emerging as a promising solution both to achieve drastic reduction in CO2 emissions and to cope with the growing power requirements of data centers. These infrastructures can be located near renewable energy plants and data can be effectively transferred to these locations via reconfigurable optical networks, based on the principle that data can be moved more efficiently than electricity. This paper focuses on how to dynamically route on-demand optical circuits that are established to transfer energy-intensive data processing towards data centers powered with renewable energy. Our main contribution consists in devising two routing algorithms for connections supporting CC services, aimed at minimizing the CO2 emissions of data centers by following the current availability of renewable energies (e.g., coming from sun and wind). The trade-off with energy consumption for the transport equipments is considered. We also compare three different IP-over-WDM network architectures. The results show that relevant reductions, up to about 30% in CO2 emissions can be achieved using our approaches compared to baseline shortest-path-based routing strategies, paying off only a marginal increase in terms of network blocking probability.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "7e5c7b51af0e6c9bb36b9f63c7261d22276acc41", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2188767967", "CorpusId": 220995528}, "title": "Health and Climate Change 2 Public health benefi ts of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: urban land transport", "abstract": "We used Comparative Risk Assessment methods to estimate the health e\ufb00 ects of alternative urban land transport scenarios for two settings\u2014London, UK, and Delhi, India.

Heterogeneous ice nuclei such as mineral dust, metallic, and soot particles, and some crys- talline solids within partially soluble aerosols are suspected to modulate cirrus properties. Among those, the role of ubiquitous soot particles is perhaps the least understood. Be- cause aviation is a major source of upper tropospheric soot particles, we put emphasis on ice formation in dispersing air- craft plumes. The effect of aircraft soot on cirrus formation in the absence of contrails is highly complex and depends on a wide array of emission and environmental parameters. We use a microphysical-chemical model predicting the for- mation of internally mixed, soot-containing particles up to two days after emission, and suggest two principal scenarios: high concentrations of original soot emissions could slightly increase the number of ice crystals; low concentrations of particles originating from coagulation of emitted soot with background aerosols could lead to a significant reduction in ice crystal number. Both scenarios assume soot particles to be moderate ice nuclei relative to cirrus formation by homo- geneous freezing in the presence of few efficient dust ice nu- clei. A critical discussion of laboratory experiments reveals that the ice nucleation efficiency of soot particles depends strongly on their source, and, by inference, on atmospheric aging processes. Mass and chemistry of soluble surface coat- ings appear to be crucial factors. Immersed soot particles tend to be poor ice nuclei, some bare ones nucleate ice at low supersaturations. However, a fundamental understand- ing of these studies is lacking, rendering extrapolations to atmospheric conditions speculative. In particular, we can- not yet decide which indirect aircraft effect scenario is more plausible, and options suggested to mitigate the problem re- main uncertain.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "dc0edf5967b922250004d066af35b05202b7251a", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7935357", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.abf7133", "CorpusId": 232124756, "PubMed": "33674320"}, "title": "Quantifying the influence of short-term emission reductions on climate", "abstract": "Emission reductions associated with pandemic containment are nowhere close to affecting climate and reducing global warming. The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has resulted in a marked slowdown in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. Although the resulting emission reductions will continue to evolve, this will presumably be temporary. Here, we provide estimates of the potential effect of such short-term emission reductions on global and regional temperature and precipitation by analyzing the response of an Earth System Model to a range of idealized near-term emission pathways not considered in available model intercomparison projects. These estimates reveal the modest impact that temporary emission reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will have on global and regional climate. Our simulations suggest that the impact of carbon dioxide and aerosol emission reductions is actually a temporary enhancement in warming rate.

The occurrence of PAHs was mainly derived from various combustion sources, especially the combustion of biomass and domestic coal. Uniform composition of sedimentary PAHs (52-62% of phenanthrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene) suggested air-borne mixtures intractable to degradation. The concentrations of the sum of 15 PAHs (16 priority pollutants designed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency minus naphthalene; designed as \u03a3(15)PAH) in Yellow Sea sediment cores were generally higher than those in the South China Sea. The profiles of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations recorded in the sediment cores closely followed historical socioeconomic development in China. In general, \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations started to increase from the background pollution level posed by agricultural economy at the turn of 20th century. In addition, a \u03a3(15)PAH concentration reduction was observed during the Chinese Civil War (1946-1949) and Great Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), suggesting them as setbacks for economic development in Chinese history. Increasing PAH emissions as a result of increasing coal combustion associated with the rapid urbanization and industrialization since the implementation of the Reform and Open Policy (since 1978) accounted for the fast growth of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations in sediment cores. The decline of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations from subsurface maximum until sampling time was inconsistent with current-day economic development in China, and may possibly suggest emission reductions due to decreasing proportional use of domestic coal and increasing consumption of cleaner energies (natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "fb13c516c860abf24b0149a2313448f2982a37f8", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/anor/YangADYL19", "MAG": "2765757312", "DOI": "10.1007/S10479-017-2682-1", "CorpusId": 125401113}, "title": "Carbon emission allocation in China based on gradually efficiency improvement and emission reduction planning principle", "abstract": "Carbon emission allocation in China is one of the most important research fields in recent years.

In this study, we proposed an alternative approach based on gradually efficiency improvement planning and emission reduction planning principles. Based on them, the efficiency is planning to be steadily improved after allocating carbon emission year by year rather than achieve the maximized target (efficient) in a single step or maintain the original efficiency without any improvement. Meanwhile, the total carbon emission is also planning to be reduced by a certain percent according to the promise by China in Copenhagen climate conference.

The decoupling combustion refers to a two-step combustion method, in which fuel pyrolysis and the burning of char and pyrolysis gas are separated and the gas burns out during its passage through the burning-char bed. Tests in a quartz dual-bed reactor demonstrated that, in decoupling combustion, NO emissions from biomass and biomass-coal blends were both less than those in traditional combustion and that NO emission from combustion of blends of biomass and coal decreased with increasing biomass percentage in the blend. Co-firing rice husk and coal in a 10 kW stove manufactured according to the decoupling combustion technology further confirmed that the decoupling combustion technology allows for truly low NO emission as well as high efficiency for burning biomass and biomass-coal blends, even in small-scale stoves and boilers.", "year": 2009}]}
