The existence of an interim period between setting and implementing environmental goals is ubiquitous in environmental policymaking. The existence of this interim period gives rise to several potential rationales for early emissions reductions. In this paper we use a series of simple models and numerical illustrations to analyze some aspects of the performance of early emissions reduction programs in the case of GHGs. We show that there is a compelling economic case for allowing early GHGs reduction credits if countries (not just individual firms) could bank early credits to offset future emissions. The annualized cost savings to the United States from spreading out abatement over time could easily amount to several billion dollars. But without the aggregate banking provision, such credits could easily generate an excessive amount of abatement and produce net economic losses. We analyze a number of other issues that affect the economic efficiency of early reduction credits, including asymmetric information, learning-by-doing (LBD), and fiscal impacts. We also compare the performance of an early reduction credits program with that of an early cap-and-trade program.

Emphasis was put on deriving realistic site-specific scenarios for the model applications. The deposition was calculated with EMEP transfer matrices and official emissions for the target years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The alternatives for S deposition were current reduction plans and maximum feasible reductions. For N, the NOx and NHy depositions were frozen at the present level.

We use a chemical transport model to examine the change of sulfate-nitrate-ammonium (SNA) aerosols over China due to anthropogenic emission changes of their precursors (SO2, NOx and NH3) from 2000 to 2015. From 2000 to 2006, annual mean SNA concentrations increased by about 60% over China as a result of the 60% and 80% increases in SO2 and NOx emissions. During this period, sulfate is the dominant component of SNA over South China (SC) and Sichuan Basin (SCB), while nitrate and sulfate contribute equally over North China (NC). Based on emission reduction targets in the 12th (2011\u20132015) Five-Year Plan (FYP), China's total SO2 and NOx emissions are projected to change by \u221216% and +16% from 2006 to 2015, respectively. The amount of NH3 emissions in 2015 is uncertain, given the lack of sufficient information on the past and present levels of NH3 emissions in China. With no change in NH3 emissions, SNA mass concentrations in 2015 will decrease over SCB and SC compared to their 2006 levels, but increase over NC where the magnitude of nitrate increase exceeds that of sulfate reduction. This suggests that the SO2 emission reduction target set by the 12th FYP, although effective in reducing SNA over SC and SCB, will not be successful over NC, for which NOx emission control needs to be strengthened. If NH3 emissions are allowed to keep their recent growth rate and increase by +16% from 2006 to 2015, the benefit of SO2 reduction will be completely offset over all of China due to the significant increase of nitrate, demonstrating the critical role of NH3 in regulating nitrate. The effective strategy to control SNA and hence PM2.5 pollution over China should thus be based on improving understanding of current NH3 emissions and putting more emphasis on controlling NH3 emissions in the future.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3b77cff15c050528824721cd33addeeaf53ab401", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2791031334", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/AAB89C", "CorpusId": 53683162}, "title": "Increased importance of methane reduction for a 1.5 degree target", "abstract": "To understand the importance of methane on the levels of carbon emission reductions required to achieve temperature goals, a processed-based approach is necessary rather than reliance on the transient climate response to emissions. We show that plausible levels of methane (CH4) mitigation can make a substantial difference to the feasibility of achieving the Paris climate targets through increasing the allowable carbon emissions. This benefit is enhanced by the indirect effects of CH4 on ozone (O3). Here the differing effects of CH4 and CO2 on land carbon storage, including the effects of surface O3, lead to an additional increase in the allowable carbon emissions with CH4 mitigation. We find a simple robust relationship between the change in the 2100 CH4 concentration and the extra allowable cumulative carbon emissions between now and 2100 (0.27 \u00b1 0.05 GtC per ppb CH4). This relationship is independent of modelled climate sensitivity and precise temperature target, although later mitigation of CH4 reduces its value and thus methane reduction effectiveness. Up to 12% of this increase in allowable emissions is due to the effect of surface ozone.

We identify that double issuance \u2013 the issuance of two units for the same reductions \u2013 and double claiming \u2013 the accounting of the same reductions both in a greenhouse gas inventory and in units towards attaining a mitigation pledge \u2013 are the most important forms of double counting.

While international agreement on principles for accounting and mechanism design is crucial to preventing double counting, the governance arrangements for implementation and international oversight could vary.

Intervention Adoption of diets optimised to achieve the WHO nutritional recommendations and reduce GHG emissions while remaining as close as possible to existing dietary patterns. Main outcome Changes in years of life lost due to coronary heart disease, stroke, several cancers and type II diabetes, quantified using life tables. Results If the average UK dietary intake were optimised to comply with the WHO recommendations, we estimate an incidental reduction of 17% in GHG emissions. Such a dietary pattern would be broadly similar to the current UK average. Our model suggests that it would save almost 7 million years of life lost prematurely in the UK over the next 30\u2005years and increase average life expectancy by over 8\u2005months.

Conclusions There are large potential benefits to health from adopting diets with lower associated GHG emissions in the UK.

When the extra N2O emission from biofuel production is calculated in \"CO2-equivalent\" global warm- ing terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of \"saving\" emissions of fossil fuel derived CO2, the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as much or more to global warming by N2O emis- sions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate impacts. This analysis only consid- ers the conversion of biomass to biofuel. It does not take into account the use of fossil fuel on the farms and for fertil- izer and pesticide production, but it also neglects the produc- tion of useful co-products. Both factors partially compensate each other.

The marginal abatement cost to achieve these emission reductions reaches $150/tCO2-eq in 2020 and $600/tCO2-eq in 2050. Renewable energy, fuel switching, and efficiency improvement in power generation account for 45\u00a0% of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. Non-energy sectors, namely, fugitive emission, waste management, agriculture, and F-gases, account for 25\u00a0% of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation, and biofuel together account for 64\u00a0% of the total GHG emission reduction in 2050. Additional investment in GHG abatement technologies for achieving the target reaches US$ 6.0 trillion by 2020 and US$ 73 trillion by 2050. This corresponds to 0.7 and 1.8\u00a0% of the world GDP, respectively, in the same periods. Non-Annex I regions account for 55\u00a0% of the total additional investment by 2050. In a sectoral breakdown, the power generation and transport sectors account for 56 and 30\u00a0% of the total additional investment by 2050, respectively.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "90c031169d51991e0b0bd0e4c7c26b0f5bf75ded", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164078670", "DOI": "10.1111/jiec.12053", "CorpusId": 33453163}, "title": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Opportunities for Concrete Pavements", "abstract": "Concrete pavements are a vital part of the transportation infrastructure, comprising nearly 25% of the interstate network in the United States.

The International Maritime Organization is currently working to establish GHG regulations for international shipping and a cost effectiveness approach has been suggested to determine the required emission reductions from shipping. To achieve emission reductions in a cost effective manner, this study has assessed the cost and reduction potential for present and future abatement measures based on new and unpublished data. The model used captures the world fleet up to 2030, and the analysis includes 25 separate measures. A new integrated modelling approach has been used combining fleet projections with activity-based CO2 emission modelling and projected development of measures for CO2 emission reduction. The world fleet projections up to 2030 are constructed using a fleet growth model that takes into account assumed ship type specific scrapping and new building rates. A baseline trajectory for CO2 emission is then established. The reduction potential from the baseline trajectory and the associated marginal cost levels are calculated for 25 different emission reduction measures. The results are given as marginal abatement cost curves, and as future cost scenarios for reduction of world fleet CO2 emissions. The results show that a scenario in which CO2 emissions are reduced by 33% from baseline in 2030 is achievable at a marginal cost of USD 0 per tonne reduced. At this cost level, emission in 2010 can be reduced by 19% and by 24% in 2020. A scenario with 49% reduction from baseline in 2030 can be achieved at a marginal cost of USD 100 per tonne (27% in 2010 and 35% in 2020). Furthermore, it is evident that further increasing the cost level beyond USD 100 per tonne yield very little in terms of further emission reduction. The results also indicate that stabilising fleet emissions at current levels is obtainable at moderate costs, compensating for fleet growth up to 2030. However, significant reductions beyond current levels seem difficult to achieve. Marginal abatement costs for the major ship types are also calculated, and the results are shown to be relatively homogenous for all major ship types.

Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation.

Regional NOx source categories are strong contributors to surface ozone mixing ratios in three megacities. Local NOx emission control without regional involvement may raise the risk of increasing urban ozone levels due to the VOC-limited conditions. However, local NOx control provides considerable reduction of ozone in upper layers (up to 1 km where the ozone chemistry is NOx-limited) and helps improve regional air quality in downwind areas.

The new version of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v4.3.2) compiles gaseous and particulate air pollutant emissions, making use of the same anthropogenic sectors, time period (1970\u20132012), and international activity data that is used for estimating GHG emissions, as described in a companion paper (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2017). All human activities, except large scale biomass burning and land use, land-use change, and forestry are included in the emissions calculation. The bottom-up compilation methodology of sector-specific emissions was applied consistently for all world countries, providing methodological transparency and comparability between countries. In addition to the activity data used to estimate GHG emissions, air pollutant emissions are determined by the process technology and end-of-pipe emission reduction abatements. Region-specific emission factors and abatement measures were selected from recent available scientific literature and reports. Compared to previous versions of EDGAR, the EDGAR v4.3.2 dataset covers all gaseous and particulate air pollutants, has extended time series (1970\u20132012), and has been evaluated with quality control and quality assurance (QC and QA) procedures both for the emission time series (e.g. particulate matter \u2013 PM \u2013 mass balance, gap-filling for missing data, the split-up of countries over time, few updates in the emission factors, etc.) and grid maps (full coverage of the world, complete mapping of EDGAR emissions with sector-specific proxies, etc.). This publication focuses on the gaseous air pollutants of CO, NOx, SO2, total non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), NH3, and the aerosols PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC). Considering the 1970\u20132012 time period, global emissions of SO2 increased from 99 to 103\u2009Mt, CO from 441 to 562\u2009Mt, NOx from 68 to 122\u2009Mt, NMVOC from 119 to 170\u2009Mt, NH3 from 25 to 59\u2009Mt, PM10 from 37 to 65\u2009Mt, PM2.5 from 24 to 41\u2009Mt, BC from 2.7 to 4.5\u2009Mt, and OC from 9 to 11\u2009Mt. We present the country-specific emission totals and analyze the larger emitting countries (including the European Union) to provide insights on major sector contributions. In addition, per capita and per GDP emissions and implied emission factors \u2013 the apparent emissions per unit of production or energy consumption \u2013 are presented. We find that the implied emission factors (EFs) are higher for low-income countries compared to high-income countries, but in both cases decrease from 1970 to 2012. The comparison with other global inventories, such as the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Inventory (HTAP v2.2) and the Community Emission Data System (CEDS), reveals insights on the uncertainties as well as the impact of data revisions (e.g. activity data, emission factors, etc.). As an additional metric, we analyze the emission ratios of some pollutants to CO2 (e.g. CO\u2215CO2, NOx\u2215CO2, NOx\u2215CO, and SO2\u2215CO2) by sector, region, and time to identify any decoupling of air pollutant emissions from energy production activities and to demonstrate the potential of such ratios to compare to satellite-derived emission data. Gridded emissions are also made available for the 1970\u20132012 historic time series, disaggregated for 26 anthropogenic sectors using updated spatial proxies. The analysis of the evolution of hot spots over time allowed us to identify areas with growing emissions and where emissions should be constrained to improve global air quality (e.g. China, India, the Middle East, and some South American countries are often characterized by high emitting areas that are changing rapidly compared to Europe or the USA, where stable or decreasing emissions are evaluated). Sector- and component-specific contributions to grid-cell emissions may help the modelling and satellite communities to disaggregate atmospheric column amounts and concentrations into main emitting sectors. This work addresses not only the emission inventory and modelling communities, but also aims to broaden the usefulness of information available in a global emission inventory such as EDGAR to also include the measurement community.

An important N2O producing and reducing process in soils is denitrification, which shows deceased rates at low pH. No clear relationship between N2O emissions and soil pH has yet been established because also the relative contribution of N2O as the denitrification end product decreases with pH. Our aim was to show the net effect of soil pH on N2O production and emission. Therefore, experiments were designed to investigate the effects of pH on NO3\u2212 reduction, N2O production and reduction and N2 production in incubations with pH values set between 4 and 7. Furthermore, field measurements of soil pH and N2O emissions were carried out. In incubations, NO3\u2212 reduction and N2 production rates increased with pH and net N2O production rate was highest at pH 5. N2O reduction to N2 was halted until NO3\u2212 was depleted at low pH values, resulting in a built up of N2O. As a consequence, N2O:N2 production ratio decreased exponentially with pH. N2O reduction appeared therefore more important than N2O production in explaining net N2O production rates. In the field, a negative exponential relationship for soil pH against N2O emissions was observed. Soil pH could therefore be used as a predictive tool for average N2O emissions in the studied ecosystem. The occurrence of low pH spots may explain N2O emission hotspot occurrence. Future studies should focus on the mechanism behind small scale soil pH variability and the effect of manipulating the pH of soils.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "29152f300576bf6c8954c3764eedaad2bb9fad3e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2130338957", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-14-9317-2014", "CorpusId": 16871314}, "title": "Global data set of biogenic VOC emissions calculated by the MEGAN model over the last 30 years", "abstract": "Abstract.

Similarly, the current framing of climate change cannot be reconciled with the rates of mitigation necessary to stabilize at 550\u200appmv CO2e and even an optimistic interpretation suggests stabilization much below 650\u200appmv CO2e is improbable.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "65d03a168da0da3889c64ed20073a907f03f1177", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1964912153", "DOI": "10.1080/01614949608006464", "CorpusId": 93037442}, "title": "Catalytic Properties of Ceria and CeO2-Containing Materials", "abstract": "Abstract Over the past several years, cerium oxide and CeO2-containing materials have come under intense scrutiny as catalysts and as structural and electronic promoters of heterogeneous catalytic reactions.

Rapid economic and industrial development in China and relatively weak emission controls have resulted in significant increases in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in recent years, with the exception of late 2008 to mid 2009 when the economic downturn led to emission reductions detectable from space. Here vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric NO 2 retrieved from satellite observations by SCIAMACHY, GOME-2 and OMI (both by KNMI and by NASA) are used to evaluate changes in emissions of NO x from October 2004 to February 2010 identifying impacts of the economic downturn. Data over polluted regions of Northern East China suggest an increase of 27\u201333 % in 12-month mean VCD of NO 2 prior to the downturn, consistent with an increase of 49 % in thermal power generation (TPG) reflecting the economic growth. More detailed analysis is used to quantify changes in emissions of NO x in January over the period 2005\u20132010 when the effect of the downturn was most evident. The GEOS-Chem model is employed to evaluate the effect of changes in chemistry and meteorology on VCD of NO 2 . This analysis indicates that emissions decreased by 20 % from January 2008 to January 2009, close to the reduction of 18 % in TPG that occurred over the same interval. A combination of three independent approaches indicates that the economic downturn was responsible for a reduction in emissions by 9\u201311 % in January 2009 with an additional decrease of 10 % attributed to the slow-down in industrial activity associated with the coincident celebration of the Chinese New Year; errors in the estimate are most likely less than 3.4 %.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9cfdf3a3b64d6acdf466bc3ffb669caa3e609d43", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1942435767", "DOI": "10.4271/2008-01-0069", "CorpusId": 45105687}, "title": "Diesel Emission Control in Review", "abstract": "The paper summarizes the key developments in diesel emission control, generally for 2005.

In general, dedicated mercury removal is considerably more expensive than a co-benefit strategy, using air pollution control equipment originally designed to limit emissions of criterion pollutants, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, or oxides of nitrogen. Substantial benefits can be achieved globally by introducing mercury emission reduction measures because they reduce human and wildlife exposure to methyl mercury.

This study used serial intradialytic H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography scanning to confirm that the development of dialysis-induced RWMAs was associated with reduction in myocardial blood flow (MBF).\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nFour prevalent hemodialysis patients without angiographically significant coronary artery disease had measurements of MBF during standard hemodialysis and biofeedback dialysis. All patients underwent serial measurements of MBF using positron emission tomography. Concurrent echocardiography was used to assess left ventricular function and the development of RWMAs. Hemodynamic variables were measured using continuous pulse wave analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean prehemodialysis MBF was within the normal range. Global MBF was acutely reduced during hemodialysis. Segmental MBF was reduced to a significantly greater extent in areas that developed RWMAs compared with those that did not. Not all regions with reduced MBF were functionally affected, but a reduction in myocardial blood flow of >30% from baseline was significantly associated with the development of RWMAs. No significant differences in hemodynamic tolerability, RWMA development, or MBF between dialysis modalities were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHemodialysis is associated with repetitive myocardial ischemia, which, in the absence of coronary artery disease, may be due to coronary microvascular dysfunction. Stress-induced segmental left ventricular dysfunction correlates with matched reduction in MBF. Functional poststress recovery is consistent with myocardial stunning induced by hemodialysis.

CH4 emissions from landfilling were also estimated from biogenic carbon in waste. Applying the resulting emission factors to various EfW cases suggests that the current level of GHG emissions is significant but can be substantially reduced by increased use of EfW.

Existing state regulations in California and Massachusetts require \u223c15% greenhouse gas emissions reductions from current levels by 2020. However, government estimates for total US methane emissions may be biased by 50%, and estimates of individual source sectors are even more uncertain. This study uses atmospheric methane observations to reduce this level of uncertainty. We find greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and fossil fuel extraction and processing (i.e., oil and/or natural gas) are likely a factor of two or greater than cited in existing studies. Effective national and state greenhouse gas reduction strategies may be difficult to develop without appropriate estimates of methane emissions from these source sectors. This study quantitatively estimates the spatial distribution of anthropogenic methane sources in the United States by combining comprehensive atmospheric methane observations, extensive spatial datasets, and a high-resolution atmospheric transport model. Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of \u223c1.5 and \u223c1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are \u223c2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 \u00b1 3% of national emissions.

Blue fluorescence with a relatively narrow bandwidth when excited with UV irradiation has also been detected from chemically reduced GO (rGO) and graphene quantum dots. 6] Recently, chemically modified GO or rGO with n-butylamine or Mn has also demonstrated PL emission at a range of energies. 10] A detailed explanation of the origin of such variable energy PL in GO has yet to be elucidated. This is partly because the sample preparation and reduction methods varied, making it difficult to compare the results. Herein, we have prepared GO suspensions that exhibit virtually all of the PL features observed by different groups, through careful and gradual reduction of the GO. The systematic evolution of the electronic structure and comprehensive analysis of steady-state and transient PL along with photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy measurements indicate that two different types of electronically excited states are responsible for the observed emission characteristics. GO was synthesized using the modified Hummers method, the details of which have been reported. GO usually contains a large fraction of sp hybridized carbon atoms bound to oxygen functional groups, which makes it an insulator. Reduction can be achieved chemically (e.g. hydrazine exposure) or by thermal annealing in inert environments. Photothermal reduction of GO can be achieved by exposing GO samples to a Xenon flash in ambient conditions. In this study, we prepared aqueous GO solutions and subjected them to steady-state Xe lamp irradiation (500 W) with different exposure times of up to three hours. In contrast to reduction by an instantaneous flash, this method provides a controllable, gradual transformation from GO to rGO, allowing exploration of the PL evolution and emission mechanisms from as-synthesized GO to rGO. The deoxygenation of GO after reduction was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Figure 1. The C 1s signals of the original GO can be deconvoluted into signals for the C=C bond in aromatic rings (284.6 eV), C O bond (286.1 eV), C=O bond (287.5 eV), and C(=O) OH bond (289.2 eV), in agreement with previous assignments.

P. tremuloides exhibited a 33% reduction when grown at 1200\u2003ppmv CO2, compared with 600\u2003ppmv CO2. We used current models of leaf isoprene emission to demonstrate that significant errors occur if the CO2 inhibition of isoprene is not taken into account. In order to alleviate these errors, we present a new model of isoprene emission that describes its response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The model logic is based on assumed competition between cytosolic and chloroplastic processes for pyruvate, one of the principal substrates of isoprene biosynthesis.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "6a1f269530038167a98aa58da3d02d174e980017", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068009411", "DOI": "10.1039/c0cc04812g", "CorpusId": 24765696, "PubMed": "21173992"}, "title": "Facile preparation and upconversion luminescence of graphene quantum dots.", "abstract": "A facile hydrazine hydrate reduction of graphene oxide (GO) with surface-passivated by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) method for the fabrication of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with frequency upconverted emission is presented.

United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change talks are now considering mechanisms for avoiding deforestation (AD), but the economic potential of AD has yet to be addressed. We use three economic models of global land use and management to analyze the potential contribution of AD activities to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. AD activities are found to be a competitive, low-cost abatement option.

Methane-producing (methanogenic) and methane-consuming (methanotrophic) microorganisms control the emission of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, to the atmosphere. Earlier studies identified methanotrophic microorganisms that use methane as an electron donor and oxygen, sulfate, nitrite, and nitrate as electron acceptors. Previous research showed that methanotrophy coupled to the reduction of oxidized metals could be important in the environment. In the current paper, we identified archaea of the order Methanosarcinales, related to \u201cCandidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens,\u201d which couple the reduction of environmentally relevant particulate forms of iron and manganese to methane oxidation, filling one of the remaining lacunas in anaerobic methane oxidation. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is crucial for controlling the emission of this potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Nitrite-, nitrate-, and sulfate-dependent methane oxidation is well-documented, but AOM coupled to the reduction of oxidized metals has so far been demonstrated only in environmental samples. Here, using a freshwater enrichment culture, we show that archaea of the order Methanosarcinales, related to \u201cCandidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens,\u201d couple the reduction of environmentally relevant forms of Fe3+ and Mn4+ to the oxidation of methane. We obtained an enrichment culture of these archaea under anaerobic, nitrate-reducing conditions with a continuous supply of methane. Via batch incubations using [13C]methane, we demonstrated that soluble ferric iron (Fe3+, as Fe-citrate) and nanoparticulate forms of Fe3+ and Mn4+ supported methane-oxidizing activity. CO2 and ferrous iron (Fe2+) were produced in stoichiometric amounts. Our study connects the previous finding of iron-dependent AOM to microorganisms detected in numerous habitats worldwide. Consequently, it enables a better understanding of the interaction between the biogeochemical cycles of iron and methane.", "year": 2016}]}
