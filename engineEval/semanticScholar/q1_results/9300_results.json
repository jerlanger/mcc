Forests and their carbon (C) sequestration potential are affected by management practices, where wood harvesting transfers C out of the forest into products, and subsequent regrowth al- lows further C sequestration. Here we determine the miti- gation potential of the 2.3 \u25ca 10 6 km 2 of Canada's managed forests from 2015 to 2050 using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), a harvested wood products (HWP) model that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of emis- sion substitution benefits from the use of wood products and bioenergy. We examine several mitigation scenarios with dif- ferent assumptions about forest management activity levels relative to a base case scenario, including improved growth from silvicultural activities, increased harvest and residue management for bioenergy, and reduced harvest for conser- vation. We combine forest management options with two mitigation scenarios for harvested wood product use involv- ing an increase in either long-lived products or bioenergy uses. Results demonstrate large differences among alterna- tive scenarios, and we identify potential mitigation scenarios with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future, as well as scenarios with no net benefit over many decades. The greatest mitigation impact was achieved through a mix of strategies that varied across the country and had cumulative mitigation of 254 Tg CO2e in 2030, and 1180 Tg CO2e in 2050. There was a trade-off between short- term and long-term goals, in that maximizing short-term emissions reduction could reduce the forest sector's ability to contribute to longer-term objectives. We conclude that (i) national-scale forest sector mitigation options need to be as- sessed rigorously from a systems perspective to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (ii) a mix of strategies implemented across the country achieves the greatest mitigation impact, and (iii) be- cause of the time delays in achieving carbon benefits for many forest-based mitigation activities, future contributions of the forest sector to climate mitigation can be maximized if implemented soon.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "80b7241be76298eb5287eaa3d2f90b6cee179096", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3263517", "CorpusId": 201455924}, "title": "Towards Flexible Energy Demand \u2013 Preferences for Dynamic Contracts, Services and Emissions Reductions", "abstract": "Households\u2019 preferences for attributes of flexible energy demand are not well understood.

The ultraviolet P Cygni lines show strong broad absorption near X-ray eclipse and narrow absorption when the X-ray source is in the line of sight. The effect is visible during both the X-ray high and X-ray low states; the UV continuum flux remains roughly constant in spite of more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in X-ray flux, as expected if the X-ray flux reduction is due to occultation of the X-ray source by a precessing disk rather than an intrinsic change in X-ray luminosity. The X-ray spectra are dominated by continuum emission in the X-ray high state. Occultation of the neutron star by the disk during the low state also implies that X-ray emission from the disk surface should be present, and the low-state spectra do show strong emission lines. During eclipse and during the X-ray low state, the continuum emission largely disappears, and we see line emission from O, Ne, Mg, and Fe and possibly from Si and S.

Due to increased westerlies in winter the annual mean wind speed will be between 2 and 13% larger compared to present climate. Both changes will cause a reduction of the average salinity of the Baltic Sea between 8 and 50%. Although salinity in the entire Baltic might be significantly lower at the end of the twenty-first century, deep water ventilation will very likely only slightly change. The largest change is projected for the secondary maximum of sea water age within the halocline. Further, the average temperature will increase between 1.9 and 3.2\u00b0C.

However, this promise comes with many risks. Injection of sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, for example, would damage the ozone layer. Injection of calcite (or limestone) particles rather than sulfuric acid could counter ozone loss by neutralizing acids resulting from anthropogenic emissions, acids that contribute to the chemical cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. Calcite aerosol geoengineering may cool the planet while simultaneously repairing the ozone layer. Injecting sulfate aerosol into the stratosphere, the most frequently analyzed proposal for solar geoengineering, may reduce some climate risks, but it would also entail new risks, including ozone loss and heating of the lower tropical stratosphere, which, in turn, would increase water vapor concentration causing additional ozone loss and surface warming. We propose a method for stratospheric aerosol climate modification that uses a solid aerosol composed of alkaline metal salts that will convert hydrogen halides and nitric and sulfuric acids into stable salts to enable stratospheric geoengineering while reducing or reversing ozone depletion. Rather than minimizing reactive effects by reducing surface area using high refractive index materials, this method tailors the chemical reactivity. Specifically, we calculate that injection of calcite (CaCO3) aerosol particles might reduce net radiative forcing while simultaneously increasing column ozone toward its preanthropogenic baseline. A radiative forcing of \u22121 W\u22c5m\u22122, for example, might be achieved with a simultaneous 3.8% increase in column ozone using 2.1 Tg\u22c5y\u22121 of 275-nm radius calcite aerosol. Moreover, the radiative heating of the lower stratosphere would be roughly 10-fold less than if that same radiative forcing had been produced using sulfate aerosol. Although solar geoengineering cannot substitute for emissions cuts, it may supplement them by reducing some of the risks of climate change. Further research on this and similar methods could lead to reductions in risks and improved efficacy of solar geoengineering methods.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "3812f5d5cefc0e8f6cdd06441ceeecdbcafae21f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2074343708", "DOI": "10.1021/ES0112184", "CorpusId": 26058413, "PubMed": "12433160"}, "title": "Deposition and emission of gaseous mercury to and from Lake Michigan during the Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study (July, 1994-October, 1995).", "abstract": "This paper presents measurements of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations in Lake Michigan and the application of a mechanistic approach to estimate deposition and emission fluxes of gaseous mercury (Hg2+ and Hg0) to and from Lake Michigan.

This paper explores how improved on\u2010farm irrigation management can help in reducing groundwater extraction, limiting energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In Pakistan, every year about 50 billion cubic metres (BCM) of groundwater is pumped for irrigation, which consumes more than 6 billion kWh of electricity and 3.5 billion litres of diesel. Carbon emissions attributed to this energy use amount to 3.8 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2 per year. Considerable research carried out in Pakistan has suggested that improved irrigation management can significantly reduce the irrigation water applied to different crops. This study revealed that by adopting improved irrigation schedules, water productivity will increase and groundwater withdrawals for irrigation can be reduced by 24 BCM. Reduced groundwater extraction will result in a 62% decline in energy demand (1.5 billion litres of diesel as most of the private tubewells run on diesel) and a 40% reduction in carbon emissions.

A strict distinction between these source types is needed to support international agreements on emission reductions. However, the nomenclatures in existing emission inventories treat several source sectors ambiguously, such that certain emissions are considered man-made in one system and natural in the other. An investigation of the situation for Europe reveals that there are three such sources sectors that contribute significantly (more than 10%) to the total emissions of at least one pollutant: animal husbandry, forests, and possibly soils. Using qualitative parameters for distinguishing between natural and cultivated systems, it may be concluded that, at least under European conditions, both animal husbandry and soils as emission sources are controlled by humans in nearly all aspects. Forests, even if managed, as is the European practice, retain many natural characteristics. However, even for forests, emissions are certainly very different to those existing before human influence became dominant because of extensive deforestation and replanting (often of nonnative species). A \u201ccolonization\u201d theory approach suggests that just such a difference between the natural situation and the conditions as caused by man are attributed to anthropogenic emissions.

Data from a total of 30 experiments comprising 171 treatments were entered in a database. In vitro batch culture and in vivo measurements were distinguished as experimental approaches. With any approach, methane declined when dietary tannins increased. The in vitro approach predicted the in vivo response quite accurately. However, in vitro, the response followed a quadratic response pattern (R(2) = 0.66; lower response with increasing tannin level), whereas in vivo, this decline was linear (R(2) = 0.29). This indicates that the in vitro batch culture is of limited accuracy for estimating effects at levels >100 g tannin/kg dry matter. The large variation in methane/digestible organic matter (OM) found at low tannin levels may explain contrasting literature reports. Methane reduction with tannins was associated with a reduced apparent digestion of OM, and especially fibre, but methane/apparently digestible OM declined also.

Recently, it has become essential to use design methodologies including computer simulations for diesel engines that have small amounts of NOx and SOOT while maintaining reasonable fuel economy. For this purpose, multi-objective optimization techniques should be used. Multi-objective optimization problems have several types of objectives and they should be minimized or maximized at the same time. There is often a trade-off relationship between objects and derivation of the Pareto optimum solutions that express the relationship between the objects is one of the goals in this case. The proposed system consists of a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and phenomenological model. MOGA has strong search capability for Pareto optimum solutions. However, MOGA requires a large number of iterations. Therefore, for MOGA, a diesel combustion simulator that can express combustion precisely with small calculation cost is essential. Phenomenological models can simulate diesel engine combustions precisely with small calculation cost. Therefore, phenomenological models are suitable for MOGA. In the optimization simulations, fuel injection shape, boost pressure, EGR rate, start angle of injection, duration angle of injection, and swirl ration were chosen as design variables. The values of these design variables were optimized to reduce SFC, NOx, and SOOT. Through the optimization simulations, the following five points were made clarified. First, the proposed system can find the Pareto optimum solutions successfully. Second, MOGAs are very effective to derive the solutions. Third, phenomenological models are very suitable for MOGAs, as they can perform precise simulations with small calculation cost. Fourth, multi-pulse injection shape can affect the amounts of SFC, NOx, and SOOT.

Two mechanisms responsible for the structural degradation of the multiple quantum well (MQW) active region were identified. It was found that during the growth of the p-type GaN capping layer, loss of part of the active region enclosed within a trench defect occurred, affecting the top-most QWs in the MQW stack. Indium platelets and voids were also found to form preferentially at the bottom of the MQW stack. The presence of high densities of trench defects in the LEDs was found to relate to a significant reduction in photoluminescence and electroluminescence emission efficiency, for a range of excitation power densities and drive currents. This reduction in emission efficiency was attributed to an increase in the density of non-radiative recombination centres within the MQW stack, believed to be associated with the stacking mismatch boundaries which form part of the sub-surface structure of the trench defects. Investigation of the surface of green-emitting QW structures found a two decade increase in the density of trench defects, compared to its blue-emitting counterpart, suggesting that the efficiency of green-emitting LEDs may be strongly affected by the presence of these defects.

Ideally, to promote combustion withmaximumefficiency andminimumharmful emissions, an injector should deliver a fuel spray that rapidly disperses and evaporates to yield a homogeneousmixture of gaseous fuel and air. Characteristics of an ideal injector include good atomization over a wide range of either steady or transient fuel flow rates, unaffected by flow instabilities, low power requirements, scalability, resistant to blockages, and delivery of a fine spray [1,2]. Reviews by McDonell and Samuelsen [3], Razdan [4],Mansour [5], andNakamura et al. [6] deal with fuel sprays optimized for lean combustion. Pressure atomization, air-assist and air-blast atomization, and effervescent atomization [7] are commonly used techniques for a variety of injector applications. In the current study, we are exploring the so-called flow-blurring injector of Ganan-Calvo [8] in a combustion system. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the flow-blurring (FB) concept consists of a liquid nozzle and an orifice plate situated downstream of the nozzle. The nozzle\u2019s wall is tapered at the outlet, and the sharpened edge of the orifice plate is the same diameter as the inner diameter of the nozzle (d). When the axial distance between the nozzle exit and orifice plate (H) is small (i.e., H=d < 0:25), some of the gas flowing into the lateral cylindrical passageway between the nozzle exit and orifice plane is forced upstream a short distance into the nozzle carrying the liquid. The backflow of gas causes vigorous combination of turbulent mixing and effervescing, or the so-called flow-blurring, which results in a spray with very fine droplets. Simmons et al. [9] conducted cold-flow visualization experiments for a range of geometric and flow conditions to demonstrate the high efficiency of the FB injector concept. To the best of our knowledge, the FB injector concept has never been applied to combustion systems. The objective of this study is to experimentally characterize emissions performance of the FB injector in a liquid-fueled combustor operated at atmospheric pressure. Experiments using diesel and kerosene fuels are performed for fixed fuel and total airflow rates, and the atomizing airflow rate is varied. The FB injector performance (NOx and CO emissions) is compared with that of a commercial air-blast (AB) injector. II.

A static, single period, multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Thai economy has been developed for this purpose. This study finds that the selection of a tax instrument to reduce CO, emissions would be significantly influenced by the scheme to recycle the tax revenue to the economy. If the tax revenue is recycled to finance cuts in the existing labour or indirect tax rates, carbon tax would be more efficient than the sulphur-, energy- and output-taxes to reduce CO2 emissions. On the other hand, if the tax revenue is recycled to households through a lump-sum transfer, sulphur and carbon taxes would be more efficient than energy and output taxes. The ranking between the sulphur and carbon taxes under the lump sum transfer scheme depends on substitution possibility of fossil fuels. Sulphur tax is found superior over carbon tax at the higher substitution possibility between fossil fuels; the reverse is found true at the lower substitution possibility. In all schemes of revenue recycling considered, the output tax is found to be the most costly (i.e., in welfare terms) despite the fact that it generates two to three times higher revenue than the other tax instruments.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "da12ff1361647101c4a2311cc71fa27f42b43f9f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2026441939", "DOI": "10.2514/1.C031529", "CorpusId": 109705901}, "title": "Optimized Profile Descent Arrivals at Los Angeles International Airport", "abstract": "The optimized profile descent is an example of one of the many NextGen technologies under development to modernize and increase the efficiency of the national airspace system.

In temperate regions, shrub willows are being developed as a SRWC because of their potential for high biomass production in short time periods, ease of vegetative propagation, broad genetic base, and ability to resprout after multiple harvests. Understanding and working with willow's biology is important for the agricultural and economic success of the system. The energy, environmental, and economic performance of willow biomass production and conversion to electricity is evaluated using life cycle modeling methods. The net energy ratio (electricity generated/life cycle fossil fuel consumed) for willow ranges from 10 to 13 for direct firing and gasification processes. Reductions of 70 to 98 percent (compared to U.S. grid generated electricity) in greenhouse gas emissions as well as NOx, SO2, and particulate emissions are achieved. Despite willow's multiple environmental and rural development benefits, its high cost of production has limited deployment. Costs will be lowered by significant improvements in yields and production efficiency and by valuing the system's environmental and rural development benefits. Policies like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), federal biomass tax credits and renewable portfolio standards will make willow cost competitive in the near term. The avoided air pollution from the substitution of willow for conventional fossil fuel generated electricity has an estimated damage cost of $0.02 to $0.06 kWh\u22121. The land intensity of about 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 ha-yr/kWh is greater than other renewable energy sources. This may be considered the most significant limitation of willow, but unlike other biomass crops such as corn it can be cultivated on the millions of hectares of marginal agricultural lands, improving site conditions, soil quality and landscape diversity. A clear advantage of willow biomass compared to other renewables is that it is a stock resource whereas wind and PV are intermittent. With only 6 percent of the current U.S. energy consumption met by renewable sources the accelerated development of willow biomass and other renewable energy sources is critical to address concerns of energy security and environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "ae7fd79abea81f89b86b08a56fcc8b3e228a564e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2621055968", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RSER.2012.01.013", "CorpusId": 109654695}, "title": "Greenhouse gas emission reduction perspectives in the Baltic States in frames of EU energy and climate policy", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "335586187bedcff5c7d7e70329c9fb57b7d13224", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/soli/HuangSZW12", "MAG": "1987988142", "DOI": "10.1109/SOLI.2012.6273551", "CorpusId": 15052923}, "title": "A study on carbon reduction in the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries", "abstract": "Reducing greenhouse gases (GHG), especially carbon dioxide, has become a critical environmental issue worldwide and has attracted attentions in all economic sectors and industries.

This has enabled us to take a novel approach in diagnosing modern marine carbon cycling: assimilating observation of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of deep-sea sediments with an ensemble Kalman filter. The resulting calibrated model predicts a mean surface sediment content (32.5 wt%) close to the observed value (34.8 wt%), and a global burial rate of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments of 0.121 PgC yr , in line with recent budget estimates of 0.10 0.14 PgC yr . We employ the GENIE-1 model in quantifying the multimillennial-scale fate of fossil fuel CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In the absence of any interaction between ocean and sediments, an equilibrium partitioning of CO2 is reached within 1000 years of emissions ceasing, with 34% (645 ppm) remaining in the atmosphere out of a total fossil fuel burn of 4173 PgC. An additional 12% of CO2 emissions (223 ppm) are sequestered as bicarbonate ions (HCO3 ) by reaction with deep-sea carbonates (\u2018\u2018seafloor CaCO3 neutralization\u2019\u2019) on a timescale of 1.7 ka. Excess of carbonate weathering on land over deep-sea burial results in a further net transformation of 14% of CO2 emissions (261 ppm) into HCO3 (\u2018\u2018terrestrial CaCO3 neutralization\u2019\u2019) on a timescale of 8.3 ka. We have also assessed the importance of a changing climate in modulating the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 through ocean-sediment interaction. Increased ocean stratification suppresses particulate organic carbon export, which in turn enhances seafloor CaCO3 preservation. The resulting reduction in the sequestration of fossil fuel CO2 represents a new positive feedback on millennial-scale climate change. Citation: Ridgwell, A., and J. C.

This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO2 equivalents (CO2-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO2-e) and BC (29 000 t CO2-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "44300ff7206d25cd1b942e3e244e1f039766c1a5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2001701373", "DOI": "10.1161/01.CIR.64.4.689", "CorpusId": 38384319, "PubMed": "6974061"}, "title": "LOCALIZATION OF VIABLE, ISCHEMIC MYOCARDIUM BY POSITRON\u2010EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY WITH 11C\u2010PALMITATE", "abstract": "A study was performed to determine whether viable, but ischemic, tissue could be detected and localized in vivo based on external detection of impaired fatty acid metabolism.

It was prepared by IPCC in collaboration with the Scientific Assessment Panel to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, in response to a request by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) because of the potential impact of aviation emissions. These are the predominant anthropogenic emissions deposited directly into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Aviation has experienced rapid expansion as the world economy has grown. Passenger traffic (expressed as revenue passenger kilometers) has grown since 1960 at nearly 9% per year, 2.4 times the average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate. Freight traffic, approximately 80% of which is carried by passenger airplanes, has also grown over the same time period. The rate of growth of passenger traffic has slowed to about 5% in 1997 as the industry is maturing. Total aviation emissions have increased, because increased demand for air transport has outpaced the reductions in specific emissions3 from the continuing improvements in technology and operational procedures. Passenger traffic, assuming unconstrained demand, is projected to grow at rates in excess of GDP for the period assessed in this report. The effects of current aviation and of a range of unconstrained growth projections for aviation (which include passenger, freight, and military) are examined in this report, including the possible effects of a fleet of second generation, commercial supersonic aircraft. The report also describes current aircraft technology, operating procedures, and options for mitigating aviation's future impact on the global atmosphere. The report does not consider the local environmental effects of aircraft engine emissions or any of the indirect environmental effects of aviation operations such as energy usage by ground transportation at airports.

Emissions of particulate matter from biomass burning have drawn considerable attention because of concern over their possible toxicity and implications for human health. For small-scale applications, it is desirable to employ a simple, compact, and inexpensive solution to avoid air quality problems related to biomass combustion. Electrostatic precipitation is a very reliable method to control particulate emissions from boilers, incinerators, and other industrial processes. It is therefore applied to small combustors. In this work, a simple, compact, and cost-effective multiple tubular electrostatic precipitator was designed and evaluated theoretically and experimentally for removal of particulate matter from a small biomass combustor. The precipitator consisted of a simple array of coaxial discharge electrodes placed along the axis of each cylindrical collection tube. The discharge electrodes were connected to the positive high-voltage supply, while the cylindrical collection tubes were grounded. The positive high-voltage supply was used to produce the corona discharge field between individual discharge electrode and collection tube. The particle-laden exhaust gas flow from the small biomass furnace was directed across the corona discharge field and then charged. The charged particles were deflected outward in a radial direction and deposited on the collection tube wall. The overall collection efficiency of the electrostatic device was evaluated as a mass loading ratio of the difference at inlet and outlet to the particle loading at the inlet of the device. It was found that about 70% overall collection efficiency can be achieved with a relatively simple multiple tubular electrostatic precipitator design.

Tests combining these two techniques were carried out on a single-cylinder research engine (SCRE) based on a modified heavy-duty automotive engine. No attempt was made to optimize the engine's combustion chamber or the injector geometry for EGR operation. The SCRE's independent charge-air system allowed for more controlled testing over a wider range of test variables than can be carried out by a standard engine. These tests investigated the effects of cooled EGR on particulate matter (PM) and NOX emissions while varying the injection timing, engine speed, equivalence ratio and intake manifold pressure. The results suggested that, with EGR, higher equivalence ratios reduced power-specific NOX but increased PM emissions. Increasing the charge mass at a constant EGR fraction resulted in significant reductions in PM, at the cost of slightly increased NOX By advancing the injection timing at high EGR fractions, PM emissions and fuel efficiency were improved, with only a slight increase in NOX emissions compared to the more retarded injection timings. The engine speed influenced the amount of EGR that could be recirculated, with lower speeds resulting in higher achievable EGR fractions.

Using the derived emission factors from local measurements, rice cultivation contributes 566.6 Gg of methane emission in the Philippines. This value is 62% of the total methane emitted from the agriculture sector. The emission factors employed which are 78% of the IPCC value for irrigated rice and 95% for rainfed rice were derived from measurements with an automatic system taken during the growth duration in the respective ecosystems. Plots drained for 2 weeks at midtillering and before harvest gave a significant reduction in methane emission as opposed to continuously flooded plots and plots drained before harvest. The cultivar Magat reduced methane emission by 50% as compared to the check variety IR72. The application of ammonium sulfate instead of urea reduced methane emission by 10% to more\u00a0\u00bb 34%.

The Paris Agreement\u2019s aim to keep the average global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius implies that drastic emission cuts from agriculture are needed. The sequestration potential of agriculture and land use offers an important mechanism to achieve a transition to net-zero carbon emissions worldwide. So far, however, states have been reluctant to address emissions from, and sequestration by, the agricultural sector. Some states that have or are setting up a domestic emission-trading scheme allow for the generation of offsets in agriculture, but only to a limited extent. Australia is the only country that has a rather broad set of methodologies in place to award credits to farmers for all kinds of carbon-farming projects. This article reviews the experience with the Australian model so far, with the objective of articulating transferable lessons for regulatory design aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. It finds that it is possible to regulate for the reduction of emissions from agriculture and for increased sequestration in agricultural soils and in vegetation on agricultural lands, provided that certain conditions are met. Regulation must focus on individual projects at farms, based on a long-term policy that has a wider focus than just emission reduction. Such projects must comply with climate-smart methodologies that ensure the delivery of real, additional, measurable, and verifiable emission reductions and also foster long-term innovation and create economic, social, and environmental co-benefits.

China\u2019s grain production increased by 74% between 1982 and 2017, while chemical fertilizer use tripled over the same period4. The average nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for crop production in China is approximately 0.25 (ref. 5), indicating substantial reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses to the environment. The losses include ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which contribute to health-damaging PM2.5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of <2.5 \u03bcm) air pollution and global warming, respectively, as well as NO3 and organic N leaching and runoff, which contaminate drinking water and cause eutrophication5,6. As the world\u2019s largest meat and egg producer7, China also contributes approximately 25% of global manure N production8,9. Only one-third of manure N annually produced in China is utilized by crops or stored in the soil, with two-thirds released as environmental pollution8. Chinese policymakers increasingly recognize the interconnections between air and water pollution, climate change, low NUE and China\u2019s poor agricultural N management practices. Facing severe PM2.5 air pollution10\u201312, previous policies in China have focused on controlling point sources, without attention paid to dispersed agricultural sources. However, it is now known that controlling agricultural NH3 emissions is effective for PM2.5 mitigation when gaseous NH3 limits the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) ([S IA] = [NH4] + [NO3] + [SO4]), which has been reported in winter in the eastern United States13, Europe14,15 and China\u2019s Pearl River Delta16, and in summer in Europe15. China\u2019s Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Battle for a Blue Sky17, enacted in 2018 for the first time, encourages NH3 emission reductions, although no quantitative target has been specified. NH3 emission reductions must be achieved through improved synchronization between N supply and crop demand and improved manure N utilization. Furthermore, such improvements increase crop yields and NUE, as well as decreasing N2O and NO3 leaching and runoff18. The government has set several policy measures for improving food security and NUE, which are viewed as separate efforts from air pollution policies, including: zero N fertilizer use increase by 202019; an action plan for converting animal manure to nutrients (2017\u20132020)20; a plan for 75% of livestock and poultry waste to be disposed of with no harm to the environment17; and a tightened regulatory standard for the discharge of animal waste to rivers that has been drafted for public review21.

While adding wind or solar reduces electricity system emissions, the emissions effect of both renewable generation and energy storage varies by location. In this work, we apply a marginal emissions approach to determine the net system CO2 emissions of colocated or electrically proximate wind/storage and solar/storage facilities across the U.S. and determine the amount of renewable energy required to offset the CO2 emissions resulting from operation of new energy storage. We find that it takes between 0.03 MW (Montana) and 4 MW (Michigan) of wind and between 0.25 MW (Alabama) and 17 MW (Michigan) of solar to offset the emissions from a 25 MW/100 MWh storage device, depending on location and operational mode.

The simulations provide guidance about which strategies are most effective for specific regions. Retrofit is preferable for high-income regions.

Gas has received a lot of attention as a transition fuel. This Climate Council submission to the NEM Security Review, therefore, focuses on whether gas-powered electricity generation has a role to play toward Australia reducing its emissions and meeting its Paris Agreement commitments. Human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas for electricity, are driving up greenhouse gas emissions and a long-term warming trend. Consequently, climate change is cranking up the intensity of extreme weather events in Australia, such as heatwaves, bushfires and coastal flooding. The impacts of extreme weather events will likely become much worse unless global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced rapidly and deeply. In ratifying the Paris Agreement, Australia committed to rapidly reduce our carbon emissions, transitioning to zero emissions before 2050. Despite this pledge to tackle climate change, Australia\u2019s emissions continue to rise, particularly from its largest source \u2013 the electricity sector. Furthermore, while some have argued that additional gas resource development is essential to transition to a low carbon electricity generation system, this will not be possible within the 2oC carbon budget - because tackling climate change requires that most of the world\u2019s (including Australia\u2019s) fossil fuels be left in the ground, unburned. Additionally, building new gas power plants and infrastructure based on policy schemes which foster new gas development, risk \u201clocking-in\u201d expanded gas use for decades into the future, and dramatic expansion of new unconventional gas resource exploration and development, and associated fossil fuel delivery infrastructure. The fundamentals of the current electricity industry rule making and governance structure must change to bring the industry into the 21st century. The Paris Agreement and global carbon budget means that a fourth objective must be included as an overarching objective for the National Electricity Market \u2013 that being an essential requirement that all rule making, governance and operations must be consistent with the sector achieving, at a minimum, its proportionate share of national emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. To protect Australians from worsening climate impacts (eg more destructive storms, intense heatwaves and worsening bushfire conditions) and in line with our Paris Agreement commitments and carbon budget constraints, Australia needs pathways to transition as rapidly as possible away from coal, oil and gas to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Developing new gas (and other fossil fuel) projects is fundamentally at odds with attaining this goal.

The global aerosol\u2013climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ was used to investigate changes in the aerosol burden and aerosol radiative effects in the coming decades. Four different emissions scenarios were applied for 2030 (two of them applied also for 2020) and the results were compared against the reference year 2005. Two of the scenarios are based on current legislation reductions: one shows the maximum potential of reductions that can be achieved by technical measures, and the other is targeted to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). We have analyzed the results in terms of global means and additionally focused on eight subregions. Based on our results, aerosol burdens show an overall decreasing trend as they basically follow the changes in primary and precursor emissions. However, in some locations, such as India, the burdens could increase significantly. The declining emissions have an impact on the clear-sky direct aerosol effect (DRE), i.e. the cooling effect. The DRE could decrease globally 0.06\u20130.4 W m\u22122 by 2030 with some regional increases, for example, over India (up to 0.84 W m\u22122). The global changes in the DRE depend on the scenario and are smallest in the targeted SLCF simulation. The aerosol indirect radiative effect could decline 0.25\u20130.82 W m\u22122 by 2030. This decrease takes place mostly over the oceans, whereas the DRE changes are greatest over the continents. Our results show that targeted emission reduction measures can be a much better choice for the climate than overall high reductions globally. Our simulations also suggest that more than half of the near-future forcing change is due to the radiative effects associated with aerosol\u2013cloud interactions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "c1890eab8ad541ab83e7067df05750ca3cb49c1f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "28491468", "CorpusId": 54865823}, "title": "On the Risk of Overshooting 2\u00b0C", "abstract": "This article explores different greenhouse gas stabilization levels and their implied risks of overshooting certain temperature targets, such as limiting global mean temperature rise to 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The probabilistic assessment is derived from a compilation of recent estimates of the uncertainties in climate sensitivity, which summarizes the key uncertainties in climate science for long-term temperature projections. The risk of overshooting 2\u00b0C equilibrium warming is found to lie between 68% and 99% for stabilization at 550ppm CO2 equivalence. Only at levels around 400ppm CO2 equivalence are the risks of overshooting low enough so that the achievement of a 2\u00b0C target can be termed \u201clikely\u201d. Based on characteristics of 54 IPCC SRES and post-SRES scenarios, multi-gas emission pathways are presented that lead to stabilization at 550, 450 and 400ppm CO2eq in order to assess the implications for global emission reductions. Sensitivity studies on delayed global action show that the next 5 to 15 years might determine whether the risk of overshooting 2\u00b0C can be limited to a reasonable range.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "9149da4567600b604ba7c30b0b074d21504f0204", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1540696804", "CorpusId": 152957809}, "title": "Cost-Effective GHG Reductions through Smart Growth & Improved Transportation Choices: An Economic Case for Investment of Cap-and-Trade Revenues", "abstract": "This report evaluates the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through smart transportation pricing, smart growth, and improved transportation choices.

Besides, nutritional measures are presented to reduce environmental pollution by lowering excretion of N and P, emphasizing (multi) phase feeding, the use of low protein, synthetic amino acids supplemented diets, phytase and its effect on phosphorus and calcium digestibility, its interaction with phytic acid and proteins, and the environmental impact of the use of phytase in pig diets. Also, nutritional means are indicated to reduce ammonia volatilization from pig operations. It is concluded that nutrition management can substantially contribute to reduction of N and P excretion by pigs, mainly by lowering dietary protein levels, (multi) phase feeding and the use of microbial phytase, and that the use of phytase on a large scale in The Netherlands has a tremendous environmental impact. In 20 years the excretion of P in growing-finishing pigs has more than halved. Ammonia emission from manure of pigs can be reduced substantially by lowering dietary protein content, but also by including additional non-starch polysaccharides in the diet. A very promising method to reduce ammonia emission is to manipulate dietary cation-anion difference, e.g. by adding acidifying salts to the diet, which will lower pH of urine substantially. Further research is desirable. This also applies to determining dietary factors influencing the odour release from manure. Finally, some speculation on the future of pig farming from an environmental viewpoint is presented.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "ab885bc9e35e31ec9bce86d0820aec885e2b8d53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035484321", "DOI": "10.13073/FPJ-D-12-00023.1", "CorpusId": 13961726}, "title": "Woody Biomass Substitution for Thermal Energy at Softwood Lumber Mills in the US Inland Northwest", "abstract": "Abstract Using life-cycle inventory production data, the net global warming potential (GWP) of a typical inland Northwest softwood lumber mill was evaluated for a variety of fuel types used as boiler inputs and for electricity generation. Results focused on reductions in carbon emissions in terms of GWP relative to natural gas as the fossil alternative. Woody feedstocks included mill residues, forest residuals, and wood pellets. In all fuel-substitution scenarios, increasing the use of biomass for heat generation decreased GWP. Using woody biofuels for electricity production is somewhat less effective in lowering carbon emissions than when used for heat energy. Heat generation at the mill under the current practice of using about half self-generated mill residues and half natural gas resulted in a 35 percent reduction in GWP over 100 percent natural gas. The greatest reduction in GWP (66%) was from increased use of forest residuals for heat energy, eliminating the use of fossil fuels as a direct heating f...", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3ba588a27fb4801a4a745cd83f82f00ac87a99d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3048653481", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2004.04.023", "CorpusId": 153974650}, "title": "International markets for greenhouse gas emission reduction policies\u2014possibilities for integrating developing countries", "abstract": null, "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "88897514ddf3dcc5f85cf07d3802243a12372e24", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1855166619", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00084.x", "CorpusId": 153694475}, "title": "Shifting Trade Patterns as a Means of Reducing Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions", "abstract": "This article extends and applies the world trade model with bilateral trade (WTMBT), a linear program with any number of goods, factors, and regional trade partners that determines regional production, bilateral trade patterns, and region\u2010specific prices on the basis of comparative advantage by minimizing factor use. The model provides a consistent analysis of the global production system, representing geographical location at a regional level, region\u2010specific technologies at a sector level, emissions from production, and resource constraints and costs. An illustrative analysis investigates how changes in the geographic distribution of production could contribute to reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and at what cost. The model provides a bridge between global objectives and their determinants and consequences in specific sectors in individual regions. Multi\u2010objective analysis is used to construct a trade\u2010off curve between global factor costs and CO2 emissions. The relevance of both primal and dual solution variables is demonstrated. In particular, changes in goods prices and emissions are investigated. We conclude that the main impact of tightening carbon constraints is a substantial reduction in international trade accompanied by a shift away from regions most reliant on the combustion of coal. In addition to the analysis of the overall global trends, including the impact on prices, the implications of the global carbon constraint for one specific industry are investigated.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "a64893a4e155de812b87349448cebca9806437d2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3023261514", "DOI": "10.1093/ajae/aax050", "CorpusId": 157498377}, "title": "Foodservice Composting Crowds Out Consumer Food Waste Reduction Behavior in a Dining Experiment", "abstract": "&NA; Many countries strive to reduce food waste, which deprives hungry people of nutrition, depletes resources, and accounts for substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Composting and other food waste recycling technologies that divert food waste from landfills mitigate the environmental damages of food waste disposal and have grown in popularity. We explore whether consumer knowledge that the environmental damage created by their food waste will be mitigated by recycling technologies undermines personal food waste reduction behavior. Subjects in a dining situation are randomly assigned whether or not they receive information about the negative effects of landfilling food waste and whether they are told that uneaten food from the study will be composted or landfilled. We find that providing information about the negative effects of food waste in landfills significantly reduces the total amount of solid food waste created when compared to a control situation that features neither a food waste reduction nor a food waste recycling policy. However, if subjects are also informed that food waste from the study will be composted, the amount of solid food waste generated is significantly greater than if only the food waste reduction policy were implemented. This suggests a crowding out effect or informational rebound effect in which promoting policies that mitigate the environmental damages of food waste may unintentionally undermine policies meant to encourage individual consumer food waste reduction. We discuss key policy implications as well as several limitations of our experimental setting and analysis.", "year": 2017}]}
