Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide [CO2]) because of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70\u201385%) SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less than 1% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control policies.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "b8ca37eb64c6e602efba8bd08ccb11005b1b64cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2045528742", "DOI": "10.1366/000370206775382857", "CorpusId": 25566664, "PubMed": "16454914"}, "title": "Observations in Collinear Femtosecond\u2014Nanosecond Dual-Pulse Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy", "abstract": "In the work reported herein, we have combined a short-lived femtosecond laser-induced plasma (LIP) and a longer-lived nanosecond LIP in a collinear pulse configuration to examine the source(s) of atomic emission and signal-to-noise enhancement in dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

It shows that introducing inertia, in the form of the\"cost in time\"of available options, changes significantly the message from MACCs. With an abatement objective in cumulative emissions (e.g., emitting less than 200 GtCO2 in the 2000-2050 period), it makes sense to implement some of the more expensive options before the potential of the cheapest ones has been exhausted. With abatement targets expressed in terms of emissions at one point in time (e.g., reducing emissions by 20 percent in 2020), it can even be preferable to start with the implementation of the most expensive options if their potential is high and their inertia significant. Also, the best strategy to reach a short-term target is different depending on whether this target is the ultimate objective or there is a longer-term target. The best way to achieve Europe's goal of 20 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 is different if this objective is the ultimate objective or if it is only a milestone in a trajectory toward a 75 percent reduction in 2050. The cheapest options may be sufficient to reach the 2020 target but could create a carbon-intensive lock-in and preclude deeper emission reductions by 2050. These results show that in a world without perfect foresight and perfect credibility of the long-term carbon-price signal, a unique carbon price in all sectors is not the most efficient approach.

In-depth knowledge on the processes and variable factors that play a role in the emission of ammonia from dairy cow houses benefits the production of emission data, the development of low emission housing systems, and evaluation of emission levels in a farming system approach. A mechanistic simulation model for the ammonia emission from dairy cow houses was developed to facilitate this. An ammonia production model, with separate modules for the emission from the slurry pit and the slatted floor, was built and validated against measured data on the ammonia emission. Model improvements followed from this validation and were addressed in experiments on the development of the pH of urine deposited on floors and slurry, and on quantification of air exchange rates through slatted floors. The pH experiments revealed that the urine pH, after the urine was deposited on the floor or the slurry, increased to greater values than originally assumed. Furthermore, the air exchange through the openings of slatted floors was quantified, which made it possible to separately simulate the ammonia emission from the pit and from the floor. These unique theories were used to build a real ammonia emission model, with ammonia mass balances for the slurry pit and the air above the floor. The emission model was successfully validated against emission measurements conducted in a mechanically ventilated and a naturally ventilated cow house.

At the same time, identification of morphological changes occurring to catalysts under reaction conditions can be crucial to tune their catalytic performance. In this contribution we investigate the dependency of selectivity for CO2 reduction on the size of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and on support.

By utilizing in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the low-temperature redispersion process occurs via decomposition of the metal oxide phase with size-dependent kinetics, producing stable single-site RuO x/CeO2 species strongly bound to the CeO2 support that are remarkably selective for CO production.

CMAQ simulations using SAPRC07C and the previously released version, SAPRC99, were performed and compared for an episode during July\u2013 August, 2000. Ozone (O3) predictions of the SAPRC07C simulation are generally lower than those of the SAPRC99 simulation in the key areas of central and southern California, especially in areas where modeled concentrations are greater than the federal 8-hr O3 standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) and/or when the volatile organic compound (VOC)/nitrogen oxides (NOx) ratio is less than 13. The relative changes of ozone production efficiency (OPE) against the VOC/NOx ratio at 46 sites indicate that the OPE is reduced in SAPRC07C compared with SAPRC99 at most sites by as much as approximately 22%. The SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C mechanisms respond similarly to 20% reductions in anthropogenic VOC emissions. The response of the mechanisms to 20% NOx emissions reductions can be grouped into three cases. In case 1, in which both mechanisms show a decrease in daily maximum 8-hr O3 concentration with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 decrease in SAPRC07C is smaller. In case 2, in which both mechanisms show an increase in O3 with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 increase is larger in SAPRC07C. In case 3, SAPRC07C simulates an increase in O3 in response to reduced NOx emissions whereas SAPRC99 simulates a decrease in O3 for the same region. As a result, the areas where NOx controls would be disbeneficial are spatially expanded in SAPRC07C. Although the results presented here are valuable for understanding differences in predictions and model response for SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C, the study did not evaluate the impact of mechanism differences in the context of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance for using numerical models in demonstrating air quality attainment. Therefore, additional study is required to evaluate the full regulatory implications of upgrading air quality models to SAPRC07. IMPLICATIONS CMAQ simulations of gas-phase pollutants over California were conducted using the newly released SAPRC07C gas-phase chemical mechanism and the previous released version, SAPRC99. SAPRC07C predicted slightly lower concentrations of O3 and important radical species than did SAPRC99 in key polluted regions of California. In certain regions, SAPRC07C simulates an increase in O3 in response to 20% reductions in NOx emissions, whereas SAPRC99 simulates a decrease in O3.

A comparison of the joint PDF of subsistence and discretionary activities reveals that trips are conducted either before or after the commute schedule; this results in a temporal shift that reduces peak-period traffic congestion and emission pollution.

The effects of water limitations on the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds are not well understood. Experimental approaches studying drought effects in natural conditions are still missing. To address this question, a throughfall displacement experiment was set up in a natural forest of Quercus ilex, an evergreen Mediterranean oak emitting monoterpenes. Mature trees were exposed in 2005 and 2006 either to an additional drought, to irrigation or to natural drought (untreated control). In both years, absolute monoterpene emission rates as well as the respective standard factors of the trees exposed to normal and additional drought strongly declined during the drought periods. Monoterpene emissions were lower in year 2006 than in year 2005 (factor 2) due to a more pronounced summer drought period in this respective year. We observed a significant difference between the irrigation and additional drought or control treatment: irrigated trees emitted 82% more monoterpenes during the drought period 2006 than the trees of the other treatments. However, no significant effect on monoterpene emission was observed between normal and additional drought treatments, despite a significant effect on leaf water potential and photochemical efficiency. During the development of drought, monoterpene emissions responded exponentially rather than linearly to decreasing leaf water potential. Emissions rapidly declined when the water potential dropped below \u22122 MPa and photosynthesis was persistently inhibited. Monoterpene synthase activities measured in vitro showed no clear reduction during the same period. From our results we conclude that drought significantly reduces monoterpene fluxes of Mediterranean Holm oak forest into the atmosphere due to a lack of primary substrates coming from photosynthetic processes.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7ee51f30e450fb111a08da32fdb386f0d67b36d1", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/mcm/WuDLZ13", "MAG": "2087051454", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mcm.2012.03.008", "CorpusId": 8101450}, "title": "A DEA-based approach for fair reduction and reallocation of emission permits", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "0c1de86bb710d10cfe2dbf91caa482a8869f0521", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972765316", "DOI": "10.1007/S12206-015-0147-5", "CorpusId": 108501139}, "title": "Economic assessment of greenhouse gas reduction through low-grade waste heat recovery using organic Rankine cycle (ORC)", "abstract": "Low-grade waste heat recovery technologies reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels and improve overall efficiency.

Biochar, a carbon-rich, porous pyrolysis product of organic residues may positively affect plant yield and can, owing to its inherent stability, promote soil carbon sequestration when amended to agricultural soils. Another possible effect of biochar is the reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). A number of laboratory incubations have shown significantly reduced N2O emissions from soil when mixed with biochar. Emission measurements under field conditions however are more scarce and show weaker or no reductions, or even increases in N2O emissions. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for reduced N2O emissions from soil is owing to the increase in soil pH following the application of alkaline biochar. To test the effect of biochar on N2O emissions in a temperate maize cropping system, we set up a field trial with a 20t ha\u22121 biochar treatment, a limestone treatment adjusted to the same pH as the biochar treatment (pH 6.5), and a control treatment without any addition (pH 6.1). An automated static chamber system measured N2O emissions for each replicate plot (n = 3) every 3.6 h over the course of 8 months. The field was conventionally fertilised at a rate of 160 kg N ha\u22121 in three applications of 40, 80 and 40 kg N ha\u22121 as ammonium nitrate. Cumulative N2O emissions were 52 % smaller in the biochar compared to the control treatment. However, the effect of the treatments overall was not statistically significant (p = 0.27) because of the large variability in the data set. Limed soils emitted similar mean cumulative amounts of N2O as the control.

The computational results demonstrate that the phenomenological soot model is capable of predicting the soot yield, particle diameter, and number density with satisfactory accuracy. Then the model was applied to investigate the influence of the orifice diameter and injection pressure on soot emissions in a constant-volume combustion vessel under typical diesel combustion conditions. The predictions showed qualitative agreement with the measurements on the soot volume fraction distribution. The results also indicate that the soot formation can almost be suppressed as the local equivalence ratio is kept lower than 2.0. Finally, the model was used to explore the potentials of soot reduction with HCCI combustion for diesel engines. The overall trend of soot with the variations in the start of injection timing was well reproduced by the model.

Three cooling levels were used.The ammonia emission was reduced at two of the levels and increased at one of the levels. The reductions in ammonia emission were explained by the cooling effect, but also by periodly low ambient temperatures. The study showed that cooling pig manure is an effective measure of reducing ammonia emissions.

In this article Richard Tol and Gary Yohe, while agreeing with some of the Review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions, disagree with some other points raised in the Review and they address six issues in particular: First, the Stern Review does not present new estimates of either the impacts of climate change or the costs of greenhouse gas emission reduction. Rather, the Stern Review reviews existing material. It is therefore surprising that the Stern Review produced numbers that are so far outside the range of the previous published literature. Second, the high valuation of climate change impacts reported in the Review can be explained by a very low discount rate, risk that is double-counted, and vulnerability that is assumed to be constant over very long periods of time (two or more centuries). The latter two sources of exaggeration are products of substandard analysis. The use of a very low discount rate is debatable. Third, the low estimates for the cost of climate change policy can be explained by the Review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truncating time horizon over which they are calculated, omitting the economic repercussions of dearer energy, and ignoring the capital invested in the energy sector. The first assumption is simply wrong, especially since the very low discount rates puts enormous weight on the other side of the calculus on impacts that might be felt after the year 2050. The latter two are misleading. Fourth, the cost and benefit estimates reported in the Stern Review do not match its policy conclusions. If the impacts of climate change are as dramatic as the Stern Review suggests, and if the costs of emission reduction are as small as reported, then a concentration target that is far more stringent than the one recommended in the Review should have been proposed. The Review, in fact, does not conduct a proper optimization exercise. Fifth, a strong case for emission reduction even in the near term can nonetheless be made without relying on suspect valuations and inappropriate summing across the multiple sources of climate risk. A corollary of this observation is that doing nothing in the short term is not advisable even on economic grounds. Sixth, alarmism supported by dubious economics born of the Stern Review may further polarize the climate policy debate. It will certainly allow opponents of near-term climate policy to focus the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention on the estimation errors and away from its more important messages: that climate risks are approaching more quickly than previously anticipated, that some sort of policy response will be required to diminish the likelihoods of the most serious of those risks, and that beginning now can be justified by economic arguments anchored on more reliable analysis. These six points are discussed in separate sections before the authors reach their conclusion.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "c7c1213653ec5a54ab9fd915f9723003a8f86eda", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2093309646", "DOI": "10.1068/A39255", "CorpusId": 39820314}, "title": "Using Economic Instruments to Address Emissions from Air Transport in the European Union", "abstract": "Air transport has become a vital component of the global economy. However, greenhouse-gas emissions from this sector have a significant impact on global climate, being responsible for over 3.5% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing. Also, the accrued visibility of aircraft emissions greatly affects the public image of the industry. In this context, incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or quantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures on demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimal\u2014mainly due to the high willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by the EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or if future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social cost of CO 2 as well as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these policies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO 2 emissions in the EU is estimated, both in physical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25, the total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region\u2019s GDP. It is concluded that the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air transport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However, the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such as policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is also attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of their own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "fee7dc91567b80e397aaaa01b80e08a6ea032cbb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2084306403", "DOI": "10.1161/01.CIR.65.4.731", "CorpusId": 13446931, "PubMed": "7060253"}, "title": "Effect of Flow\u2010Independent Reduction of Metabolism on Regional Myocardial Clearance of 11C\u2010Palmitate", "abstract": "Recent studies with sequential positron-emission tomography have demonstrated that early clearance of activity from myocardium after i.v. carbon-11 (11C)-palmitate is decreased in regions of ischemia.

In 21 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was cannulated and perfused by an extracorporal bypass system. In each dog two regional time-activity curves (90 minutes apart) were recorded with a \u03b2-detector probe after intracoronary injection of 11C-palmitate. In control dogs (n = 7), no intervention was imposed between the two studies. In the experimental dogs, oxygen supply was reduced 15 minutes before the second injection of 11Cpalmitate by either reducing LAD flow by an average of 76% (ischemia group, n = 7) or by perfusing the LAD bed at normal flow rate with venous blood, resulting in an average reduction in oxygen content of 66% (hypoxia group, n = 7). Myocardial blood flow in the LAD-perfused region determined based on washout of H2150 did not change in either'the control or hypoxia group, but decreased by an average of 64% (p< 0.025) in the ischemia group. Similarly, 11C clearance rates did not change from the first to the second study in control dogs. However, the, 11C clearance rate was reduced by an average of 52% with hypoxia despite maintenance of flow (p < 0.02) as well as by ischemia itself (61%, p < 0.005). Thus, clearance of 11C-activity after extraction of 11C-palmitate by myocardium is consistently reduced in regions rendered hypoxic despite persistence of perfusion, supporting the hypothesis that the metabolic attenuation induced by hypoxia or ischemia per se can be detected in patients based on sequential and quantitative analysis'of regional time-activity curves obtained by positron-emission tomography.", "year": 1982}, {"paperId": "6d5c89755dbd313e81c43cf7fd0214219cc6962d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2136152134", "DOI": "10.1146/ANNUREV.ENERGY.26.1.49", "CorpusId": 154727223}, "title": "INDICATORS OF ENERGY USE AND CARBON EMISSIONS: Explaining the Energy Economy Link", "abstract": "\u25aa Abstract\u2002This article reviews energy indicators, which are developed to describe the links between energy use and human activity in a disaggregated manner.

Positron emission tomography.", "abstract": "Using position emission tomography (PET) and equilibrium imaging with oxygen-15 labelled gases, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and oxygen consumption rate (CMRO2) were measured in multiple regions of interest over the cerebral cortex of 5 control subjects, 4 patients with strictly unilateral longstanding carotid artery occlusion, 1 patient with middle cerebral artery embolic stroke in the acute stage, and 4 patients with subcortical stroke and no cervical arterial disease. In each control subject, the regional CBV was linearly and positively correlated with both CBF and CMRO2, while the local mean transit time (t = CBV/CBF) was uniformly distributed, reflecting the local adaptation of both the vascular tone and the capillary density to the metabolic demand at constant cerebral perfusion pressure that characterizes the normal brain. In patients with subcortical stroke, cortical blood volume was reduced in proportion to the matched reduction in CBF and CMRO2, suggesting that the metabolic depression resulting from cortical deafferentation increases the resting tone of pial vessels. Unilateral carotid occlusion induced larger CBV and t, and steeper slopes of the CBV-CBF relationship, particularly on the occluded but also on the patent side. The assessment of the local cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as judged by the ratio CBF/CBV in 3 patients with focally raised OEF and preserved or reduced CMRO2, allowed the demonstration in multiple cerebral regions of single patients of two well-known physiological phenomena: the autoregulation of CBF, followed by the rise of the OEF as local CPP falls further. In addition, the depression of CMRO2 in the ischaemic cortex was associated with a trend for CBV to return towards normal values, compared with the maximally elevated CBV found in oligaemic but metabolically normal areas. This suggests that a process of metabolic vasoconstriction may participate, among other factors, in the vascular collapse that occurs, and would serve to regenerate some haemodynamic reserve, at very low CPP levels.", "year": 1989}, {"paperId": "c0dc6e485a400be736f7c66cf80f53ebd60fafca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "80034397", "DOI": "10.1021/J100359A035", "CorpusId": 92288296}, "title": "Sandwich colloids of zinc oxide and zinc sulfide in aqueous solutions", "abstract": "Colloid particles, composed of ZnO and ZnS particles in contact or ZnO colloid particles coated with ZnS, have been investigated.

However, very little is known about banana\u2019s contribution to global warming. The aims of this work were to study the greenhouse gas emissions of bananas from cradle to retail and cradle to grave and to assess the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along the value chain.MethodsCarbon footprint methodology based on ISO-DIS 14067 was used to assess GHG emissions from 1\u00a0kg of bananas produced at two plantations in Costa Rica including transport by cargo ship to Norway. Several methodological issues are not clearly addressed in ISO 14067 or the LCA standards 14040 and ISO 14044 underpinning 14067. Examples are allocation, allocation in recycling, representativity and system borders. Methodological choices in this study have been made based on other standards, such as the GHG Protocol Products Standard.Results and discussionThe results indicate that bananas had a carbon footprint (CF) on the same level as other tropical fruits and that the contribution from the primary production stage was low. However, the methodology used in this study and the other comparative studies was not necessarily identical; hence, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Overseas transport and primary production were the main contributors to the total GHG emissions. Including the consumer stage resulted in a 34\u00a0% rise in CF, mainly due to high wastage. The main potential reductions of GHG emissions were identified at the primary production, within the overseas transport stage and at the consumer.ConclusionsThe carbon footprint of bananas from cradle to retail was 1.37\u00a0kg CO2 per kilogram banana. GHG emissions from transport and primary production could be significantly reduced, which could theoretically give a reduction of as much as 44\u00a0% of the total cradle-to-retail CF. The methodology was important for the end result. The choice of system boundaries gives very different results depending on which life cycle stages and which unit processes are included. Allocation issues were also important, both in recycling and in other processes such as transport and storage. The main uncertainties of the CF result are connected to N2O emissions from agriculture, methane emissions from landfills, use of secondary data and variability in the primary production data. Thus, there is a need for an internationally agreed calculation method for bananas and other food products if CFs are to be used for comparative purposes.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "1b0ae09dd60f70375453a24c74f75ea422459d60", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2041185392", "DOI": "10.1097/00006231-200503000-00003", "CorpusId": 42740723, "PubMed": "15722899"}, "title": "Emission tomography in dementia.", "abstract": "Dementia is a chronic brain syndrome with enormous impact on health care provision. Emission tomography (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)) provides a unique tool to investigate functional and neurochemical changes, both in those with established dementia and in those at risk of subsequent cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by bilateral temporoparietal hypoperfusion on SPECT and hypometabolism on PET, which may precede the onset of dementia as similar changes can be demonstrated in those with mild cognitive impairment and in those genetically at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In dementia with Lewy bodies medial parietal and occipital perfusion deficits are seen together with pre-synaptic and post-synaptic dopaminergic changes, most particularly a reduction in the striatal pre-synaptic dopamine transporter which can be visualized using appropriate ligands (e.g., (123)I-FP-CIT). Vascular dementia is associated with multiple, asymmetric, perfusion deficits in multi-infarct dementia. In contrast, subcortical vascular dementia is associated with reduced perfusion but preserved oxygen extraction fraction on PET. Fronto-temporal dementia is characterized by both hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in fronto-temporal lobes, though hypometabolism appears more extensive, affecting large areas of the cerebral hemispheres. Longitudinal studies of treatment response in Alzheimer's disease with cholinergic drugs have found changes in regional blood flow and nicotinic and muscarinic receptor function in those patients who respond to treatment.

The light-induced spectral changes from orange-red sharp line emission to yellow-white broad band are observed in Sr2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu at room temperature under irradiation with short UV or X-rays. The spectral changes are attributed to the optically assisted reduction of Eu3+ \n \u2192 Eu2+. The photoreduced Sr2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu shows emission containing contributions from both Eu2+ and Eu3+ in comparison to chemically reduced samples. This is explained on the basis of preferential reduction of Eu3+ present in Sr(1) sites under irradiation due to unsatisfied EuSr\u2013O\u2013Si bonds. The absence of photoactivity for Ba2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu3+ \n (space group = \n Pnam) as well as Ca2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu3+ \n (space group = \n P21/n) indicates that crystal structure plays an important role in the photoreduction of Sr2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu3+ because of the prevailing orientational as well as the positional disorder in the latter. Further, the orientationally disordered monoclinic random domains persist within the orthorhombic lattice of Sr2SiO4, resulting in the positionally disordered Sr atoms and orientationally disordered SiO4 tetrahedra. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies confirm the electron trapping by dynamically disordered (SiO4)4\u2212 under high energy photon illumination resulting in the formation of radical anion (SiO4)5\u2212. The substitutional studies indicate that the [Eu3+ \n \u2190 O2\u2212] charge-transfer (CT) state is directly involved in the photoreduction process. The excitation of Sr2SiO4 \n \u2236 Eu3+ produces the [Eu3+ \n \u2190 O2\u2212] CT state which relaxes and transfers electrons to SiO4 groups due to optically assisted rearrangement of local environment and mediates the electron transfer process to cause photoreduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+. The yellow emission is stable at room temperature and reverts to red on annealing at elevated temperature in Ar atmosphere due to thermally activated detrapping of charge carriers present at the defect centers which, in turn, convert Eu2+ to Eu3+. The thermally activated conversion of Eu2+ \n \u2192 Eu3+ in Sr2SiO4 is optically reversible, thereby resulting in a highly efficient material for application as an optical storage medium.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "1209f643a92e981c2199a582f1a16803997e9f36", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2092461590", "DOI": "10.1007/S12053-012-9159-5", "CorpusId": 154857549}, "title": "Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in Swedish manufacturing industries", "abstract": "This paper analyses the trends in energy consumption and CO2 emissions as a result of energy efficiency improvements in Swedish manufacturing industries between 1993 and 2008.

It was found that energy consumption, energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity, measured as production values, have decreased significantly in the Swedish manufacturing industries during the period studied.

When the MEP pathway was blocked by fosmidomycin and volatile isoprenoid emission was largely suppressed, leaf ABA content decreased to about 50% and leaf stomatal conductance increased significantly. No effect of fosmidomycin was seen in leaves with constitutively high rates of stomatal conductance and in plant species with low foliar ABA concentration. In all other cases, isoprene emission was directly associated with foliar ABA, but ABA reduction upon MEP pathway inhibition was also observed in plant species that do not emit isoprenoids. Stomatal closure causing a midday depression of photosynthesis was also associated with a concurrent increase of isoprene emission and ABA content. It is suggested that the MEP pathway generates a labile pool of ABA that responds rapidly to environmental changes. This pool also regulates stomatal conductance, possibly when coping with frequent changes of water availability. MEP pathway inhibition by leaf darkening, and its down-regulation by exposure to elevated CO2, was also associated with a reduction of foliar ABA content. However, stomatal conductance was reduced, indicating that stomatal aperture is not regulated by the MEP-dependent foliar ABA pool, under these specific cases.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "d935b9ad5451a1282514a0c00b21ee3664ca8515", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2342371998", "CorpusId": 168158150}, "title": "The final policy scenarios of the EU Clean Air Policy Package", "abstract": "Acknowledgements This report was produced under the negotiated procedure to extend contract # Disclaimer The views and opinions expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent the positions of IIASA or its collaborating and supporting organizations.

Executive Summary This report documents the key scenarios that informed the discussion and decision of the college of the European Commission on the Clean Air Policy package. Based on the PRIMES\u20102013 Reference scenario and the associated CAPRI projections of agricultural activities, the GAINS model has been used to explore the potential for environmental improvements offered by emission control measures that are not yet part of current legislation. Compared to the baseline projection in 2025, full application of readily available technical emission reduction measures in the EU could reduce health impacts from PM by another 30% and thereby gain more than 60 million life\u2010years in the EU. It could save another 2,800 premature deaths per year because of lower ozone concentrations. Further controls of agricultural emissions could protect biodiversity at another 200,000 km 2 of ecosystems against excess nitrogen deposition, including 90,000 km 2 of Natura2000 areas and other protected zones. It could eliminate almost all likely exceedances of the air quality limit values for NO 2 , and for PM10 values in the old Member States. It is estimated that the full implementation of all the measures that achieve the above\u2010mentioned benefits would involve in 2025 additional emission control costs of approximately 47 billion \u20ac/yr (0.3% of GDP), compared to 88 billion \u20ac/yr (0.6%) that are spent under current legislation. The report examines interim environmental targets that could serve for 2025 as milestones towards the long\u2010term objective of the EU Environment Action Programme. In a most conservative perspective, considering monetized benefits only for human health and using the low valuation of the value of a lost life year (VOLY), net benefits are maximized at a 76% 'gap closure' between the current legislation baseline and the maximum feasible emission reductions. At this level, emission reduction costs (on top of current legislation) amount to 4.5 billion \u20ac/yr, while benefits from these measures are estimated at 44 billion \u20ac/yr. The European Commission reached a final agreement on a slightly lower gap closure level (70%) for health effects for the new Clean Air Programme for Europe.

Although there may be calibration problems with the observations, uncertainties in model estimates of preindustrial natural emissions must also be considered.

Reduction in the preindustrial lightning source accounts for two thirds of the increase in the ozone forcing. Because there is near-total titration of OH by isoprene in the continental boundary layer of the preindustrial atmosphere, isoprene and other biogenic hydrocarbons represent significant ozone sinks.

High efficiency biomass to electricity systems were found to be the conversion technology offering the greatest C emission reduction potential.

The source attributions for mass concentration, haze formation, transport and direct radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) in various regions of China are quantified in this study using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a source-tagging technique. Anthropogenic emissions are from the Community Emissions Data System that is newly developed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Over north China where the air quality is often poor, about 90\u202f% of near-surface BC concentration is contributed by local emissions. Overall, 35\u202f% of BC concentration over south China in winter can be attributed to emissions from north China, and 19\u202f% comes from sources outside China in spring. For other regions in China, BC is largely contributed from nonlocal sources. We further investigated potential factors that contribute to the poor air quality in China. During polluted days, a net inflow of BC transported from nonlocal source regions associated with anomalous winds plays an important role in increasing local BC concentrations. BC-containing particles emitted from East Asia can also be transported across the Pacific. Our model results show that emissions from inside and outside China are equally important for the BC outflow from East Asia, while emissions from China account for 8\u202f% of BC concentration and 29\u202f% in column burden in the western United States in spring. Radiative forcing estimates show that 65\u202f% of the annual mean BC direct radiative forcing (2.2\u202fW\u202fm\u22122) in China results from local emissions, and the remaining 35\u202f% is contributed by emissions outside of China.

The results show that viscosities of B10 and B20 are closer to diesel. Moreover, only the oxidation stability of B10 and B20 meet the European specifications (EN 590) of 20 h. Therefore, only B10 and B20 have been used to evaluate engine performance and emission. Compared to B0, the average reduction in brake power (BP) is 4.67% for B10 and 8.86% for B20. It was observed that brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases as the percentage of biodiesel increase. Compared to B0, a reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) emission of 3.84% and 10.25% and carbon monoxide (CO) emission of 16% and 25% was reported using B10 and B20.

This study reports how the expansion of sugarcane in Brazil during 1996\u20132006 affected indicators for environment, land use and economy. The results indicate that sugarcane expansion did not in general contribute to direct deforestation in the traditional agricultural region where most of the expansion took place. The amount of forests on farmland in this area is below the minimum stated in law and the situation did not change over the studied period. Sugarcane expansion resulted in a significant reduction of pastures and cattle heads and higher economic growth than in neighboring areas. It could not be established to what extent the discontinuation of cattle production induced expansion of pastures in other areas, possibly leading to indirect deforestation. However, the results indicate that a possible migration of the cattle production reached further than the neighboring of expansion regions.

North American leaders recently committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, but information on current emissions from upstream oil and gas developments in Canada are lacking. This study examined the occurrence of methane plumes in an area of unconventional natural gas development in northwestern Canada. In August to September 2015 we completed almost 8000\u202fkm of vehicle-based survey campaigns on public roads dissecting oil and gas infrastructure, such as well pads and processing facilities. We surveyed six routes 3\u20136 times each, which brought us past over 1600 unique well pads and facilities managed by more than 50 different operators. To attribute on-road plumes to oil- and gas-related sources we used gas signatures of residual excess concentrations (anomalies above background) less than 500\u202fm downwind from potential oil and gas emission sources. All results represent emissions greater than our minimum detection limit of 0.59\u202fg\u202fs\u22121 at our average detection distance (319\u202fm). Unlike many other oil and gas developments in the US for which methane measurements have been reported recently, the methane concentrations we measured were close to normal atmospheric levels, except inside natural gas plumes. Roughly 47\u202f% of active wells emitted methane-rich plumes above our minimum detection limit. Multiple sites that pre-date the recent unconventional natural gas development were found to be emitting, and we observed that the majority of these older wells were associated with emissions on all survey repeats. We also observed emissions from gas processing facilities that were highly repeatable. Emission patterns in this area were best explained by infrastructure age and type. Extrapolating our results across all oil and gas infrastructure in the Montney area, we estimate that the emission sources we located (emitting at a rate >\u202f0.59\u202fg\u202fs\u22121) contribute more than 111\u202f800\u202ft of methane annually to the atmosphere. This value exceeds reported bottom-up estimates of 78\u202f000\u202ft of methane for all oil and gas sector sources in British Columbia. Current bottom-up methods for estimating methane emissions do not normally calculate the fraction of emitting oil and gas infrastructure with thorough on-ground measurements. However, this study demonstrates that mobile surveys could provide a more accurate representation of the number of emission sources in an oil and gas development.

Emissions of the four metals in the beginning of the 1990s were as low as in the 1950s, which we attribute to the economic downturn in industry, changes in technology for an increasing metal recovery from ores, the replacement of coal and oil by gas, and air pollution control.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "831142199ba26dc04627ba5e09bb58fe0b6f455a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2091977576", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.61.4.427", "CorpusId": 22624556, "PubMed": "21516938"}, "title": "Regulated and Unregulated Emissions from Highway Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines Complying with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007 Emissions Standards", "abstract": "ABSTRACT As part of the Advanced Collaborative Emissions Study (ACES), regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions from four different 2007 model year U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-compliant heavy-duty highway diesel engines were measured on an engine dynamometer. The engines were equipped with exhaust high-efficiency catalyzed diesel particle filters (C-DPFs) that are actively regenerated or cleaned using the engine control module. Regulated emissions of carbon monoxide, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (PM) were on average 97, 89, and 86% lower than the 2007 EPA standard, respectively, and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were on average 9% lower. Unregulated exhaust emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions were on average 1.3 and 2.8 times higher than the NO2 emissions reported in previous work using 1998- and 2004-technology engines, respectively. However, compared with other work performed on 1994- to 2004-technology engines, average emission reductions in the range of 71\u201399% were observed for a very comprehensive list of unregulated engine exhaust pollutants and air toxic contaminants that included metals and other elements, elemental carbon (EC), inorganic ions, and gas- and particle-phase volatile and semi-volatile organic carbon (OC) compounds. The low PM mass emitted from the 2007 technology ACES engines was composed mainly of sulfate (53%) and OC (30%), with a small fraction of EC (13%) and metals and other elements (4%). The fraction of EC is expected to remain small, regardless of engine operation, because of the presence of the high-efficiency C-DPF in the exhaust. This is different from typical PM composition of pre-2007 engines with EC in the range of 10\u201390%, depending on engine operation. Most of the particles emitted from the 2007 engines were mainly volatile nuclei mode in the sub-30-nm size range. An increase in volatile nanoparticles was observed during C-DPF active regeneration, during which the observed particle number was similar to that observed in emissions of pre-2007 engines. However, on average, when combining engine operation with and without active regeneration events, particle number emissions with the 2007 engines were 90% lower than the particle number emitted from a 2004-technology engine tested in an earlier program. IMPLICATIONS To meet the 2007 EPA heavy-duty highway PM emissions standard, engine manufacturers have elected to equip engine exhaust with a high-efficiency C-DPF. Because of the use of the C-DPF, the PM emissions were 86% below the 2007 standard, and many unregulated gas and particle-phase emissions compounds were substantially lower than those emitted from pre-2007-technology engines. Signifi-cant air quality benefits can be expected as the C-DPF technology, or other equivalent technology, continues to be applied to future highway engines and to other nonroad and stationary diesel engines.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "2d8aab9483a2fd1335c355c8dff2299b79e1d332", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2226500478", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2015.12.016", "CorpusId": 110070449}, "title": "Differences in regional emissions in China's transport sector: Determinants and reduction strategies", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b24d75dc906bdcdc32ac4bbdc7700729226f3be3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2031916095", "DOI": "10.1051/agro:2008013", "CorpusId": 24668978}, "title": "Algorithm for estimating the crop height effect on ammonia emission from slurry applied to cereal fields and grassland", "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) emission following the application of livestock slurry to agricultural land is a significant source of atmospheric NH3, and not only poses a risk to the environment through eutrophication and acidification of sensitive ecosystems, but may also result in a loss of plant-available nitrogen (N). The band-spread slurry application technologies of trailing hose and trailing shoe have been shown to reduce NH3 emissions and consequently to increase plant uptake of slurry-applied N. There is a need to improve the precision in calculating the reduction in NH3 emission nationally and at farm level, and this may be achieved through the development of algorithms that more accurately estimate NH3 emission and also support the assessment of fertilizer efficiency of slurry that is band-applied to crops. Therefore, this study reviewed studies of NH3 emission from slurry band applied with a trailing hose or shoe with the objective of developing an algorithm for calculating the reduction efficiency of the band application technique in relation to crop height. The developed algorithm predicted that for slurry applications to cereal crops, the reduction efficiency would increase by slightly less than 1% for every 1 cm increase in crop height. For slurry application to grassland, the reduction efficiency was predicted to increase by approximately 5% for every 1 cm increase in sward height. The developed algorithm was used in combination with the ALFAM model, which predicts NH3 emission from slurry applications to bare soil, to provide monthly coefficients for estimating NH3 emission from slurry applied to bare soil, cereal crops and grassland for Denmark and Southern England. Inclusion of the crop height algorithm in the emission factor derivation predicted, for example, a decrease in the emission factor for cattle slurry application by trailing hose to winter wheat from c. 25% to c. 15% of applied ammoniacal N for applications in January and May, respectively. While the algorithm developed in this study would benefit from wider validation, should more published data become available, the present paper demonstrates its potential value as an educational tool for farmers and advisers in developing more sustainable manure management strategies and for inclusion in emission factor calculations for national inventories to both improve the temporal distribution of emissions from slurry application and to better reflect improved management practices of farmers.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d089f34531bc1a9a8af1f50590ae50044ac35908", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2146892597", "DBLP": "journals/tmi/DefriseKTMSN97", "DOI": "10.1109/42.563660", "CorpusId": 11735745, "PubMed": "9101324"}, "title": "Exact and approximate rebinning algorithms for 3-D PET data", "abstract": "This paper presents two new rebinning algorithms for the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3-D) positron emission tomography (PET) data. A rebinning algorithm is one that first sorts the 3-D data into an ordinary two-dimensional (2-D) data set containing one sinogram for each transaxial slice to be reconstructed; the 3-D image is then recovered by applying to each slice a 2-D reconstruction method such as filtered-backprojection. This approach allows a significant speedup of 3-D reconstruction, which is particularly useful for applications involving dynamic acquisitions or whole-body imaging. The first new algorithm is obtained by discretizing an exact analytical inversion formula. The second algorithm, called the Fourier rebinning algorithm (FORE), is approximate but allows an efficient implementation based on taking 2-D Fourier transforms of the data. This second algorithm was implemented and applied to data acquired with the new generation of PET systems and also to simulated data for a scanner with an 18/spl deg/ axial aperture. The reconstructed images were compared to those obtained with the 3-D reprojection algorithm (3DRP) which is the standard \"exact\" 3-D filtered-backprojection method. Results demonstrate that FORE provides a reliable alternative to 3DRP, while at the same time achieving an order of magnitude reduction in processing time.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "72106436bdb4cb87539b7337df3b852ce4b46333", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1995357823", "DOI": "10.1021/EF800492R", "CorpusId": 95646337}, "title": "Performance and Emissions of a Diesel Engine Fuelled with Methanol", "abstract": "Methanol and diesel are not very miscible, which makes it difficult to mix them together as a diesel engine fuel.
