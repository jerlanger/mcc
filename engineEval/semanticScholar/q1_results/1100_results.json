Patients were classified as major responders by serial FDG-PET when the post-CRT PET demonstrated a strong reduction of FDG uptake at the primary tumour site (>80% reduction of tumour-to-liver uptake ratio) without any abnormal FDG uptake elsewhere in the body. PET response was compared with histology obtained during post-induction transthoracic oesophagectomy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA strong correlation was found between the extent of lymph node (LN) involvement as shown by the pre-CRT PET and the major response rate (P = 0.001): such response occurred in nine of 11 N0M0 patients (82%), in three of nine N(1-2)M0 patients (33%) and in two of 16 patients (13%) with distant lymphatic spread. Such a correlation was not found for computed tomography or endoscopic ultrasonography. The sensitivity of serial FDG-PET for a major CRT response was 10 of 14 (71%), its specificity 18 of 22 (82%). The concordance between the response assessment by PET and histopathology was 78%. The median survival time after CRT of PET major responders compared with PET non-major responders was 16.3 months and 6.4 months, respectively.

The implementation of emission reductions during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit provides a valuable opportunity to study air pollution in Beijing. From 15 October to 30 November 2014, the height of the atmospheric mixing layer and the vertical attenuated backscattering coefficient profiles were observed online using a~lidar ceilometer. Compared with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, the attenuated backscattering coefficients measured by the lidar ceilometer were strongly correlated with the PM2.5 concentration and AOD (correlation coefficients of 0.89 and 0.86, respectively). This result demonstrated the reliability of the vertical distribution of particles measured by the lidar ceilometer. By classifying different degrees of air pollution based on visibility, we found that during the transition period of air pollution, which was affected by transport of southerly flows in the mixing layer, the attenuated backscattering coefficient from 0 to 1500 m was enhanced by approximately 1.4 Mm\u22121 sr\u22121 (140 %). During the polluted period, the attenuated backscattering coefficient from 0 to 300 m suddenly increased, and the coefficient near the surface peaked (approximately 14 Mm\u22121 sr\u22121); however, the attenuated backscattering coefficient from 300 to 900 m decreased gradually, and the average value from 0 to 1500 m decreased by 0.5 Mm\u22121sr\u22121 (20 %). The height of the mixing layer gradually decreased, and the ratio of CO / SO2 gradually increased, which indicate that the polluted period was dominated by local contribution.

The soils are Lismore stony silt loam (Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal) and Templeton fine sandy loam (Udic Haplustepts).

Source-receptor matrices, which quantify the transboundary transport between the European countries, are presented. The temporal evolution of exceedances of the critical loads have also been analysed. The present (1995) emission and deposition levels are also presented. The database utilized in this study is the one presently employed under the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The emission data reported to EMEP indicate that the European sulphur emissions declined by approximately 50% during the period 1980\u20131995. Larger reductions were found in the area of the Former Soviet Union and western Europe than in central eastern Europe. For oxidized and reduced nitrogen the overall European reductions were approximately 15% from 1980 to 1995. Both oxidized and reduced nitrogen emissions fell more in eastern Europe than in western Europe. The corresponding declines in total deposition to all grid cells in the the EMEP domain have been calculated with a two-dimensional trajectory model for the period 1985\u20131995. The percent reductions were 34, 9 and 12% for sulphur, oxidized and reduced nitrogen, respectively. The deposition reductions are 5, 1 and 6% smaller than the emission reductions during this period for sulphur, oxidized and reduced nitrogen. We have further found that the total area affected by exceedances of acidifying sulphur and nitrogen was about 20% in the mid eighties, but it has dropped to approximately 10% in 1995. The area affected by exceedances of eutrophying nitrogen has, on the other hand, remained approximately at a little less than 30% throughout the whole period. The reductions in the total area of exceedance are consistent with the emission trends. The two-dimensional trajectory model has also been used to derive source-receptor matrices for the European countries for the period 1985\u20131995. The matrices clearly show that the atmospheric transport over distances of 1000\u20132000 km are very significant in particular for sulphur and oxidized nitrogen, and many countries in Europe receive most of the acidifying compounds from emissions in other countries.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "61bf833766161ede08aac51fee001efdcbdaaed8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2346627226", "DOI": "10.1038/NCLIMATE2998", "CorpusId": 88203349}, "title": "New use of global warming potentials to compare cumulative and short-lived climate pollutants", "abstract": "Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have requested guidance on common greenhouse gas metrics in accounting for Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to emission reductions1.

These technologies must be able to capture nutrients, kill pathogens, and reduce emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nuisance odors from manure. To meet these needs, a wastewater treatment plant was demonstrated at full-scale in one of two 4,360-pig production units on a finishing farm in Duplin County, North Carolina. The treatment system installed in the first production unit combined new treatment technologies consisting of solid-liquid separation with removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the liquid phase. The second production unit was used as a control to evaluate emission improvements using traditional anaerobic lagoon technology. Both production units had similar production management and lagoons with similar surface area (about 0.9 ha each) and wastewater design. As the treatment system recovered the manure solids and replaced the anaerobic lagoon liquid with cleaner water, it converted the anaerobic lagoon into a treated water pond. Our objective was to study changes in NH3 emissions as a result of improved water quality. The study was done one year after lagoon conversion into aerated pond as a result of manure treatment and included cold and warm weather conditions. Passive flux samplers were used to measure NH3 gas fluxes from both lagoon systems. Average total ammoniacal N (TAN) concentrations in lagoon liquid were 31 and 388 mg/L for the treated and traditional systems, respectively. We found that free NH3 (FA) concentration, which integrates TAN, temperature, and pH into a single factor, explained 90% of the variation in NH3 emissions from these lagoon systems. Lower N concentrations in the converted lagoon substantially reduced annual NH3 emissions by 90% with respect to those found in the traditional anaerobic lagoon. Ammonia emissions from the converted lagoon totaled 1,210 kg N/lagoon/year (or 1,311 kg N/ha/year). This annual rate compares with NH3 emissions of 12,540 kg N/lagoon/year (13,633 kg N/ha/year) from the traditional lagoon.

We conducted the first methane emission measurements from abandoned oil and gas wells and found substantial emissions, particularly from high-emitting abandoned wells. These emissions are not currently considered in any emissions inventory. We scaled methane emissions from our direct measurements of abandoned wells in Pennsylvania and calculate that they represent 4\u20137% of current total anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. Millions of abandoned wells exist across the country and some are likely to be high emitters. Additional measurements of methane emissions from abandoned wells and their inclusion in greenhouse gas inventories will aid in developing and implementing appropriate greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies. Abandoned oil and gas wells provide a potential pathway for subsurface migration and emissions of methane and other fluids to the atmosphere. Little is known about methane fluxes from the millions of abandoned wells that exist in the United States. Here, we report direct measurements of methane fluxes from abandoned oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania, using static flux chambers. A total of 42 and 52 direct measurements were made at wells and at locations near the wells (\u201ccontrols\u201d) in forested, wetland, grassland, and river areas in July, August, October 2013 and January 2014, respectively. The mean methane flow rates at these well locations were 0.27 kg/d/well, and the mean methane flow rate at the control locations was 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 kg/d/location. Three out of the 19 measured wells were high emitters that had methane flow rates that were three orders of magnitude larger than the median flow rate of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 kg/d/well. Assuming the mean flow rate found here is representative of all abandoned wells in Pennsylvania, we scaled the methane emissions to be 4\u20137% of estimated total anthropogenic methane emissions in Pennsylvania. The presence of ethane, propane, and n-butane, along with the methane isotopic composition, indicate that the emitted methane is predominantly of thermogenic origin.

Results show that changes in per capita GDP and GDP composition led to increased emissions which offset the reduction of emissions made possible by technology-induced decrease of mercury emissions intensity and changes in final demand mix. In particular, changes in final demand mix caused decreasing mercury emissions from 1992 to 2002 and increasing emissions from 2002 to 2007.

Many CO 2 reduction options have been proposed in literature for both sectors. They are mainly focused on CO 2 capture in power plants, but, in the short\u2010term, industrial processes are going to play an important role in achieving this objective. In particular, one of the disadvantages in cement plants is that CO 2 has two sources: fuel combustion and lime calcination. For this reason, proposed solutions could partially reduce a limited quantity of emissions. The sector is forced to use CO 2 capture systems for further reductions. Preliminary results about the implementation of post\u2010combustion and oxyfuel combustion systems for CO 2 capture show low energetic penalties and important emissions reduction. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis, not only of CO 2 emissions, but of raw materials and its disposal, primary energy and waste energy, could give optimum results from an environmental, energetic, and economic perspective. The combination/integration by industrial symbiosis of a power plant, a cement plant and a CO 2 capture system is proposed in this work. Calcium\u2010looping is chosen as the most suitable CO 2 capture option for this application. The re\u2010use of waste CaO coming from CO 2 capture in the cement plant, and the utilization of waste energy from a clinker cooling and capture system to produce additional power are the main advantages of this proposal. Process flow diagrams and heat and mass balances are calculated and presented in this work. Results show a low value of the CO 2 avoided cost, 12.4 \u20ac/t, that is smaller than in any other combination of power plant with capture system or cement plant plus capture system, making this proposal economically very attractive.

This is performed using common and comparable boundary conditions including net CO2 sequestered based on equivalent boundary conditions. This is achieved using a 'cradle to grave approach' where the final destination and fate of any product is considered. The input boundary is pure CO2 that has been produced using a post-combustion capture process as this is common between all processes. The output boundary is the emissions resulting from any product produced with the assumption that the majority of the oil will go to combustion processes. We also consider the 'cradle to gate' approach where the ultimate fate of the oil is not considered as this is a boundary condition often applied to EHR processes.

The GHG Emissions Impacts of Consuming Imported versus Domestically Produced Food", "abstract": "With the increased interest in the \u2018carbon footprint\u2019 of global economic activities, civil society, governments and the private sector are calling into question the wisdom of transporting food products across continents instead of consuming locally produced food. While the proposition that local consumption will reduce one\u2019s carbon footprint may seem obvious at first glance, this conclusion is not at all clear when one considers that the economic emissions intensity of food production varies widely across regions. In this paper we concentrate on the tradeoff between production and transport emissions reductions by testing the following hypothesis: Substitution of domestic for imported food will reduce the direct and indirect Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with consumption. We focus on ruminant livestock since it has the highest emissions intensity across food sectors, but we also consider other food products as well, and alternately perturb the mix of domestic and imported food products by a marginal (equal) amount. We then compare the emissions associated with each of these consumption changes in order to compute a marginal emissions intensity of local food consumption, by country and product. The variations in regional ruminant emissions intensities have profound implications for the food miles debate. While shifting consumption patterns in wealthy countries from imported to domestic livestock products reduces GHG emissions associated with international trade and transport activity, we find that these transport emissions reductions are swamped by changes in global emissions due to differences in GHG emissions intensities of production. Therefore, diverting consumption to local goods only reduces global emissions when undertaken in regions with relatively low emissions intensities. For non-ruminant products, the story is more nuanced. Transport costs are more important in the case of dairy products and vegetable oils. Overall, domestic emissions intensities are the dominant part of the food miles story in about 90\u00a0% of the country/commodity cases examined here.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b3bd7bf750eefb6d1dd73ff6f38da4e56cd7361d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147393791", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1467-7660.2009.01618.X", "CorpusId": 154286548}, "title": "Socially sustainable economic de-growth.", "abstract": "Economic growth is not compatible with environmental sustainability.

Primary sources of CO2 emission on dairy farms are soil, plant, and animal respiration, with smaller contributions from microbial respiration in manure. Strategies designed to reduce emissions from one source can cause an increase in emissions from another source. Therefore, a comprehensive whole-farm evaluation is needed, which can be cost-effectively met through computer simulation. The Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM), a process-based whole-farm model, was extended to simulate the carbon cycle. Relationships were added to represent photosynthetic fixation, soil and plant respiration, animal respiration, and emissions from manure storage and barn floors. The new module was verified to predict the mass of carbon present in soil pools at the end of annual simulations and to predict CO2 emissions within expected emission ranges for both specific sources and overall farm emissions. A farm-level carbon balance was used to further verify that predicted emissions were reasonable across a variety of production strategies. Farm simulations illustrated that changes in cropping practices affected emissions from all farm sources, with a primary effect on the assimilation of CO2 in feed production. For a representative farm in central Pennsylvania, use of more alfalfa in place of corn production caused a 6% increase in net farm greenhouse gas emission in CO2-equivalent units, while replacing non-permanent grassland with corn production reduced the net emission by 16%. Changing from a Holstein herd to Jersey animals with animal numbers increased to produce the same amount of milk affected most emission sources, with a net impact of increasing the net greenhouse gas emission by 20%.

Stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450 and 550\u00a0ppm CO2-e requires a dramatic reduction of carbon emissions compared to baseline levels. Mitigation pathways for the 450 CO2-e target are largely overlapping with the 550 CO2-e pathways in the first half of the century, and the lower level is achieved through rapid reductions in atmospheric concentrations in the second half of the century aided by negative anthropogenic carbon flows. A fragmented scenario designed to extrapolate current levels of ambition into the future falls short of the emissions reductions required under the harmonized targets.

Using multiple regression and path analysis, these effects of regulation are apparent even when controlling for changes in economic activity, economic infrastructure, and fuel consumption, enabling us to conclude that in air pollution control, regulation does matter.", "year": 1993}, {"paperId": "55ed510d921a697552289fa0073d14f7c1a72059", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2768724113", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-008-9447-4", "CorpusId": 17665897}, "title": "Decision making under catastrophic risk and learning: the case of the possible collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet", "abstract": "A collapse of the West-Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) would cause a sea level rise of 5\u20136\u00a0m, perhaps even within 100\u00a0years, with catastrophic consequences. The probability of such a collapse is small but increasing with the rise of the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas and the resulting climate change. This paper investigates how the potential collapse of the WAIS affects the optimal rate of greenhouse gas emission control. We design a decision and learning tree in which decision are made about emission reduction at regular intervals: the decision makers (who act as social planners) have to decide whether to implement the environmental or not (keeping then the flexibility to act later). By investing in the environmental policy, they determine optimally the date of the optimal emission reduction. At the same time, they receive new information on the probability of a WAIS collapse and the severity of its impacts. The probability of a WAIS collapse is endogenous and contingent on greenhouse gas concentrations. We solve this optimisation problem by backward induction. We find that a potential WAIS collapse substantially bring the date of the optimal emission reduction forward and increases its amount if the probability is high enough (a probability of 1% per year for the worst case), if the impacts are high enough (a worst case damage of 10% of GDP for a 3\u02daC warming) or if the decision maker is risk averse enough (for example a social damage due to pollution equal to 1% GDP for an atmospheric temperature of 3\u02daC). We also find that, as soon as a WAIS collapse is a foregone fact, emission reduction falls to free up resource to prepare for adapting to the inevitable. By contrast, adaptation (such as building dikes along the coast) postpones policy intervention because that strategy reduces the risk of catastrophic damages.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "cd878069676d6fa5e1dc6b490bbe6ebbeb442523", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2745683315", "DOI": "10.1002/BSE.1978", "CorpusId": 158460322}, "title": "Corporate Carbon and Financial Performance: The Role of Emission Reductions", "abstract": "This article uses econometric techniques to examine the effect of corporate carbon performance on corporate financial performance.

The only enzyme known to reduce N2O is the nitrous oxide reductase, encoded by the nosZ gene, which is present among bacteria and archaea capable of either complete denitrification or only N2O reduction to di-nitrogen gas. To determine whether the occurrence of nosZ, being a proxy for the trait N2O reduction, differed among taxonomic groups, preferred habitats or organisms having either NirK or NirS nitrite reductases encoded by the nirK and nirS genes, respectively, 652 microbial genomes across 18 phyla were compared. Furthermore, the association of different co-occurrence patterns with enzymes reducing nitric oxide to N2O encoded by nor genes was examined. We observed that co-occurrence patterns of denitrification genes were not randomly distributed across taxa, as specific patterns were found to be more dominant or absent than expected within different taxonomic groups. The nosZ gene had a significantly higher frequency of co-occurrence with nirS than with nirK and the presence or absence of a nor gene largely explained this pattern, as nirS almost always co-occurred with nor. This suggests that nirS type denitrifiers are more likely to be capable of complete denitrification and thus contribute less to N2O emissions than nirK type denitrifiers under favorable environmental conditions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis indicated a greater degree of shared evolutionary history between nosZ and nirS. However 30% of the organisms with nosZ did not possess either nir gene, with several of these also lacking nor, suggesting a potentially important role in N2O reduction. Co-occurrence patterns were also non-randomly distributed amongst preferred habitat categories, with several habitats showing significant differences in the frequencies of nirS and nirK type denitrifiers.

While CO2 receives the most attention as a factor relative to global warming, CH4, N2O and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) also cause significant radiative forcing. With the relative global warming potential of 25 compared with CO2, CH4 is one of the most important GHGs. This article reviews the prediction models, estimation methodology and strategies for reducing enteric CH4 emissions. Emission of CH4 in ruminants differs among developed and developing countries, depending on factors like animal species, breed, pH of rumen fluid, ratio of acetate:propionate, methanogen population, composition of diet and amount of concentrate fed. Among the ruminant animals, cattle contribute the most towards the greenhouse effect through methane emission followed by sheep, goats and buffalos, respectively. The estimated CH4 emission rate per cattle, buffaloe, sheep and goat in developed countries are 150.7, 137, 21.9 and 13.7 (g/animal/day) respectively. However, the estimated rates in developing countries are significantly lower at 95.9 and 13.7 (g/animal/day) per cattle and sheep, respectively. There exists a strong interest in developing new and improving the existing CH4 prediction models to identify mitigation strategies for reducing the overall CH4 emissions. A synthesis of the available literature suggests that the mechanistic models are superior to empirical models in accurately predicting the CH4 emission from dairy farms. The latest development in prediction model is the integrated farm system model which is a process-based whole-farm simulation technique. Several techniques are used to quantify enteric CH4 emissions starting from whole animal chambers to sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer techniques. The latest technology developed to estimate CH4 more accurately is the micrometeorological mass difference technique. Because the conditions under which animals are managed vary greatly by country, CH4 emissions reduction strategies must be tailored to country-specific circumstances. Strategies that are cost effective, improve productivity, and have limited potential negative effects on livestock production hold a greater chance of being adopted by producers. It is also important to evaluate CH4 mitigation strategies in terms of the total GHG budget and to consider the economics of various strategies.

Air quality observations by satellite instruments are global and have a regular temporal resolution, which makes them very useful in studying long-term trends in atmospheric species. To monitor air quality trends in China for the period 2005\u20132015, we derive SO2 columns and NOx emissions on a provincial level with improved accuracy. To put these trends into perspective they are compared with public data on energy consumption and the environmental policies of China. We distinguish the effect of air quality regulations from economic growth by comparing them relatively to fossil fuel consumption. Pollutant levels, per unit of fossil fuel, are used to assess the effectiveness of air quality regulations. We note that the desulfurization regulations enforced in 2005\u20132006 only had a significant effect in the years 2008\u20132009, when a much stricter control of the actual use of the installations began. For national NOx emissions a distinct decreasing trend is only visible from 2012 onwards, but the emission peak year differs from province to province. Unlike SO2, emissions of NOx are highly related to traffic. Furthermore, regulations for NOx emissions are partly decided on a provincial level. The last 3\u00a0years show a reduction both in SO2 and NOx emissions per fossil fuel unit, since the authorities have implemented several new environmental regulations. Despite an increasing fossil fuel consumption and a growing transport sector, the effects of air quality policy in China are clearly visible.

This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to \u223c75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959\u20131999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak.

We obtain good agreements between the modelled ozone/nitrogen species and a range of observations including surface ozone measurements, ozone sonde data, and some aircraft campaigns. Four 2100 calculations assess model responses to projected changes of anthropogenic emissions (SRES A2), climate change (due to doubling CO 2 ), and idealised climate change-associated changes in biogenic emissions (i.e. 50% increase of isoprene emission and doubling emissions of soil-NO x ). The global tropospheric ozone burden increases significantly for all the 2100 A2 simulations, with the largest response caused by the increase of anthropogenic emissions. Climate change has diverse impacts on O 3 and its budgets through changes in circulation and meteorological variables. Increased water vapour causes a substantial ozone reduction especially in the tropical lower troposphere (>10 ppbv reduction over the tropical ocean). On the other hand, an enhanced stratosphere-troposphere exchange of ozone, which increases by 80% due to doubling CO 2 , contributes to ozone increases in the extratropical free troposphere which subsequently propagate to the surface. Projected higher temperatures favour ozone chemical production and PAN decomposition which lead to high surface ozone levels in certain regions. Enhanced convection transports ozone precursors more rapidly out of the boundary layer resulting in an increase of ozone production in the free troposphere. Lightning-produced NO x increases by about 22% in the doubled CO 2 climate and contributes to ozone production. The response to the increase of isoprene emissions shows that the change of ozone is largely determined by background NO x levels: high NO x environment increases ozone production; isoprene emitting regions with low NO x levels see local ozone decreases, and increase of ozone levels in the remote region due to the influence of PAN chemistry. The calculated ozone changes in response to a 50% increase of isoprene emissions are in the range of between \u22128 ppbv to 6 ppbv.

This challenge mostly relates to the lack of reduction in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from diesel road vehicles relative to the reductions expected through increasingly stringent vehicle emissions legislation. However, a key component of near-road concentrations of NO2 derives from directly emitted (primary) NO2 from diesel vehicles. It is well-established that the proportion of NO2 (i.e. the NO2/NOx ratio) in vehicle exhaust has increased over the past decade as a result of vehicle after-treatment technologies that oxidise carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and generate NO2 to aid the emissions control of diesel particulate. In this work we bring together an analysis of ambient NOx and NO2 measurements with comprehensive vehicle emission remote sensing data obtained in London to better understand recent trends in the NO2/NOx ratio from road vehicles. We show that there is evidence that NO2 concentrations have decreased since around 2010 despite less evidence of a reduction in total NOx. The decrease is shown to be driven by relatively large reductions in the amount of NO2 directly emitted by vehicles; from around 25 vol% in 2010 to 15 vol% in 2014 in inner London, for example. The analysis of NOx and NO2 vehicle emission remote sensing data shows that these reductions have been mostly driven by reduced NO2/NOx emission ratios from heavy duty vehicles and buses rather than light duty vehicles. However, there is also evidence from the analysis of Euro 4 and 5 diesel passenger cars that as vehicles age the NO2/NOx ratio decreases. For example the NO2/NOx ratio decreased from 29.5 \u00b1 2.0% in Euro 5 diesel cars up to one year old to 22.7 \u00b1 2.5% for four-year old vehicles.

Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city. 3.

Therefore, in order to realize the targets of energy conservation and emission reduction, China should improve the efficiency of energy utilization, optimize energy and industrial structure, choose the low-carbon urbanization approach and implement regional cooperation strategy of energy conservation and emissions reduction.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "adaab55d5c45f90c8f6ebdfb1fa33e045262d134", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120010445", "DOI": "10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309691", "CorpusId": 16837116}, "title": "One million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2015", "abstract": "It is mentioned that one million plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles will be on the road by 2015 in United States to reduce emission. If one million electric vehicles (EVs) are connected to the existing electric grid randomly, peak load will be very high. Electrified transportation based on a traditional thermal power system will be costly economically and environmentally though it has a great value for electric power and transportation sectors. EVs cannot alone solve the emission problem completely since they need electric power, which is one of the main sources of emission. Therefore, significant emission reduction greatly depends on the maximum utilization of renewable energy. Two models are investigated to show the effect of one million EVs on electric power and transportation sectors. Linear and non-linear systems are used in modeling the emissions generated from the transportation and electric energy sectors respectively.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "dc4cbec3d212a1329e63ddb7181ab50f2271200a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2011190583", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1203282109", "CorpusId": 205257889, "PubMed": "22826257"}, "title": "Developed and developing world responsibilities for historical climate change and CO2 mitigation", "abstract": "At the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference in Cancun, in November 2010, the Heads of State reached an agreement on the aim of limiting the global temperature rise to 2\u2009\u00b0C relative to preindustrial levels. They recognized that long-term future warming is primarily constrained by cumulative anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, that deep cuts in global emissions are required, and that action based on equity must be taken to meet this objective. However, negotiations on emission reduction among countries are increasingly fraught with difficulty, partly because of arguments about the responsibility for the ongoing temperature rise. Simulations with two earth-system models (NCAR/CESM and BNU-ESM) demonstrate that developed countries had contributed about 60\u201380%, developing countries about 20\u201340%, to the global temperature rise, upper ocean warming, and sea-ice reduction by 2005. Enacting pledges made at Cancun with continuation to 2100 leads to a reduction in global temperature rise relative to business as usual with a 1/3\u20132/3 (CESM 33\u201367%, BNU-ESM 35\u201365%) contribution from developed and developing countries, respectively. To prevent a temperature rise by 2\u2009\u00b0C or more in 2100, it is necessary to fill the gap with more ambitious mitigation efforts.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "f0e9c9d62b0ab8915a2e697a6052758defdd53a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1517874795", "DOI": "10.4271/980539", "CorpusId": 136786391}, "title": "VERT : DIESEL NANO-PARTICULATE EMISSIONS : PROPERTIES AND REDUCTION STRATEGIES", "abstract": null, "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "41e0da740122ebd512a6017150532ba6785bfbd5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2010869192", "DOI": "10.1021/JP212450D", "CorpusId": 58904266}, "title": "Confirmation of Isolated Cu2+ Ions in SSZ-13 Zeolite as Active Sites in NH3-Selective Catalytic Reduction", "abstract": "NH3-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NH3-SCR) is a widely used technology for NOx reduction in the emission control systems of heavy duty diesel vehicles. Copper-based ion exchanged zeolites and in particular Cu-SSZ-13 (CHA framework) catalysts show both exceptional activity and hydrothermal stability for this reaction. In this work, we have studied the origin of the SCR activity of Cu-SSZ-13 as evidenced from a combination of synchrotron-based and laboratory techniques. Synchrotron-based in situ XAFS/XRD measurements were used to provide complementary information on the local copper environment under realistic NH3-SCR conditions. Crucial then to the catalytic activity of Cu-SSZ-13 is the local environment of the copper species, particularly in the zeolite. Cu-SSZ-13 contains mononuclear Cu2+ species, located in the face of the double-6-ring subunit of the zeolite after calcination where it remains under reaction conditions. At lower temperatures (with low activity), XAFS and XRD data revealed a conformatio...", "year": 2012}]}
