A number of indicators have been proposed to reflect comparability of effort and differences in national circumstances; key amongst these are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (per capita), GDP per capita, as well as GHG mitigation potential. This paper focuses on mitigation potential to provide a comparative assessment between six OECD member economies: Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico and the US. GHG mitigation potential is defined to be the level of GHG emission reductions that could be realised, relative to the projected emission baseline in a given year, for a given carbon price. Data for the selected countries were obtained across the time horizon of 2005-2050 from a total of 19 models, including models that are used to inform climate policy-makers in each of these economies. The paper examines the implications of model structure, and assesses how baseline scenarios vary between the models, before analysing the GHG mitigation potential estimates. GHG mitigation potential is compared for carbon prices of USD 20, 50 and 100/tCO2e. For an assumed carbon price of USD 50/tCO2e, mitigation potential in Japan is estimated to be relatively lower than for the other five economies, ranging from 5-20% emission reduction from baseline in 2020. Although noticeably fewer models report data for Mexico at this price level, the models show deeper potential reductions in the range of 25-37% at the same carbon price. Mitigation potential estimates for Australia, Canada and the US show a wider range of 14-39% reduction relative to 2020 baselines. The EU shows a relatively tighter range of 16-29% emission reductions to 2020. The results of this study show greater emission reduction potentials in the year 2050 than in the year 2020 across the six economies examined, reflecting structural and technical changes that occur over time, including the availability of carbon capture and storage from 2030. In general, the paper finds closer agreement across the models for mitigation potential in 2020 than for later years, reflecting greater uncertainty as projections extend into the future. La question de la comparabilite des objectifs fixes par les differents pays en matiere d\u2019attenuation, et des mesures prises pour les atteindre, reste d\u2019actualite dans les negociations internationales sur le climat. Une serie d\u2019indicateurs ont ete proposes pour evaluer la possibilite de comparer les efforts deployes et les disparites dues aux specificites nationales ; parmi ces indicateurs figurent, au premier chef, les emissions de gaz a effet de serre (GES) par habitant, le PIB par habitant et le potentiel d\u2019attenuation des GES. La presente etude s\u2019interesse principalement a ce dernier facteur et livre une comparaison entre six economies de l\u2019OCDE : Australie, Canada, Etats-Unis, Japon, Mexique et Union europeenne. Par potentiel d\u2019attenuation, on entend le niveau de reduction des emissions de GES qu\u2019il a ete possible d\u2019atteindre, par rapport aux quantites d\u2019emissions prevues dans le scenario de reference pour une annee donnee, et pour un prix donne du carbone. Les donnees relatives aux pays choisis ont ete obtenues pour la periode 2005-2050, a partir de 19 modeles au total, dont certains servent a informer les responsables des politiques climatiques de ces economies. Le document examine les implications de la structure des modeles, ainsi que les variations entre les scenarios de reference des differents modeles, avant d\u2019analyser les estimations du potentiel d\u2019attenuation des GES. La comparaison entre les potentiels d\u2019attenuation des GES se fonde sur des prix du carbone fixes a 20, 50 et 100 USD/t eq. CO2. Pour un prix etabli a 50 USD/t eq. CO2, on estime que ce potentiel est plus faible au Japon que dans les cinq autres economies, ou la reduction des emissions devrait se situer en 2020 entre 5 et 20 % par rapport au scenario de reference. Les modeles fournissant des donnees sur le Mexique -- sensiblement moins nombreux pour ce niveau de prix -- font apparaitre des possibilites de reduction plus importantes, comprises entre 25 et 37 % pour un prix identique du carbone. Les estimations effectuees pour l\u2019Australie, le Canada et les Etats-Unis revelent une fourchette plus large, le potentiel de reduction allant de 14 a 39 % par rapport aux scenarios de reference pour 2020. S\u2019agissant de l\u2019UE, l\u2019eventail est relativement plus resserre, puisque les reductions se situent entre 16 et 29 % a l\u2019horizon 2020. Les conclusions de cette etude font ressortir un potentiel de reduction des emissions plus eleve en 2050 qu\u2019en 2020 pour les six economies considerees, en raison d\u2019evolutions structurelles et techniques intervenant au fil du temps, et notamment gr\u00e2ce a la possibilite de pieger et de stocker le carbone a partir de 2030. De maniere generale, le document montre que les modeles relatifs au potentiel d\u2019attenuation presentent davantage de points communs en 2020 que dans les annees ulterieures, signe que les incertitudes sont plus marquees des lors que les projections portent sur des periodes plus eloignees.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "4defd51dda31ff17e115f4203364e3bf05401a58", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016902352", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2013.04.066", "CorpusId": 109213199}, "title": "Multi-objective optimization for combined heat and power economic dispatch with power transmission loss and emission reduction", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ebcf281ba37234a0ce4ce7debef344ac585d7410", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047372207", "DOI": "10.1063/1.109741", "CorpusId": 97496820}, "title": "Field\u2010emitter array performance enhancement using hydrogen glow discharges", "abstract": "The changes in the current\u2010voltage characteristics and electron emission spatial distribution of microfabricated field emitters following exposure to hydrogen low\u2010pressure glow discharges have been investigated.

In the late 1990s, a limit of 2\u00b0C global warming above preindustrial temperature was proposed as a \u2018guard rail\u2019 below which most of the dangerous climate impacts could be avoided. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord recognized the scientific view \u2018that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius\u2019 despite growing views that this might be too high. At the same time, the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the past decade and the delays in a comprehensive global emissions reduction agreement have made achieving this target extremely difficult, arguably impossible, raising the likelihood of global temperature rises of 3\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C within this century. Yet, there are few studies that assess the potential impacts and consequences of a warming of 4\u00b0C or greater in a systematic manner.

The potential severity of impacts and the behavioural, institutional, societal and economic challenges involved in coping with these impacts argue for renewed efforts to reduce emissions, using all available mechanisms, to minimize the chances of high-end climate change.

Over the last 5 decades monitoring systems have been developed to detect changes in the accumulation of carbon (C) in the atmosphere and ocean; however, our ability to detect changes in the behavior of the global C cycle is still hindered by measurement and estimate errors. Here we present a rigorous and flexible framework for assessing the temporal and spatial components of estimate errors and their impact on uncertainty in net C uptake by the biosphere. We present a novel approach for incorporating temporally correlated random error into the error structure of emission estimates. Based on this approach, we conclude that the 2\u03c3 uncertainties of the atmospheric growth rate have decreased from 1.2 Pg C yr\u22121 in the 1960s to 0.3 Pg C yr\u22121 in the 2000s due to an expansion of the atmospheric observation network. The 2\u03c3 uncertainties in fossil fuel emissions have increased from 0.3 Pg C yr\u22121 in the 1960s to almost 1.0 Pg C yr\u22121 during the 2000s due to differences in national reporting errors and differences in energy inventories. Lastly, while land use emissions have remained fairly constant, their errors still remain high and thus their global C uptake uncertainty is not trivial. Currently, the absolute errors in fossil fuel emissions rival the total emissions from land use, highlighting the extent to which fossil fuels dominate the global C budget. Because errors in the atmospheric growth rate have decreased faster than errors in total emissions have increased, a ~20% reduction in the overall uncertainty of net C global uptake has occurred. Given all the major sources of error in the global C budget that we could identify, we are 93% confident that terrestrial C uptake has increased and 97% confident that ocean C uptake has increased over the last 5 decades. Thus, it is clear that arguably one of the most vital ecosystem services currently provided by the biosphere is the continued removal of approximately half of atmospheric CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, although there are certain environmental costs associated with this service, such as the acidification of ocean waters.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "8b2607046a3ce9211364016a8efb677db2f5179f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087837082", "DOI": "10.1007/s10705-010-9371-7", "CorpusId": 24249201}, "title": "Dynamics of methane emission, active soil organic carbon and their relationships in wetland integrated rice-duck systems in Southern China", "abstract": "A randomized field experiment with three replicates was conducted in the subtropical region of China to investigate the effects of integrated rice-duck system (RD) on methane (CH4) emission, active soil organic carbon fractions and their relationships in 2007 and 2008, compared with conventional rice system (CK). Methane emissions were measured at 7\u20139\u00a0days intervals using a closed static chamber technique, and two fractions of active soil organic carbon, namely, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), were analyzed simultaneously. Soil DOC and MBC in RD and CK had similarly distinct seasonal variation patterns within the 2\u00a0years. During this time DOC and MBC concentrations were low at the early growth stage, increased during panicle differentiation and heading period, and dropped during grain filling period of rice. CH4 emission fluxes from RD and CK followed a similar seasonal variation pattern both in 2007 and 2008. Two peaks of CH4 emission were observed, the first at the tillering stage, second at panicle differentiation and heading stage. The CH4 cumulative emission was reduced in RD by 19.3 and 19.6% in 2007 and 2008, respectively, compared with CK. Seasonal variation pattern of CH4 emission was regulated by soil DOC, MBC and soil temperature, all of which were significantly positively correlated with methane emissions.

Due to this flexibility, flexible CCS generators provide system benefits that normal CCS generators do not, which could make flexible CCS an economic CO2 emission reduction strategy. Here, we estimate the system-level cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions with flexible CCS compared to redispatching (i.e., substituting gas- for coal-fired electricity generation), wind, and normal CCS under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical more stringent CO2 emission reduction target (\"stronger CPP\"). Using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model, we find flexible CCS achieves more cost-effective emission reductions than normal CCS under both reduction targets, indicating that policies that promote CCS should encourage flexible CCS.

Further, ozone in the tropopause acts as a strong greenhouse gas, and increasing ozone trends at these altitudes contribute to climate change. This review contains a short description of the various techniques that provided atmospheric ozone measurements valuable for long\u2010term trend analysis. The anthropogenic emissions of substances that deplete ozone (chlorine\u2010 and bromine\u2010containing volatile gases) have increased from the 1950s until the second half of the 1980s. The most severe consequence of the anthropogenic release of ozone\u2010depleting substances is the \u201cAntarctic ozone hole.\u201d Long\u2010term observations indicate that stratospheric ozone depletion in the southern winter\u2010spring season over Antarctica started in the late 1970s, leading to a strong decrease in October total ozone means. Present values are only approximately half of those observed prior to 1970. In the Arctic, large ozone depletion was observed in winter and spring in some recent years. Satellite and ground\u2010based measurements show no significant trends in the tropics but significant long\u2010term decreasing trends in the northern and southern midlatitudes (of the order of 2\u20134% per decade in the period from 1970 to 1996 and an acceleration in trends in the 1980s).

The possibility of a reduction in the observed trends has been discussed recently, but it is very hard to distinguish this from the natural variability. As a consequence of the Montreal Protocol process, the emissions of ozone\u2010depleting substances have decreased since the late 1980s. Chlorine is no longer increasing in the stratosphere, although the total bromine amount is still increasing.

The global atmospheric iron (Fe) cycle is parameterized in the global 3-D chemical transport model TM4-ECPL to simulate the proton- and the organic ligand-promoted mineral-Fe dissolution as well as the aqueous-phase photochemical reactions between the oxidative states of Fe (III/II). Primary emissions of total (TFe) and dissolved (DFe) Fe associated with dust and combustion processes are also taken into account, with TFe mineral emissions calculated to amount to ~ 35 Tg-Fe yr\u22121 and TFe emissions from combustion sources of ~ 2 Tg-Fe yr\u22121. The model reasonably simulates the available Fe observations, supporting the reliability of the results of this study. Proton- and organic ligand-promoted Fe dissolution in present-day TM4-ECPL simulations is calculated to be ~ 0.175 Tg-Fe yr\u22121, approximately half of the calculated total primary DFe emissions from mineral and combustion sources in the model (~ 0.322 Tg-Fe yr\u22121). The atmospheric burden of DFe is calculated to be ~ 0.024 Tg-Fe. DFe deposition presents strong spatial and temporal variability with an annual flux of ~ 0.496 Tg-Fe yr\u22121, from which about 40 % (~ 0.191 Tg-Fe yr\u22121) is deposited over the ocean. The impact of air quality on Fe deposition is studied by performing sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850), present (year 2008) and future (year 2100) emission scenarios. These simulations indicate that about a 3 times increase in Fe dissolution may have occurred in the past 150 years due to increasing anthropogenic emissions and thus atmospheric acidity. Air-quality regulations of anthropogenic emissions are projected to decrease atmospheric acidity in the near future, reducing to about half the dust-Fe dissolution relative to the present day. The organic ligand contribution to Fe dissolution shows an inverse relationship to the atmospheric acidity, thus its importance has decreased since the preindustrial period but is projected to increase in the future. The calculated changes also show that the atmospheric DFe supply to the globe has more than doubled since the preindustrial period due to 8-fold increases in the primary non-dust emissions and about a 3-fold increase in the dust-Fe dissolution flux. However, in the future the DFe deposition flux is expected to decrease (by about 25 %) due to reductions in the primary non-dust emissions (about 15 %) and in the dust-Fe dissolution flux (about 55 %). The present level of atmospheric deposition of DFe over the global ocean is calculated to be about 3 times higher than for 1850 emissions, and about a 30 % decrease is projected for 2100 emissions. These changes are expected to impact most on the high-nutrient\u2013low-chlorophyll oceanic regions.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "e1662774e6137c67d40ff45f7573ae4e6302b45a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991771159", "DOI": "10.4271/2012-01-0869", "CorpusId": 62900146}, "title": "Review on the effects of dual-fuel operation, using diesel and gaseous fuels, on emissions and performance", "abstract": "In recent years the automotive industry has been forced to reduce the harmful and pollutant emissions emitted by direct injected diesel engines. To accomplish this difficult task various solutions have been proposed. One of these proposed solutions is the usage of gaseous fuels in addition to the use of liquid diesel. These gaseous fuels have more gasoline-like properties, such as high octane numbers, and are thereby are resistant against auto-ignition. Diesel on the other hand, has a high cetane number which makes it prone to auto-ignition. In this case the gaseous fuel is injected in the inlet manifold, and the diesel is direct injected in the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke. Thereby the diesel fuel spontaneously ignites and acts as an ignition source. The main goals for the use of a dual-fuel operation with diesel and gaseous fuels are the reduction of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission. Furthermore, the application of such a dual-fuel operation can offer potential economic and efficiency advantages. Depending on the gaseous fuel used these goals can be achieved. In general, dual-fuel combustion of gaseous fuels and diesel decreases soot emissions compared with normal diesel combustion except for syngas. Furthermore, increasing load and/or gaseous fuel content leads to a further decrease in soot emissions. Both the application natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as gaseous fuel offer the possibility to diminish nitrogen oxide emissions probably due to homogenous mixture compositions and/or decreased mixture temperatures. However, the using hydrogen or syngas in dual-fuel combustion tends to increase nitrogen oxide emissions; this might be due to the higher flame temperatures and combustion rates of these gasses. Furthermore, the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxides tend to increase for all evaluated gaseous fuels with dual fuel combustion mainly due to incomplete combustion of mixture trapped in crevices. Efficiencies of the different gaseous fuels are in the same order of magnitude. Some seem to lead to slight efficiency improvements (hydrogen and LPG) while others result in a slight decrease (natural gas and syngas). However, the significant price difference of natural gas and LPG compared to diesel can offer a considerable economic advantage.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "24bfacaa1eb5c7d9a94a0cc4e02d74a5e05fc7fa", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5324101", "MAG": "2590598503", "DOI": "10.1038/srep43329", "CorpusId": 6939068, "PubMed": "28233839"}, "title": "Rainfall reduction amplifies the stimulatory effect of nitrogen addition on N2O emissions from a temperate forest soil", "abstract": "Soil is a significant source of atmospheric N2O, and soil N2O emissions at a global scale are greatly affected by environment changes that include continuous deposition of atmospheric nitrogen and changing precipitation distribution.

A review", "abstract": "Sustainability in agriculture means the inclusion of several aspects, as sustainable agriculture systems must not compromise not only their ability to satisfy future needs by undermining soil fertility and the natural resource base but also sustainable agriculture has had to address a range of other issues including energy use, efficient use, and recycling of nutrients, the effects on adjacent ecosystems including the effects on water bodies and climate change. Organic manures are an important factor to keep the soil fertility level of soils. However, their management is often related to large emissions. In this context, anaerobic digestion is\u2014similarly to composting\u2014a treatment option for stabilization of biogenic wastes leading to a residual product called digestates, enabling the sanitation and the recycling and use as fertilizer. It is also a means to obtain energy from wastes as well as from dedicated energy crops. Therefore, anaerobic digestion potentially addresses several aspects of agricultural sustainability. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on the effects of anaerobic digestion on organic compounds in digestates and the most important processes influencing N emissions in the field, as well as the possible long-term effects on soil microbial biomass and soil fertility. The main findings are that (1) the direct effects of anaerobic digestion on long-term sustainability in terms of soil fertility and environmental impact at the field level are of minor relevance. (2) The most relevant effects of anaerobic digestion on soil fertility as well as on N emissions will be expected from indirect effects related to cropping system changes such as changes in crop rotation, crop acreage, cover cropping, and total amounts of organic manures including digestates. Furthermore, (3) the remaining organic fraction after anaerobic digestion is much more recalcitrant than the input feedstocks leading to a stabilization of the organic matter and a lower organic matter degradation rate after field application, enabling a similar reproduction of the soil organic matter as obtained by direct application of the feedstock or by composting of the feedstock. (4) Regarding emissions, the main direct effect of anaerobic digestion on a farm level is the influence on gaseous emissions during manure or digestate treatment and handling, whereas the direct effects of anaerobic digestion on a field level on emissions (NH3\u2212 and N2O\u2212 emissions, NO3- leaching) are negligible or at least ambiguous. (5) The main direct effects of anaerobic digestion on the field level are short-term effects on soil microbial activity and changes in the soil microbial community. Therefore, in terms of the effects on agricultural sustainability, potential cropping system-based changes induced by introduction of biogas plants are probably much more relevant for the overall performance and sustainability of the cropping system than the direct effects triggered by application of digestates in comparison to the undigested feedstocks. Furthermore, to get the full potential advances from implementation of biogas plants in terms of improvement of the nutrient use efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, there is the need to introduce more sophisticated techniques to avoid counteracting effects by pollution swapping, e.g., by gas-tight closure of the digestate stores and direct soil incorporation of the field-applied digestates.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f3ae9eb0cea670af073d757a8851ea11ffa5d379", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2097272425", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1510856112", "CorpusId": 20376109, "PubMed": "26460052"}, "title": "Global alteration of ocean ecosystem functioning due to increasing human CO2 emissions", "abstract": "Significance People are not only concerned about climate change and its effects on plant and animal diversity but also about how humans are fundamentally changing the globe\u2019s largest ecosystem that sustains economic revenue and food for many countries. We show that many species communities and ocean habitats will change from their current states. Ocean acidification and warming increase the potential for an overall simplification of ecosystem structure and function with reduced energy flow among trophic levels and little scope for species to acclimate. The future simplification of our oceans has profound consequences for our current way of life, particularly for coastal populations and those that rely on oceans for food and trade. Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anticipated to drive change to ocean ecosystems, but a conceptualization of biological change derived from quantitative analyses is lacking. Derived from multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632 published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this response does not translate into greater secondary production, which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth\u2019s heat budget. Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for microbes.

Such reaction has been shown to reduce appreciably the emissions of NO from fluidized bed coal combustors (Pereira et al., 1975). A number of experimental studies were carried out of the NO/char reactions using fixed and fluidized bed reactors (Furusawa et al., 1977; Chan, 1977; Sprouse, 1977; Beer et al., 1977) in which the products of the reaction were identified and kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined.

One rationale is the belief that biofuels are inherently carbon neutral, meaning that only production-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be tallied when comparing them to fossil fuels. This assumption is embedded in the lifecycle analysis (LCA) modeling used to justify and administer such policies. LCA studies have often found that crop-based biofuels such as corn ethanol and biodiesel offer at least modest net GHG reductions relative to petroleum fuels. Data over the period of RFS expansion enable empirical assessment of net CO2 emission effects. This analysis evaluates the direct carbon exchanges (both emissions and uptake) between the atmosphere and the U.S. vehicle-fuel system (motor vehicles and the physical supply chain for motor fuels) over 2005\u20132013. While U.S. biofuel use rose from 0.37 to 1.34\u00a0EJ/yr over this period, additional carbon uptake on cropland was enough to offset only 37\u00a0% of the biofuel-related biogenic CO2 emissions. This result falsifies the assumption of a full offset made by LCA and other GHG accounting methods that assume biofuel carbon neutrality. Once estimates from the literature for process emissions and displacement effects including land-use change are considered, the conclusion is that U.S. biofuel use to date is associated with a net increase rather than a net decrease in CO2 emissions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "5de19d9d3be5a331ba3b2f883065506d55b5ab82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2606329443", "DOI": "10.1002/cssc.201700427", "CorpusId": 39700731, "PubMed": "28406578"}, "title": "Production of Biomass-Based Automotive Lubricants by Reductive Etherification.", "abstract": "Growing concern with the effects of CO2 emissions due to the combustion of petroleum-based transportation fuels has motivated the search for means to increase engine efficiency.

Most farm machines are driven by fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and, in turn, accelerate climate change. Such environmental damage can be mitigated by the promotion of renewable resources such as solar, wind, biomass, tidal, geo-thermal, small-scale hydro, biofuels and wave-generated power. These renewable resources have a huge potential for the agriculture industry. The farmers should be encouraged by subsidies to use renewable energy technology. The concept of sustainable agriculture lies on a delicate balance of maximizing crop productivity and maintaining economic stability, while minimizing the utilization of finite natural resources and detrimental environmental impacts. Sustainable agriculture also depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use of non-renewable resources, such as natural gas, which is used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer, and mineral ores, e.g. phosphate or fossil fuel used in diesel generators for water pumping for irrigation. Hence, there is a need for promoting use of renewable energy systems for sustainable agriculture, e.g. solar photovoltaic water pumps and electricity, greenhouse technologies, solar dryers for post-harvest processing, and solar hot water heaters. In remote agricultural lands, the underground submersible solar photovoltaic water pump is economically viable and also an environmentally-friendly option as compared with a diesel generator set. If there are adverse climatic conditions for the growth of particular plants in cold climatic zones then there is need for renewable energy technology such as greenhouses for maintaining the optimum plant ambient temperature conditions for the growth of plants and vegetables. The economics of using greenhouses for plants and vegetables, and solar photovoltaic water pumps for sustainable agriculture and the environment are presented in this article. Clean development provides industrialized countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at the lowest cost. The mechanism of clean development is discussed in brief for the use of renewable systems for sustainable agricultural development specific to solar photovoltaic water pumps in India and the world.

EDGAR data provide quantitative support for atmospheric modelling and for mitigation scenario and impact assessment analyses as well as for policy evaluation. The new version (v4.3.2) of the EDGAR emission inventory provides global estimates, broken down to IPCC-relevant source-sector levels, from 1970 (the year of the European Union\u2019s first Air Quality Directive) to 2012 (the end year of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, KP). Strengths of EDGAR v4.3.2 include global geo-coverage (226 countries), continuity in time, and comprehensiveness in activities. Emissions of multiple chemical compounds, GHGs as well as air pollutants, from relevant sources (fossil fuel activities but also, for example, fermentation processes in agricultural activities) are compiled following a bottom-up (BU), transparent and IPCC-compliant methodology. This paper describes EDGAR v4.3.2 developments with respect to three major long-lived GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) derived from a wide range of human activities apart from the land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and apart from savannah burning; a companion paper quantifies and discusses emissions of air pollutants.

We provide uncertainty factors in emissions data for the different GHGs and for three different groups of countries: OECD countries of 1990, countries with economies in transition in 1990, and the remaining countries in development (the UNFCCC nonAnnex I parties).

At the time the UNFCCC was established, the 24 members of the OECD in 1990 and 16 other European countries and Russia were considered liable for \u201cthe largest share of historical and current global emissions of GHG\u201d and taken up in Annex I to the UNFCCC. These Annex I countries and the European Union1 submit annually complete inventories of GHG emissions from the 1990 base year2 until the latest year for which full accounting is completed and reviewed (typically with a 2-year time lag), and these inventories are all reviewed to ensure transparency, completeness, comparability, consistency and accuracy3. This allows for most of these Annex I countries to track progress towards their reduction targets committed under the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997). Other (non-Annex I) countries are encouraged to submit their GHG inventories as part of their National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). The GHG inventories of nonAnnex I countries were required to cover CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions for 1 year (1990 or 1994), without specific documentation and only subject to a brief review. However, the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015) requires submission every 2 years of BURs4, which are subject to international consultation and analysis. Theoretically, UNFCCC should receive at the latest after 2 years national emissions inventories from each of the 197 countries, but as shown in Fig. 1a, not all countries did provide a national inventory and 154 countries did not provide a completed (i.e. year-2) time se1This includes the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) as of 1 July 2013. 2For some economies in transition, another year such as 1988 or 1989 can be chosen under UNFCCC as the base year. These GHG emissions are mainly sources, but also include carbon stock sinks for which the human-induced part needs to be assessed with care (Grassi et al., 2018). 3These five principles of a good reporting practice are defined in the UNFCCC guidelines for national GHG inventory, e.g. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c30/ a1bd769dee5299746e0af825c7ab4ed55fba.pdf. EDGAR uses the term \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d to summarise these principles. 4The first BUR submitted should cover the inventory for the year no more than 4 years prior to the submission data, and subsequent BURs should be submitted every 2 years, but flexibility is given to the least developed countries and small island developing states. ries of inventories. In addition, many countries lack a welldeveloped statistical infrastructure, which is needed for an accurate bottom-up (BU) inventory. Figure 1b presents the latest year that is covered with a national inventory, with dates for quite a few countries more than 10 years ago: for most South-East Asian countries this is between 2004 and 2007 and for most African countries between 2000 and 2003. As such, the collection of national reports/communications does not provide a complete, consistent and comparable global dataset which can be used to understand the global budgets of the most important GHG emissions and their impact on climate. Very few bottom-up inventories of global anthropogenic emissions have been produced with continued effort for more than 2 decades. The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC) (Boden et al., 2017; Andres et al., 2014) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) (Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2016; Olivier et al., 2016) provide global totals, whereas the IEA provides CO2 estimates from fuel combustion only and the FAO CH4 from agriculture only. While CDIAC ceased operation in September 2017, the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) (Oda et al., 2018) continued to use the CDIAC data and combined these with geospatial proxies (including night light satellite maps) to provide CO2 grid maps, as EDGAR is also doing (using other geospatial proxies). In addition, the new Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) of Hoesly et al. (2018) builds upon existing inventories to provide a new gridded dataset of all emission species for the Climate Model Inter-comparison Programme CMIP6. The scientific community started to bring together these anthropogenic BU emissions with top-down estimates covering also the natural component to obtain the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2018) and the Global Methane Budget (Saunois et al., 2016). These budgets are important input for the periodic global stocktake that the Paris Agreement envisages from 2023 onwards (with the submitted inventories for 2021). Even though significant progress in inventory compilation has been made, the overall uncertainty of the global total has become larger over time because the share of emissions from non-Annex I countries (with less developed statistical infrastructure) increased from less than 40 % in 1990 to more than 60 % in 2012, as shown in Fig. 2.

Furthermore, the monthly resolution and global grid maps at a spatial resolution of 0.1\u00d7 0.1 allow direct use in atmospheric models as well as in analyses of policy impacts. The first version of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v2) answered the needs of the air quality community to map technological parameters of air pollution sources and was published by Olivier et al. (1996). Since then, several updated versions (Olivier, 2002) have been released (EDGAR-HYDE, EDGAR v3.2, EDGAR 3.2 FT2000). Driven by the development of scientific knowledge on emission generating processes and by the availability of more recent information, the EDGAR v4 datasets were constructed including new emission factors and additional end-of-pipe abatement measures.

We explore why the persistence of warming depends not just on the decay of a given greenhouse gas concentration but also on climate system behavior, particularly the timescales of heat transfer linked to the ocean. For carbon dioxide and methane, nonlinear optical absorption effects also play a smaller but significant role in prolonging the warming. In effect, dampening factors that slow temperature increase during periods of increasing concentration also slow the loss of energy from the Earth\u2019s climate system if radiative forcing is reduced.

A life-cycle inventory for each mode is necessary to appropriately address and attribute the transportation sector\u2019s energy and emissions impacts to reduction goals instead of allowing tailpipe emissions to act as indicators of total system performance. The contributions of U.S. passenger transportation modes to national energy and emissions inventories account for roughly 20% of U.S. totals, mostly attributed to gasoline consumption. Furthermore, world consumption of primary energy amounted to 490 EJ in 2005 with the U.S. responsible for 110 EJ, or 21% of the total. This means that passenger transportation in the U.S. accounts for roughly 5% of global primary energy consumption annually. With a predominant fossil fuel energy base, the impacts of U.S. passenger transportation have strong implications for global energy consumption, U.S. energy security, and climate change. Furthermore, criteria air pollutant emissions from transportation (passenger and freight) are also significant, accounting for 78% of national CO, 58% of NOX, 36% of VOCs, 9% of PM2.5, 2.6% of PM10, and 4.5% of SO2 emissions. These emissions often occur near population centers and can cause adverse direct human health effects as well as other impacts such as ground-level ozone formation and acid deposition. To appropriately mitigate environmental impacts from transportation, it is necessary for decision makers to consider the life-cycle energy consumption and emissions associated with each mode. A life-cycle energy, greenhouse gas, and criteria air pollutant emissions inventory is created for the passenger transportation modes of automobiles, urban buses, heavy rail transit, light rail transit, and aircraft in the U.S. Each mode\u2019s inventory includes an assessment of vehicles, infrastructure, and fuel components. For each component, analysis is performed for material extraction through use and maintenance in both direct and indirect (supply chain) processes. For each mode\u2019s life-cycle components, energy inputs and emission outputs are determined. Energy inputs include electricity and petroleum-based fuels. Emission outputs include greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) and criteria pollutants (CO, SO2, NOX, VOCs, and PM). The inputs and outputs are normalized by vehicle lifetime, vehicle mile traveled, and passenger mile traveled. A consistent system boundary is applied to all modal inventories which captures the entire life-cycle, except for end-of-life. For each modal life-cycle component, both direct and indirect processes are included if possible. A hybrid life-cycle assessment approach is used to estimate the components in the inventories. We find that life-cycle energy inputs and emission outputs increase significantly compared to the vehicle operational phase. Life-cycle energy consumption is 39-56% larger than vehicle operation for autos, 38% for buses, 93-160% for rail, and 19-24% for air systems per passenger mile traveled. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are 47-65% larger than vehicle operation for autos, 43% for buses, 39-150% for rail, and 24-31% for air systems per passenger mile traveled. The energy and greenhouse gas increases are primarily due to vehicle manufacturing and maintenance, infrastructure construction, and fuel production. For criteria air pollutants, life-cycle components often dominate total emissions and can be a magnitude larger than operational counterparts. Per passenger mile traveled, total SO2 emissions (between 350 and 460 mg) are 19-27 times larger than operational emissions as a result of electricity generation in vehicle manufacturing, infrastructure construction, and fuel production. NOX emissions increase 50-73% for automobiles, 24% for buses, 13-1300% for rail, and 19-24% for aircraft. Non-tailpipe VOCs are 27-40% of total automobile, 71-95% of rail, and 51-81% of air total emissions. Infrastructure and parking construction are major components of total PM10 emissions resulting in total emissions over three times larger than operational emissions for autos and even larger for many rail systems and aircraft (the major contributor being emissions from hot-mix asphalt plants and concrete production). Infrastructure construction and operation as well as vehicle manufacturing increase total CO emissions by 5-17 times from tailpipe performance for rail and 3-9 times for air. A case study comparing the environmental performance of metropolitan regions is presented as an application of the inventory results. The San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, and New York City are evaluated capturing passenger transportation life-cycle energy inputs and greenhouse gas and criteria air pollutant emissions. The regions are compared between off-peak and peak travel as well as personal and public transit. Additionally, healthcare externalities are computed from vehicle emissions. It is estimated that life-cycle energy varies from 6.3 MJ/PMT in the Bay Area to 5.7 MJ/PMT in Chicago and 5.3 MJ/PMT in New York for an average trip. Life-cycle GHG emissions range from 480 g C02e/PMT in the Bay Area to 440 g C02e/PMT for Chicago and 410 g C02e/PMT in New York. CAP emissions vary depending on the pollutant with differences as large as 25% between regions. Life-cycle CAP emissions are between 11% and 380% larger than their operational counterparts. Peak travel, with typical higher riderships, does not necessarily environmentally outperform off-peak travel due to the large share of auto PMT and less than ideal operating conditions during congestion. The social costs of travel range from 51 cent (in 2007 cents) per auto passenger per trip during peak in New York to 6 cents per public transit passenger per trip during peak hours in the Bay Area and New York. Average personal transit costs are around 30 cents while public transit ranges from 28 cents to 41 cents. This dissertation was completed with Professor Arpad Horvath serving as the advisor.

With effective control measures deployed in developed countries, the predominant emission contributor has shifted from developed countries in the early 1960s (61%) to developing countries at present (83%).

This research used modeling to evaluate the mechanisms of N2O formation and reduction in denitrifying biofilms. The kinetic model included formation and consumption of key denitrification species, including nitrate ( NO3\u2212 ), nitrite ( NO2\u2212 ), nitric oxide (NO), and N2O. The model showed that, in presence of excess of electron donor, denitrifying biofilms have two distinct layers of activity: an outer layer where there is net production of N2O and an inner layer where there is net consumption. The presence of oxygen (O2) had an important effect on N2O emission from suspended growth systems, but a smaller effect on biofilm systems. The effects of NO3\u2212 and O2 differed significantly based on the biofilm thickness. Overall, the effects of biofilm thickness and bulk substrate concentrations on N2O emissions are complex and not always intuitive.

We use a dynamic, spatial, multi-market equilibrium model, Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM), to endogenously determine the effects of these policies on cropland allocation, food and fuel prices, and the mix of first and second-generation biofuels. We find that the increase in crop prices under the RFS is likely to be less than 20% in most cases and this increase is much smaller when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy since these policies induce a switch away from corn ethanol to cellulosic biofuels. The impact of the RFS on GHG emissions reduction in the U.S. is fairly modest in size but increases when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy. However, domestic savings in GHG emissions achieved by the RFS can be severely eroded by the indirect land use changes and the rebound effect on global gasoline consumption.

E. Cravens (1997, Geophys. Res. Lett. 24, 105\u2013108). Very small attogram particles were detected in Comet Halley by N. G. Utterback and J. Kissel (1990, Astron. J. 100, 1315\u20131322) using the PUMA and PIA dust analyzers from the Vega and Giotto spacecraft. Of all these processes, only scattering by very small particles and charge transfer of the solar-wind heavy ions are capable of producing the measured soft X-ray emission. In the case of very small particles, the mean particle mass of 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u221219 g suggested by Utterback and Kissel implies that the total production of these particles, which exceeds that of gas by a factor 3.6 (in mass), is inconsistent with the polarization and color of Comet Halley. Both polarization and color require a reduction of the mean mass to (1\u20132) \u00d7 10 \u221219 g. This reduction strongly affects the visible brightness of the particles, which is proportional to m 2 , with a relatively weak effect on the soft X-ray emission.

We use an IPCC climate model to (1) estimate absolute CRF from U.S. corn ethanol and (2) quantify an emissions timing factor (ETF), which is masked in the traditional GHG accounting. In contrast to earlier analyses, ETF is only 2% (5%) over 100 (50) years of impacts.

By affecting the production, oxidation and transport of methane to the atmosphere, plants have a major influence upon the quantities emitted by wetlands. Different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited. Here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions. To quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants (the chimney effect), we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.ResultsWe found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant (i.e. bare soil). Species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass. Emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.ConclusionsWe conclude that plant species (and functional groups) vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere. However, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane. A shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a65235fb2e782d18be451a60a3d14cffd5225438", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2557439019", "DOI": "10.3390/SU8121244", "CorpusId": 16606754}, "title": "A Stackelberg Game Approach in an Integrated Inventory Model with Carbon-Emission and Setup Cost Reduction", "abstract": "This paper formulates an integrated inventory model that allows Stackelberg game policy for optimizing joint total cost of a vendor and buyer system.

One of the commonly adopted approaches is inverse modelling, where CO2 fluxes (emission: positive flux, sink: negative flux) from the terrestrial ecosystems are estimated by combining atmospheric CO2 measurements with atmospheric transport models. The inverse models assume anthropogenic emissions are known, and thus the uncertainties in the emissions introduce systematic bias in estimation of the terrestrial (residual) fluxes by inverse modelling. Here we show that the CO2 sink increase, estimated by the inverse model, over East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia), by about 0.26\u00a0PgC\u00a0year\u22121 (1 Pg\u00a0=\u00a01012 g) during 2001\u20132010, is likely to be an artifact of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions increasing too quickly in China by 1.41\u00a0PgC\u00a0year\u22121. Independent results from methane (CH4) inversion suggested about 41% lower rate of East Asian CH4 emission increase during 2002\u20132012. We apply a scaling factor of 0.59, based on CH4 inversion, to the rate of anthropogenic CO2 emission increase since the anthropogenic emissions of both CO2 and CH4 increase linearly in the emission inventory. We find no systematic increase in land CO2 uptake over East Asia during 1993\u20132010 or 2000\u20132009 when scaled anthropogenic CO2 emissions are used, and that there is a need of higher emission increase rate for 2010\u20132012 compared to those calculated by the inventory methods. High bias in anthropogenic CO2 emissions leads to stronger land sinks in global land\u2013ocean flux partitioning in our inverse model.

Ferret ventricular muscles were skinned by prolonged application of Triton X\u2010100. Aequorin was allowed to diffuse into the myoplasmic space and the resulting light emission was used to monitor the myoplasmic [Ca2+]. The muscle was then activated with a lightly buffered Ca2+ solution and the changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] and tension in response to length changes were investigated. 2. A sudden reduction in muscle length led to a rapid increase in myoplasmic [Ca2+] to a new level which was maintained as long as muscle length was reduced and which was reversed when the muscle was stretched back to the control length. The rate of increase of [Ca2+] when the muscle length was reduced was greater than the rate of decrease in [Ca2+] when the muscle was stretched. 3. Increasing the concentration of EGTA in the activating solution, so as to increase its Ca2+\u2010buffering capacity, eliminated the changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] in response to a length change but had little effect on developed tension. 4. On stretching the muscle there was a slow component of recovery of tension with a time course broadly similar to the rate of decrease of myoplasmic [Ca2+]. The time course of tension redevelopment and of the accompanying reduction in myoplasmic [Ca2+] both decreased to a similar extent when the [Ca2+] used to activate the muscle was increased. 5. Step reductions of length of increasing amplitude caused increases in myoplasmic [Ca2+] which were larger in proportion to the size of the step. 6. Step reductions of length of equal size but from different starting lengths caused changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+] the amplitude of which correlated with the change in tension rather than the change in length. 7. The increase in myoplasmic [Ca2+] when muscle length is reduced suggests that Ca2+ is released from a site in the muscle, probably troponin C.

Through improved understanding of the structure-performance relationships in 2D-related catalysts which is achievable through the application of modern in situ characterization techniques, practical photo/photothermal/photoelectrochemical technologies for CO and CO2 reduction to high-valuable products such as olefins could be realized in the not-too-distant future.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2113406cf10b8740eff59f3ea23b05407a01b6e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025318990", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2004.02.003", "CorpusId": 153428795}, "title": "An exploration of the technical feasibility of achieving CO2 emission reductions in excess of 60% within the UK housing stock by the year 2050", "abstract": null, "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "88e19f51f6b52ed5fef253db6d88150c1e12afb3", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/isgteurope/KanchevLFL10", "MAG": "1993422331", "DOI": "10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638875", "CorpusId": 29782235}, "title": "Smart monitoring of a microgrid including gas turbines and a dispatched PV-based active generator for energy management and emissions reduction", "abstract": "By taking into account the fluctuations of the renewable energy based power production, this paper describes a 24-hour ahead energy management for a micro grid.

However, the characteristics of NOx and SOx emissions in large-scale boilers with volumetric combustion were not fully clear. In this paper, an Aspen Plus model of volumetric combustion system was built up based on a co-firing boiler. In order to characterize the reductions of NOx and SOx, three biomass substitution ratios were involved, namely, 100% biomass, 45% biomass with 55% coal, and 100% coal. The effects of flue gas recirculation ratio, air preheating temperature, oxygen concentration, and fuel types on pollutants emission in the volumetric combustion system were investigated. According to the results, it was concluded the higher substitution ratio of biomass in a co-firing boiler, the lower emissions of NOx and SOx. Moreover, flue gas internal recirculation is an effective pathway for NOx reduction and an increased recirculation ratio resulted in a significant decreasing of NOx emission; however, the SOx increased slightly. The influences of air preheating temperature and O2 concentration on NOx emission were getting weak with increasing of recirculation ratio. When 10% or even higher of flue gas was recycled, it was observed that almost no NOx formed thermodynamically under all studied conditions. Finally, to reach a low emission level of NOx, less energy would be consumed during biomass combustion than coal combustion process for internal recirculation of flue gas.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ab752e5d3fa9f0f1dfcb0a08258ff77b14734bff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2028150326", "DOI": "10.1021/IE00035A039", "CorpusId": 95985758}, "title": "Influence of the Temperature and Oxygen Concentration on NOx Reduction In The Natural Gas Reburning Process", "abstract": "The reburning process with natural gas is an effective technique which can be applied in existing coal combustors in order to reduce the NO[sub x] emissions.

The strong growth in ride-sourcing travel requires the government and the industry to adopt strategies for reducing environmental impact. Here, we address a key gap in knowledge on the emerging ride-sourcing travel model by designing a roadmap for realizing low-emission ride-sourcing drawing from an analysis of raw big trip data for Beijing. We found that adopting the most effective low-emission strategies requires joint efforts involving governance and management, enterprise operations, and consumer behavior change. With respect to issues of feasibility and effectiveness, the enterprise operation strategy, involving polices that shorten the pick-up time and increase the vehicle occupancy, is the best option, offering approximately 44% CO2 and NOx emission reductions compared with the current situation. Promoting ride-sourcing usage among car users or potential car users could help reduce emissions attributing to less cars being manufactured (26% CO2 and 24% NOx) but with uncertainty. To achieve low-emission ride-sourcing travel, governments, enterprises, and consumers must collaborate closely and define clear roles, responsibilities, and relationships.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "82b5e3c29755ef5e9f80c139495f0127a07dcb03", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147678713", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehp396", "CorpusId": 14063202, "PubMed": "19797329"}, "title": "Abnormal myocardial insulin signalling in type 2 diabetes and left-ventricular dysfunction.", "abstract": "AIMS\nWhole body and myocardial insulin resistance are features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

Comparative studies were carried out in three mouse models. We demonstrate an unrecognized reduction of IRS1 in skeletal muscle of LVD patients and an unexpected increase in cardiac IRS1-PI3K activity in NIDDM and LVD patients. In NIDDM, there was a concomitant reduction in sarcolemmal GLUT4, whereas in patients with LVD sarcolemmal GLUT4 was increased. We confirm activation of IRS1-PI3K and reduction in sarcolemmal GLUT4 in the insulin resistant ob/ob mouse heart where we also demonstrate perturbation of GLUT4 docking and fusion. A direct relationship between PI3K and GLUT4 was demonstrated in mice expressing activated PI3K in the heart and increased GLUT4 at the sarcolemma was confirmed in a mouse model of LVD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data show that the mechanisms of myocardial insulin resistance are different between NIDDM and LVD.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "e98b72ef48e745b0811ceaaef337248ff764d777", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1869817586", "DOI": "10.1039/C5EE01452B", "CorpusId": 3275349}, "title": "How much bulk energy storage is needed to decarbonize electricity", "abstract": "High cost and technical immaturity of bulk (multi-hour) electricity storage (BES) systems are often cited as major hurdles to increasing the penetration of intermittent renewables. We use a simple model to assess the economics of BES under carbon emissions constraints. Size and dispatch of a green-field generation fleet is optimized to meet a variable load at a 15 minute time resolution. Electricity supply options are wind, gas turbine, BES, and a generic dispatchable-zero-carbon (DZC) source as a proxy for fossil fuel plants with carbon capture or nuclear plants. We review the cost of selected BES technologies and parameterize the performance of storage, focusing on the energy- and power-specific capital costs. We examine sensitivity of the electricity cost to storage performance under a range of emissions constraints. Availability of inexpensive BES systems in general and particularly electrochemical technologies has a small impact on the overall cost of decarbonization. Proportional reductions in capital costs of wind and DZC lower decarbonization costs far more. We find no economic justification for seasonal storage. Intermittent renewables can be used to decarbonize the electricity supply with a proportionally small requirement for BES because gas provides much of the intermittency management even when the carbon emissions intensity is cut to less than 30% of today's U.S. average. Substantial BES is required only when emissions are constrained to nearly zero and DZC is not allowed.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "7f0aa81f868c503b3fa8f015a7e4e0d60b8d2c35", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2185051931", "DOI": "10.2138/AM-1998-11-1212", "CorpusId": 67811316}, "title": "Invisible gold: Comparison of Au deposition on pyrite and arsenopyrite", "abstract": "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and open circuit potentials were used to compare the size, chemical state, and distribution of adsorbed and reduced gold from Au 31 chloride solution on pyrite and arsenopyrite. Many small Au 0 particles grow on the arsenopyrite surface, whereas few, much larger, gold particles appear on pyrite. These results mimic the differences in distribution of gold in some coexisting natural pyrites and arsenopyrites. The rate-limiting step in deposition of gold from Au 31 chloride solutions is the reduction of Au 31 to Au 1 , whereas the open-circuit potential for deposition is determined by the reduction of Au 1 to Au 0 . The open-circuit potential of pyrite or arsenopyrite is a corrosion potential. Presence of Au 31 shifts the corrosion potential to a value that depends on the relative rates of the reduction of Au 31 and the oxidation of the mineral. Open-circuit potential measurements indicate that the rate of deposition of gold on pyrite is controlled almost entirely by the rate of reduction of Au 31 . By contrast, the rate of reduction of gold on arsenopyrite is controlled significantly by the rate of oxidation of arsenopyrite.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "9d84065322c65f1447e0ee0c71c54f8dd1cd72aa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048750062", "DOI": "10.1080/10473289.2005.10464609", "CorpusId": 24918677, "PubMed": "15796105"}, "title": "Evaluating Inspection and Maintenance Programs: A Policy-Making Framework", "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a new analysis approach to design and evaluate motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. The new approach, called I/M-Design, uses real-world data to provide two resources not previously available: (1) a transparent framework to quantitatively illustrate the range of emission reductions available from I/M, and (2) a sensitivity analysis tool to evaluate how key variables affect I/M performance. In addition, the approach satisfies a policy-making information need\u2014how to convey, in a logical and straightforward manner, the expected benefits from I/M without relying on modeling tools inaccessible to those outside the air quality field. The material presented in this article illustrates the new approach by estimating hydrocarbon (HC) emission reduction benefits available from enhanced I/M in southern California\u2019s South Coast Air Basin. I/M-Design estimates that enhanced I/M results in a 14\u201328% reduction in light-duty motor vehicle HC exhaust emissions; this estimate compares well to other California I/M program evaluations. Even more importantly, I/M-Design sensitivity analyses illustrate how I/M programs that implement stringent failure thresholds, motivate pre-test repair work, and improve repair effectiveness can provide emission reductions that substantially exceed the performance of existing programs.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "777c641b5f1df51540cddd408a2a724658cc2e94", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992153244", "DOI": "10.1007/s11947-011-0694-4", "CorpusId": 95770863}, "title": "A Colour Ripeness Indicator for Apples", "abstract": "Ripeness and senescence of climacteric fruits are strongly related to the emission of ethylene gas. The ethylene emission of apples can be detected by a new developed ripeness indicator. This indicator is based on the reduction effect of ethylene causing colour changes in selected metal ions. The used molybdenum (Mo) chromophores change under the impact of ethylene in a colour spectrum from white/light yellow to blue because of a partial reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(V). The sensitivity of molybdenum colour change reactions can be varied by composition and pH values (pH 1.4\u2013pH 1.5) of used ammonium molybdate solution and thus adopted to different fruits and storage conditions. The indicator can be combined with a colour recognition sensor for quantitative measurements of colour change in the frame of the L*a*b* model. The b*-coordinate, reflecting changes from yellow to blue, and the luminance L* continuously vary with increasing ethylene emission. Results obtained with the indicator system were compared with direct determination of ethylene concentrations by gas chromatography (GC-FID). Furthermore, a descriptive sensory test was used to estimate the degree of ripeness.
