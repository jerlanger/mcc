Results show that the total GHG emissions of industrial process has increased, from 1.48 Mt in 2004 to 4.06 Mt in 2009, except for a little decrease in 2008. The cement industry, and iron and steel industries, are the main emission sources, accounting for more than 90% of the total carbon emissions. GHG emissions in 2020 are estimated based on scenario analysis. The research indicates that the cement industry, and iron and steel industries, will still be the largest emission sources, and the total carbon emissions under the business as usual (BAU) scenario will be doubled in 2020 compared with that of 2009. However, when countermeasures are taken, the GHG emission will reduce significantly. Using more clinker substitutes for blended cement, and increasing direct reduction iron process and recycled steel scraps are efficient measures in reducing GHG emission. Scenario 4, which has the highest ratio of 30/70 blended cement and the highest ratio of steel with recycled steel-EAF process, is the best one. In this scenario, the industrial process GHG emission in 2020 can almost stay the same as that of 2009. From the perspective of regions, cement industry and iron and steel industry accounted for the vast majority of GHG emission in all industries. Meanwhile, these two industries become the most potential industries for reduction of GHG emission.

Serial 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed on cynomolgus macaques during infection and chemotherapy with individual agents or the four-drug combination therapy most widely used globally. The size and metabolic activity of lung granulomas varied among animals and even within a single animal during development of disease. Individual granulomas within untreated animals had highly local and independent outcomes, some progressing in size and FDG uptake, while others waned, illustrating the highly dynamic nature of active TB. At necropsy, even untreated animals were found to have a proportion of sterile lesions consistent with the dynamics of this infection. A more marked reduction in overall metabolic activity in the lungs (decreased FDG uptake) was associated with effective treatment. A reduction in the size of individual lesions correlated with a lower bacterial burden at necropsy. Isoniazid treatment was associated with a transient increase in metabolic activity in individual lesions, whereas a net reduction occurred in most lesions from rifampin-treated animals. Quadruple-drug therapy resulted in the highest decrease in FDG uptake.

As global populations increasingly reside in cities, the role of urban emissions in determining the future trajectory of carbon emissions is magnified. Consequently, a number of research efforts have been started in the United States and beyond, focusing on observing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and relating its variations to carbon emissions in cities. Because carbon emissions are intimately tied to socioeconomic activity through the combustion of fossil fuels, and many cities are actively adopting emission reduction plans, such urban carbon research efforts give rise to opportunities for stakeholder engagement and guidance on other environmental issues, such as air quality.This paper describes a research effort centered in the Salt Lake City, Utah, metropolitan region, which is the locus for one of the longest-running urban CO2 networks in the world. The Salt Lake City area provides a rich environment for studying anthropogenic emissions and for understanding the relationship between emissions and socioeconomic activity when the CO2 observations are enhanced with a) air quality observations, b) novel mobile observations from platforms on light-rail public transit trains and a news helicopter, c) dense meteorological observations, and d) modeling efforts that include atmospheric simulations and high-resolution emission inventories.Carbon dioxide and other atmospheric observations are presented, along with associated modeling work.

Major factors in these scenarios analyzes are increased drought tendencies and more extreme weather events, both of which are detrimental to agriculture. Increasing competition for water between agriculture and non-agricultural users also focuses attention on water management issues. Agriculture also has impact on the greenhouse gas balance. Forests and soils are natural sinks for CO2. Removal of forests and changes in land use, associated with the conversion from rural to urban domains, alters these natural sinks. Agricultural livestock and rice cultivation are leading contributors to methane emission into the atmosphere.

In addition, this paper empirically examines the factors that influence the optimal economic growth and carbon emissions. The results indicate that not all provinces will suffer from a loss in gross domestic product (GDP) when confronted by the constraints of carbon emissions reductions. Certain provinces can achieve a win-win situation between economic growth and carbon emissions reductions if they are allowed to reallocate production decisions over time.

Box model runs are carried out to study the sensitivity of the transition value of NOy, which separates the low-NOx. and the high-NOx regimes, to changes in emissions and in ambient conditions. It is shown that the transition value of NOy depends on the hydrocarbon and NOx emissions, on water vapor, on radiation, and on temperature. Increasing hydrocarbon emissions, increasing water vapor, increasing radiation, or increasing temperature shifts the transition value to higher levels. One-dimensional simulations, which include vertical mixing and dry deposition, show that increasing dry deposition reduces the transition value of NOy. Sensitivity studies with a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic model system are carried out to investigate the effects of transport. A smoothing procedure is applied to reduce the large scatter of the O3-NOy relation which is found in these cases. After smoothing, a transition value can be identified. For the southwestern part of Germany it is shown that this transition value indicates areas where NOx reduction leads to the most effective ozone reduction. Runs with various scenarios show the dependence of the transition value on emissions and ambient conditions. A normalization procedure is introduced. The normalization procedure is applied to the model results and to observations. Under high-NOx conditions a large difference between the cases with and without advection is found.

Here, we hypothesize that considering preindustrial LUC affects the attribution because the geographic pattern of preindustrial LUC emissions differs significantly from that of industrial-era emissions and because preindustrial emissions have legacy effects on today?s atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures. We test this hypothesis by estimating CO2 and temperature increases based on carbon cycle simulations of the last millennium. We find that accounting for preindustrial LUC emissions results in a shift of attribution of global temperature increase from the industrialized countries to less industrialized countries, in particular South Asia and China, by up to 2?3%, a level that may be relevant for political discussions.

The search space was designed to be within the experimental capabilities of the engine and control system. The engine testing was done at 1550 r/min, and 25 per cent load. The optimum results showed significant improvements for the NOx and soot emissions. Through analysis of the combustion characteristics, the mechanisms of emission reduction were revealed. The optimum featured a long ignition delay due to retarded SOI timing, and low combustion temperatures as a result of high EGR rates. The resulting long time for mixing and low temperatures helps suppress soot formation. To explore further the effect of mixing on emissions in the low-temperature combustion regime, factors that enhance turbulent mixing rates, including the use of high injection pressures and post injections were examined.

Using soil columns that make it possible to determine emissions and gas phase distribution of soil fumigants, we studied MeI behavior in two soils differing in organic matter content. Additionally, the effectiveness of surface irrigation and tarping with virtually impermeable film (VIF) was assessed. In the lower organic matter, bare soil (control), emissions of MeI were rapid and high (83% of total). Although the peak emission flux was reduced by irrigation, the total loss was very similar to the control (82%). Tarping with VIF dramatically reduced emissions (0.04% total emissions). In the higher organic matter soil, degradation rate of MeI was increased around 4-fold, leading to a significant reduction in emissions (63% total emissions). The work suggests that surface tarping with VIF would be highly effective as an emissions reduction strategy and would also result in the maintenance of high soil gas concentrations (important for pest control). Ripping of the tarp after two weeks led to an immediate spike release of MeI, but, even so, the flux rate at this time was almost 20 times lower than the peak flux rate in the control.

It is essential that decision-makers select an appropriate quantification methodology and have an appreciation of methodological strengths and shortcomings. This work compares four different waste emissions quantification methods, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1996 guidelines, IPCC 2006 guidelines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM), and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities- Partners for Climate Protection (FCM-PCP) quantification tool. Waste disposal data for the greater Toronto area (GTA) in 2005 are used for all methodologies; treatment options (including landfill, incineration, compost, and anaerobic digestion) are examined where available in methodologies. Landfill was shown to be the greatest source of GHG emissions, contributing more than three-quarters of total emissions associated with waste management. Results from the different landfill gas (LFG) quantification approaches ranged from an emissions source of 557 kt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (FCM-PCP) to a carbon sink of\u2009\u221253 kt CO2e (EPA WARM). Similar values were obtained between IPCC approaches. The IPCC 2006 method was found to be more appropriate for inventorying applications because it uses a waste-in-place (WIP) approach, rather than a methane commitment (MC) approach, despite perceived onerous data requirements for WIP. MC approaches were found to be useful from a planning standpoint; however, uncertainty associated with their projections of future parameter values limits their applicability for GHG inventorying. MC and WIP methods provided similar results in this case study; however, this is case specific because of similarity in assumptions of present and future landfill parameters and quantities of annual waste deposited in recent years being relatively consistent. IMPLICATIONS This paper provides insight for municipalities, consultants, and others involved in GHG quantification from waste management with regard to emissions from various treatment options and variation due to methodological selection. By examining the differences in emissions from the quantification tools and guidelines examined in this research, these professionals will gain insight on where shortcomings and methodological differences exist and how these may be addressed.

Although the near-term challenge for most industrialized countries is to achieve their Kyoto targets, the long-term challenge is to meet the objectives of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), i.e., stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, with specific attention being paid to food security, ecological systems, and sustainable economic development. To stabilize the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide requires that emissions eventually be reduced to only a small fraction of current emissions, i.e., 5 to 10% of current emissions.\n\nAll major industrialized countries except the United States, the Russian Federation, and Australia have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The United States and Australia have publicly stated that they will not ratify it, and statements from the Russian Federation are contradictory. Russian ratification is essential for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force.\n\nThe United States has stated that the Kyoto Protocol is flawed policy for four reasons:\n\n\n\n1. There are still considerable scientific uncertainties. However, although it is possible that the projected human-induced changes in climate have been overestimated, it is equally possible that they have been underestimated. Hence, scientific uncertainties, as agreed by the governments under Article 3 of the UNFCCC, are no excuse for inaction (the precautionary principle).\n\n2. High compliance costs would hurt the U.S. economy. This is in contrast to the analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which estimated that the costs of compliance for the United States would be between US$14 and US$135 per ton of carbon avoided with international carbon dioxide emissions trading (a 5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax would be equivalent to US$20 per ton of carbon). These costs could be further reduced by the use of carbon sinks, by carbon trading with developing countries, and by the reduction of other greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n3. It is not fair, because large developing countries such as India and China are not obligated to reduce their emissions. However, fairness is an equity issue. The parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that industrialized countries had an obligation to take the first steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, recognizing that \u223c80% of the total anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have been emitted from industrialized countries (the United States currently emits \u223c25% of global emissions); that per capita emissions in industrialized countries far exceed those from developing countries; that developing countries do not have the financial, technological, or institutional capability of industrialized countries to address the issue; and that increased use of energy is essential for poverty alleviation and long-term economic growth in developing countries.\n\n4. It will not be effective, because developing countries are not obligated to reduce their emissions. It is true that long-term stabilization of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be achieved without global reductions, especially given that most of the projected growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 100 years is from developing countries. Hence, developing countries will have to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases, but industrialized countries should take the lead, as agreed in Kyoto.\n\n\n\nProtection of the climate system will require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; hence, the Kyoto Protocol is recognized to be only the first step on a long journey to protect the climate system. However, unless the United States agrees to meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it is highly unlikely that major developing countries will agree to limit their emissions or that industrialized countries will agree to further reductions beyond those already agreed in Kyoto.\n\nOne very positive development is that about half of the U.S. states have enacted some climate protection measures, and there are a number of initiatives in the U.S. Congress that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act failed to pass in the Senate, 43 senators did vote for it, demonstrating an increasing recognition by members of Congress that there is an urgent need to deal with the climate issue. In addition, more than 40 multinational companies have voluntarily agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and to improve the energy efficiency of their products. Several of these companies have already met or exceeded their initial targets and have saved money in doing so.\n\nTechnologies exist or can be developed to cost-effectively limit the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide to between 450 and 550 parts per million (ppm), but it will take political will, enhanced research and development activities, public-private partnerships, and supporting policies to overcome barriers to the diffusion of these technologies into the marketplace. A number of countries, including the United States, have committed themselves to developing climate-friendly technologies, but the level of investment must be substantially increased. The Kyoto Protocol needs to be ratified, and the United States needs to take meaningful actions to reduce its greenhouse gas concentrations. Governments should then consider setting a long-term target based either on a greenhouse gas stabilization level (between 450 and 550 ppm) or on limits for both the absolute magnitude of global temperature change (less than 2 to 3\u00b0C) and the rate of temperature change (less than 0.2\u00b0C per decade). A series of intermediate targets can then be developed to involve developing countries in an equitable manner. The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions offers a unique opportunity to modernize energy systems and enhance competitiveness in a globalized world.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "eef4f37ea2d71919fb784b20082e08ffb18b4f4e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "118269834", "CorpusId": 107958133}, "title": "Warm-Mix Asphalt: European Practice", "abstract": "Warm-mix asphalt (WMA) is a group of technologies that allow a reduction in the temperatures at which asphalt mixes are produced and placed.

When the emissions were expressed in terms of carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-e), pre-farm emissions comprised ~6% of the life cycle emissions, on-farm activities comprised ~36% and post-farm activities accounted for ~58% of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. We used one 400 g packet of corn chips as the functional unit. The single largest source of greenhouse emissions was the emission of nitrous oxide on the farm as a result of fertiliser application (0.126 kg CO2-e per packet). The next largest was electricity used during the manufacture of the corn chips (0.086 kg CO2-e per packet). The manufacture of the packaging (box plus packet, being 0.06 kg CO2-e) was the next largest source and then the oil for frying the corn chips (0.048 kg CO2-e per packet). Greenhouse gas emissions from fertiliser application were primarily nitrous oxide (N2O), which has a global warming potential of 310 kg CO2-e/kg N2O. In typical irrigated farm systems, these emissions, when converted to CO2-e, are almost three times more than the greenhouse gas emissions that result from energy used to pump water. However, pumping irrigation water from deep bores currently produces greenhouse gas emissions that are almost three times those from irrigation using surface waters. Greenhouse gas emissions from the use of tractors on typical farms are about one-third of the emissions from pumping water. Farm management techniques can be used to increase soil carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If farms that currently burn stubble were to implement stubble incorporation then, in the absence of other changes to the supply chain, they will achieve a 30% reduction in emissions from \u2018cradle to farm-gate\u2019. In absolute terms, when the soil carbon dioxide is included (even though soil carbon dioxide in this instance is not counted as a greenhouse gas in national and international greenhouse gas inventories), our measurements indicate that carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions from farms that produce maize using stubble incorporation are 56% lower than emissions from farms that burn their stubble. The pre-farm and on-farm operations add $0.40 value per kg of CO2-e greenhouse gas emitted. Post-farm processing added $2 value per kg of CO2-e greenhouse gas emitted.

To facilitate our benchmarking of the 83 selected papers, we adopt a literature classification based on the logistic decisions studied within the developed models. We distinguish three categories of logistic decisions: operational management, technology investment and SC design coordination. Companies are currently facing great external pressures from governments and their conscientious customers to reduce their overall emissions. We analyse how these environmental constraints, which we believe are key drivers for low-carbon emissions management, have been incorporated into mathematical models. Analysing these external pressures in terms of concern about carbon emissions constitutes our main contribution through this literature review. In addition, companies are facing a challenge to reduce their carbon emissions, which are mainly generated from production, transport and storage activities. Consequently, the modelling of carbon emissions remains a crucial task when addressing the LCSCM problem. We suggest analysing the techniques used thus far to approximate those carbon emissions. Furthermore, to illustrate our literature classification and the features of the LCSCM problem, we provide the framework on which we based our analysis of the selected literature.

N2O emissions with biochar were similar to the controls without additives over the 2-year experimental period. Biochar application had positive effects on crop growth, along with positive effects on nutrient (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) uptake by crop plants and the availability of soil P, K, Ca and Mg.

The present study quantifies the airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) co-benefits of AB 32 by comparing future air quality under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario (without AB 32) to AB 32 implementation by sector. AB 32 measures were divided into five levels defined by sector as follows: 1) industrial sources, 2) electric utility and natural gas sources, 3) agricultural sources, 4) on-road mobile sources and 5) other mobile sources.

A queuing model for aircraft waiting to depart was developed to test different emissions scenarios and was calibrated using data from the airport in August 2005, a peak travel month. These different scenarios include: (1) redistribution of flights over the course of the day, (2) fleet composition restructuring, and (3) variations in number of departures under current capacity.

For instance, in an extreme case of redistributing departures evenly across flight hours of a day, a 43% emissions reduction from the base case scenario could be achieved.

In 4 of the 15 asymptomatic relatives, caudate and putamen (18)F-dopa uptake was 2.5 SDs lower than the normal mean. These 4 subjects and a fifth asymptomatic relative with normal (18)F-dopa uptake showed a significant reduction of cortical and striatal glucose metabolism in a pattern similar to that of their affected relatives.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n(18)F-dopa and (18)FDG PET allowed us to identify 5 cases with subclinical metabolic dysfunction among 15 subjects (33%) at risk for PSP, suggesting that this approach is useful for characterizing the pattern of aggregation in PSP kindreds.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "d58d15f9538323e12ad0ed9493116ea4bb2b553c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046785808", "DOI": "10.1108/09600031111166410", "CorpusId": 167728432}, "title": "Evaluating CO2 emissions and fatalities tradeoffs in truck transport", "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to model the tradeoffs among fatalities, CO2 emissions and value generated by the truck transportation portion of supply chains with the goal of determining if efforts to reduce CO2 emissions increase transportation\u2010related fatalities.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The joint production of CO2, fatalities, and truck transport value in the 50 US states during 2002\u20102007 is modeled using data envelopment analysis.

These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70% depending on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such nonlinearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sulphur emission-deposition patterns have been identified in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO2 and NH3 in air over the last two decades have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-linearities are now being incorporated in long-range transport models to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future.

Post-1993 the CH4 growth rate has recovered to pre-1991 levels. In this study, we assess the sensitivity of the CH4 growth rate to changes in CH4 emissions from the coal and gas industries over the last 15 years using a global two-dimensional (2-D) model of the atmosphere. Emissions are estimated from available production data, and in the case of natural gas, a spectrum of leakage rates is assumed. Changes in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have been assessed separately from the rest of the world (ROW). Prior to 1989, increased coal and natural gas production led to an increase in the CH4 growth rate (i.e., opposite to that which was observed). During the period 1989 to 1993 the modelled CH4 growth rate decreased by \u223c1\u20132 ppbv yr\u22122 at northern mid-latitudes (assuming constant gas leakage rates), showing that declining emissions, primarily in the form of natural gas from the FSU, may have contributed to the general reduction in the CH4 growth rate from 1989 to 1991. However, this does not explain the large reduction which was observed between 1991 and 1992. A model run with FSU gas leakage rates decreasing by 1% yr\u22121 from 5% in 1990 to 2% in 1993 shows a decrease in the CH4 growth rate of \u223c9\u201312 ppbv yr\u22121 (or \u223c3\u20135 ppbv yr\u22122) over this period.

The field experiment showed that both CO2 and N2O emissions were still effectively reduced by biochar in the third year after application. However, biochar did not influence the biomass yield of sunflower for biogas production (Helianthus annuus L.). Biochar reduced bulk density and increased soil aeration and thus reduced the water\u2010filled pore space (WFPS) in the field, but was also able to suppress N2O emission in the microcosms experiment conducted at constant WFPS.

The largest amplification of natural emissions yields up to 42% higher atmospheric methane concentrations by the year 2100 compared with no change in natural emissions. The most likely scenarios are lower than this, while anthropogenic emission reductions may have a much greater yielding effect, with the potential of halving atmospheric methane concentrations by 2100 compared to when anthropogenic emissions continue to increase as in a business-as-usual case. In a broader perspective, it is shown that man-made emissions can be reduced sufficiently to limit methane-caused climate warming by 2100 even in the case of an uncontrolled natural Arctic methane emission feedback, but this requires a committed, global effort towards maximum feasible reductions.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "f18e8e0db6a4ac1e8b1b278747c73e2d40b8ff19", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2334078489", "DOI": "10.1021/es500783t", "CorpusId": 31078400, "PubMed": "25325168"}, "title": "Behavior of mercury emissions from a commercial coal-fired power plant: the relationship between stack speciation and near-field plume measurements.", "abstract": "The reduction of divalent gaseous mercury (Hg(II)) to elemental gaseous mercury (Hg(0)) in a commercial coal-fired power plant (CFPP) exhaust plume was investigated by simultaneous measurement in-stack and in-plume as part of a collaborative study among the U.S. EPA, EPRI, EERC, and Southern Company. In-stack continuous emission monitoring data were used to establish the CFPP's real-time mercury speciation and plume dilution tracer species (SO2, NOX) emission rates, and an airship was utilized as an airborne sampling platform to maintain static position with respect to the exhaust plume centerline for semicontinuous measurement of target species. Varying levels of Hg(II) concentration (2.39-3.90 \u03bcg m(-3)) and percent abundance (\u223c 87-99%) in flue gas and in-plume reduction were observed. The existence and magnitude of Hg(II) reduction to Hg(0) (0-55%) observed varied with respect to the types and relative amounts of coals combusted, suggesting that exhaust plume reduction occurring downwind of the CFPP is influenced by coal chemical composition and characteristics.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "444f3d6f86e5c9b724019e1d4612d509b8139a9e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071301632", "DOI": "10.1080/00288233.2013.797914", "CorpusId": 85345306}, "title": "Dicyandiamide (DCD) effect on nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate leaching and pasture yield in Canterbury, New Zealand", "abstract": "A 3-year study was carried out in Canterbury, New Zealand, to determine the effect of a nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on N2O emissions, nitrate () leaching and pasture yield. In all 3 years, DCD was highly effective in reducing N2O emissions from urine-nitrogen (N) applied in autumn (April and May), decreasing the N2O emission factor by 41%\u201382%. In addition, DCD consistently reduced -N leaching losses by 48%\u201369% from the animal urine applied in April. Pasture yield responses to DCD application varied from 0%\u201317%, probably due to other growth limiting factors and/or the methodology used in the pasture yield measurement. The reductions in leaching are of particular value at this point in time due to the increasingly strict regional council regulations that are being imposed on farmers to reduce N leaching losses.", "year": 2014}]}
