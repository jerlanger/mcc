The model couples the balancing of C, N and energy fluxes with the target to estimate the climate-relevant CO2, CH4 and N2O sources and sinks of farming systems. For the determination of the net greenhouse effect, calculations of C sequestration in the soil, CO2 emissions from the use of fossil energy, CH4 emissions from livestock keeping and N2O emissions from the soil have been made. The results were converted into CO2 equivalents using its specific global warming potential (GWP). The model has been applied in the experimental farm Scheyern in southern Germany, which had been divided into an organic (org) and a conventional (con) farming system in 1992. Rather detailed series of long-term measuring data are available for the farm in Scheyern, which have been used for validating the software for its efficiency and applicability under very different management yet nearly equal site conditions. The organic farm is multi-structured with a legume-based crop rotation (N2 fixation: 83 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The livestock density (LSU=Livestock Unit according to FAO) is 1.4 LSU ha\u22121. The farm is oriented on closed mass cycles; from the energetic point of view it represents a low-input system (energy input 4.5 GJ ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The conventional farm is a simple-structured cash crop system, based on mineral N (N input 145 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). Regarding the energy consumption, the system is run on high inputs (energy input 14.0 GJ ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The organic crop rotation reaches about 57% (8.3 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the DM yield, about 66% (163 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the N removal and roughly 56% (3741 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the C fixation of the conventional crop rotation. In the organic rotation, 18 GJ per GJ of fossil energy input are bound in the harvested biomass vis-\u00e0-vis 11.1 GJ in the conventional rotation. The strongest influence on the greenhouse effect is exerted by C sequestration and N2O emissions. In Scheyern, C sequestration has set in under organic management (+0.37 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121), while humus depletion has been recorded in the conventional system (\u22120.25 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). Greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) due to fuel consumption and the use of machines are nearly on the same level in both crop rotations. However, the conventional system emits an additional 637 kg CO2 eq ha\u22121 yr\u22121, which had been consumed in the manufacture of mineral N and pesticides in the upstream industry. Besides the analyses in the experimental farm Scheyern, the model has been applied in 28 commercial farms (18 org and 10 con) with comparable soil and climate conditions in the surroundings of Scheyern (mean distance 60 km). The program calculations are aimed at benchmarking the results obtained in the farming systems Scheyern; they are expected to disclose management-specific variations in the emission of climate-relevant gases and to rate the suitability of the model for describing such management-specific effects. In order to make the situation in the farms comparable, only the emissions from cropping systems were analyzed. Livestock keeping remained unconsidered. Due to lower N and energy inputs, clearly lower N2O and CO2 emissions were obtained for the organic farms than for the conventional systems. The analyses have shown possibilities for the optimization of management and the mitigation of GGE. Our findings underline that organic farming includes a high potential for C sequestration and the reduction of GGEs. Currently, the model REPRO is tested by 90 farms in the Federal Republic of Germany with the aim to apply it in the future not only in the field of research but also in the management of commercial farms.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "5c7277f51981eb88112a5a6d5ac35cc19a6e9fcc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2093778721", "DOI": "10.1021/es204645c", "CorpusId": 2417957, "PubMed": "22506835"}, "title": "Switch: a planning tool for power systems with large shares of intermittent renewable energy.", "abstract": "Wind and solar power are highly variable, so it is it unclear how large a role they can play in future power systems.

The aim of this research was to determine the influence of pig slurry, as well as its combination with mineral N, on N2O emissions in the field and their relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil moisture and with rainfall. In spite of varying amounts of organic substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually produced an increase both in N2O emissions due to denitrification and in direct N2O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50% of those due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N2O-N occurred in the first month following fertilizer administration. N2O emissions due to denitrification were highest in the days immediately following the administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N2O emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N2O emission via nitrification differed from N2O losses via denitrification which, under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole growth cycle. The N2O-N losses were highly influenced by physical parameters, particularly rain.

This study demonstrates an evaluation approach that estimates mass emission reductions over time and includes the effect of I/M on vehicle deterioration. It includes a quantitative assessment of benefits from pre-inspection maintenance and repairs and accounts for the selection bias effect that occurs when intermittent high emitters are tested. We report estimates of one-cycle emission benefits of California's Enhanced Smog Check program, ca. 1999. Program benefits equivalent to metric tons per day of prevented emissions were calculated with a \"bottom-up\" approach that combined average per vehicle reductions in mass emission rates (g/gal) with average per vehicle activity, resolved by model year. Accelerated simulation mode test data from the statewide vehicle information database (VID) and from roadside Smog Check testing were used to determine 2-yr emission profiles of vehicles passing through Smog Check and infer emission profiles that would occur without Smog Check. The number of vehicles participating in Smog Check was also determined from the VID. We estimate that in 1999 Smog Check reduced tailpipe emissions of HC, CO, and NO(x) by 97, 1690, and 81 t/d, respectively. These correspond to 26, 34, and 14% of the HC, CO, and NO(x) that would have been emitted by vehicles in the absence of Smog Check. These estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about vehicle deterioration in the absence of Smog Check. Considering the estimated uncertainty in these assumptions yields a range for calculated benefits: 46-128 t/d of HC, 860-2200 t/d of CO, and 60-91 t/d of NO(x). Repair of vehicles that failed an initial, official Smog Check appears to be the most important mechanism of emission reductions, but pre-inspection maintenance and repair also contributed substantially. Benefits from removal of nonpassing vehicles accounted for a small portion of total benefits. In 1999, more than 90% of all HC and CO benefits and over 80% of all NO(x) benefits were attributed to vehicles more than 10 years old, even though such vehicles represented only half of those tested in the program.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "84492d85c9d3cfa01180a242d131d5459096a613", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2113597159", "DOI": "10.1109/66.554484", "CorpusId": 110751275}, "title": "Spatial characterization of wafer state using principal component analysis of optical emission spectra in plasma etch", "abstract": "Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is often used to obtain in-situ estimates of process parameters and conditions in plasma etch processes. Two barriers must be overcome to enable the use of such information for real-time process diagnosis and control. The first barrier is the large number of measurements in wide-spectrum scans, which hinders real-time processing. The second barrier is the need to understand and estimate not only process conditions, but also what is happening on the surface of wafer, particularly the spatial uniformity of the etch. This paper presents a diagnostic method that utilizes multivariable OES data collected during plasma etch to estimate spatial asymmetries in commercially available reactor technology. Key elements of this method are: first, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and second, regression and function approximation to correlate observed spatial wafer information (i.e., line width reduction) with these reduced measurements. Here we compare principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), and principal components combined with multilayer perceptron neural networks (PCA/MLP) for this in-situ estimation of spatial uniformity. This approach has been verified for a 0.35-/spl mu/m aluminum etch process using a Lam 9600 TCP etcher. Models of metal line width reduction across the wafer are constructed and compared: the root mean square prediction errors on a test set withheld from training are 0.0134 /spl mu/m for PCR, 0.014 /spl mu/m for PLS, and 0.016 /spl mu/m for PCA/MLP.

In the absence of UVR and the presence of visible light, mercury emission is very low (approximately0.3 ng/m2/h). When UVR is permitted in the mesocosm chambers, mercury emission increases, with emission rates ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 ng/m2/h. At concentrations between 1.5 and 2.5 mg/L DOC, mercury emission does not appear to depend on either the concentration or the optical properties of the DOC. In particular, the addition of 1.0 mg/L DOC from a nearby wetland to a photobleached mesocosm did not increase the emission of mercury. The similarities between mercury emission from highly photobleached 1.5 mg/L DOC and from terrestrially enriched 2.5 mg/L DOC suggest that the moieties responsible for mercury reduction are far in excess of that needed for mercury reduction. Using the measured flux rate of mercury from the water surface, we calculated a dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentration thatwould need to be present to drive the emissive flux.

These coronae extend outwards until either the pressure of the hot coronal gas overcomes the magnetic field, or, if the corona interacts with a disc before this happens, by the action of the disc itself. This work is motivated by the results of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project that show an increase in the X-ray emission measure (EM) with increasing stellar mass. We find that this variation (and its large scatter) results naturally from the variation in the sizes of the stellar coronae. The reduction in the magnitude of the X-ray emission due to the presence of a disc stripping the outer parts of the stellar corona is most pronounced for the lower mass stars. The higher mass stars with their greater surface gravities have coronae that typically do not extend out as far as the inner edge of the disc and so are less affected by it. For these stars, accretion takes place along open field lines that connect to the disc. By extrapolating surface magnetograms of young main-sequence stars, we have examined the effect on the X-ray emission of a realistic degree of field complexity. We find that the complex fields (which are more compact) give densities of some (2.5-0.6) x 10 10 cm -3 . This is consistent with density estimates of (1-8) x 10 10 cm -3 from modelling of individual flares. A simple dipole field in contrast gives densities typically an order of magnitude less. For the complex fields, we also find surface hotspots at a range of latitudes and longitudes with surface-filling factors of only a few per cent. We find that the dipolar fields give a relationship between X-ray EM and stellar mass that is somewhat steeper than observed, while the complex fields give a relation that is shallower than observed.

This paper analyses trends in adoption of national climate legislation and strategies, GHG targets, and renewable and energy efficiency targets in almost all UNFCCC Parties, focusing on the period from 2007 to 2017. The uniqueness and added value of this paper reside in its broad sweep of countries, the more than decade-long coverage and the use of objective metrics rather than normative judgements. Key results show that national climate legislation and strategies witnessed a strong increase in the first half of the assessed decade, likely due to the political lead up to the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009, but have somewhat stagnated in recent years, currently covering 70% of global GHG emissions (almost 50% of countries). In comparison, the coverage of GHG targets increased considerably in the run up to adoption of the Paris Agreement and 89% of global GHG emissions are currently covered by such targets. Renewable energy targets saw a steady spread, with 79% of the global GHG emissions covered in 2017 compared to 45% in 2007, with a steep increase in developing countries.

Here we report on simulations done by linking a Sectoral European Energy Model (SEEM), covering energy demand in nine Western European countries, with the emission-transport-deposition model RAINS developed by IIASA. The study analyses emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx, deposition of sulphur and nitrogen and the extent of areas where the critical load for sulphur is exceeded in year 2000 under four different energy scenarios. Two different sets of future behavioural patterns for the thermal electric power production sector are considered. In one regime, called the plan-efficient regime, the sector is assumed to follow official plans with regard to investment in new capacity. In the other regime, called the cost-efficient regime, the thermal power sector is assumed to behave in a cost minimizing manner. The effects of the proposed EC carbon/energy tax are studied under both regimes, giving rise to altogether four scenarios.In both regimes the effect of the EC tax is to reduce emissions by between 6 and 10 per cent in year 2000 relative to the scenarios without the tax. A change of regime, from the regulated, plan-efficient regime to the market-based, cost-efficient regime, will, by itself, reduce emissions of CO2 and NOx by approximately 3 per cent, while SO2 emissions are reduced by 13 per cent. The EC tax will reduce sulphur deposition by more than 5 per cent in the nine model countries under the plan-efficient regime. A change of regime further reduces the total deposition by 9 per cent. The area where depositions exceed the critical load is reduced by approximately 6 per cent in year 2000 by the tax in both regimes. Changing from the plan-efficient to the cost-efficient regime has a similar impact.Although the emission reductions due to the EC tax may seem modest, they are shown to have a sizeable effect on the technological abatement costs of reaching targets like those prescribed in the Sofia protocol on the stabilisation of NOx emissions, and the Helsinki protocol on SO2 emission reductions.

The Australian cotton industry must maintain product quality in order to remain globally competitive. In addition, carbon-conscious consumers need reassurance that the system used to grow the product is environmentally sustainable. The aim of the present study was to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to various farm inputs in three common types of cotton farming systems on the Darling Downs region, southern Queensland. Analysis revealed that GHG emissions for dryland solid-plant and dryland double-skip cotton farming systems are similar, but emissions are much higher for irrigated solid-plant cotton farming (1367, 1274 and 4841 kg CO2e/ha, respectively). However, if comparisons of GHG emissions are based on yield (per tonne), the positions of dryland double-skip farming and dryland solid-plant farming are reversed, but the position of irrigated cotton farming still remains as the highest GHG emitter. If the cotton industry comes under the Australian Government Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) without any subsidies and preconditions, and with a carbon price of A$25/t CO2e, the costs borne by each system would be A$66.8/t for the irrigated cotton industry, A$39.7/t for the dryland solid-plant cotton industry and A$43.6/t for the dryland double-skip cotton industry.

We found that adopting the most effective low-emission strategies requires joint efforts involving governance and management, enterprise operations, and consumer behavior change. With respect to issues of feasibility and effectiveness, the enterprise operation strategy, involving polices that shorten the pick-up time and increase the vehicle occupancy, is the best option, offering approximately 44% CO2 and NOx emission reductions compared with the current situation. Promoting ride-sourcing usage among car users or potential car users could help reduce emissions attributing to less cars being manufactured (26% CO2 and 24% NOx) but with uncertainty.

If firms are able to produce a lowemissions variety for regions imposing BCAs, results are similar to when firms regard BCAs as an output tax. If firms produce a single variety for all markets, BCAs result in larger leakage reductions than in standard approaches.

In a 4\u00d74 Latin square design 4 lactating Danish Holstein dairy cows fitted with rumen, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were assigned to 4 calcium ammonium nitrate addition levels: control, low, medium, and high [0, 5.3, 13.6, and 21.1g of nitrate/kg of dry matter (DM), respectively]. Diets were made isonitrogenous by replacing urea. Cows were fed ad libitum and, after a 6-d period of gradual introduction of nitrate, adapted to the corn-silage-based total mixed ration (forage:concentrate ratio 50:50 on DM basis) for 16d before sampling. Digesta content from duodenum, ileum, and feces, and rumen liquid were collected, after which methane production and hydrogen emissions were measured in respiration chambers. Methane production [L/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)] linearly decreased with increasing nitrate concentrations compared with the control, corresponding to a reduction of 6, 13, and 23% for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively. Methane production was lowered with apparent efficiencies (measured methane reduction relative to potential methane reduction) of 82.3, 71.9, and 79.4% for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively. Addition of nitrate increased hydrogen emissions (L/kg of DMI) quadratically by a factor of 2.5, 3.4, and 3.0 (as L/kg of DMI) for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively, compared with the control. Blood methemoglobin levels and nitrate concentrations in milk and urine increased with increasing nitrate intake, but did not constitute a threat for animal health and human food safety. Microbial crude protein synthesis and efficiency were unaffected.

Five PCM scenarios were employed. The first three were ensemble runs from 1995\u20132099 with a `business as usual' global emissions scenario, eachwith different atmospheric initializations. The fourth was a `control climate'scenario with greenhouse gas emissions set at 1995 levels and run through 2099. The fifth was a historical climate simulation forced with evolving greenhouse gas concentrations from 1870\u20132000, from which a 50-yearportion is taken for use in bias-correction of the other runs. From these global simulations, transient monthly temperature and precipitation sequences were statistically downscaled to produce continuous daily hydrologic model forcings, which drove a macro-scale hydrology model of theSacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Basins at a 1/8-degree spatial resolution, and produceddaily streamflow sequences for each climate scenario. Each streamflow scenario was used in a water resources system model that simulated current and predicted future performance of the system. The progressive warming of the PCM scenarios (approximately 1.2 \u00b0C at midcentury, and 2.2 \u00b0C by the 2090s), coupled with reductions in winter and spring precipitation (from 10 to 25%), markedly reduced late spring snowpack (by as much as half on average by the end of the century). Progressive reductions in winter, spring, and summer streamflow were less severe in the northern part of the study domain than in the south, where a seasonality shift was apparent. Results from the water resources system model indicate that achieving and maintaining status quo (control scenario climate) system performance in the future would be nearly impossible, given the altered climate scenario hydrologies. The most comprehensive of the mitigation alternatives examined satisfied only 87\u201396% of environmental targets in the Sacramento system, and less than 80% in the San Joaquin system.

The cost of tax exemptions with or without employment constraints is also examined. Using a computable general equilibrium model of the Swedish economy a wide range of emission reduction target levels are examined. The study finds that the reduction of CO2 emissions between 5 and 25 percent could be achieved at a cost up to 9 percent lower if taxes are used instead of (non-revenue raising) quantity regulations. Also, the removal of tax exemptions on certain industries could substantially lower the cost, even with employment constraints on these sectors. However, removing exemptions will have effect on other emissions such as SO2 and NOx. A tax structure similar to the one that arises from the use of tax exemptions could be motivated by additional emission reduction goals for these pollutants. Using monetary estimates for SO2, NOx and CO2 emission damages, the results indicate that a unilateral CO2 tax increase could yield a welfare improvement if valuation of CO2 emission reduction exceed 0.3 SEK per kg. \u2217 This study has been carried out as part of the project \u201cGreen Taxes: Environment, Employment and Growth\u201d (ENV4-CT96-0231).

Although the global burden of BC from fossil fuel and biofuel in- creases, in the Arctic the maximum atmospheric BC burden as well as in the snow was reached in 1960s, with a slight reduction thereafter. The global mean burden of BC from open biomass burning sources has not changed significantly since 1900. With current inventories of emissions from open biomass sources, the modelled burden of BC in snow and in the atmosphere north of 65 N is small compared to the BC burden of fossil fuel and biofuel origin.

Results for November and February 2010 are analyzed, respectively representing the start and end of the biomass burning season in the study region. For February 2010, estimates of total smoke emission vary by a factor of 12, but only differences by factors of 7 or less are found in the simulated regional (15\u00b0W\u201342\u00b0E, 13\u00b0S\u201317\u00b0N) and monthly averages of column PM2.5 loading, surface PM2.5 concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), smoke radiative forcing at the top-of-atmosphere and at the surface, and air temperature at 2 m and at 700 hPa. The smaller differences in these simulated variables may reflect the atmospheric diffusion and deposition effects to dampen the large difference in smoke emissions that are highly concentrated in areas much smaller than the regional domain of the study. Indeed, at the local scale, large differences (up to a factor of 33) persist in simulated smoke-related variables and radiative effects including semi-direct effect. Similar results are also found for November 2010, despite differences in meteorology and fire activity. Hence, biomass burning emission uncertainties have a large influence on the reliability of model simulations of atmospheric aerosol loading, transport, and radiative impacts, and this influence is largest at local and hourly-to-daily scales.

This study reviews the literature on how policymakers can design climate policies and their nationally determined contributions to reach zero\u2010net emissions before the end of the century in a socially and politically acceptable manner. To get the ambition right, policymakers can use sectoral roadmaps with targets and indicators that track progress toward zero emissions (e.g., regarding renewable power or reforestation). Indeed, monitoring economy\u2010wide emissions\u2010reductions alone would not ensure that short\u2010term action contributes meaningfully to the long\u2010term decarbonization goal. To get the political economy right, climate policies can be designed so that they contribute to nonclimate objectives and create broad coalitions of supporters. For instance, carbon taxes revenues can fund social assistance and infrastructure investment, while reducing tax evasion and informality. To minimize social and economic disruptions and avoid stranded assets, policymakers can also start with a low carbon price level and use complementary policies. Designed at the sector level, complementary policies such as performance standards or feebates for cars, building norms, or moratoriums on new coal power plants can be negotiated in partnership with local stakeholders and trigger a transition to zero carbon that does not directly affect existing polluting capital.

This model is used to investigate the sensitivity of tropospheric ozone with respect to (1) changes in the anthropogenic emission of nitrogen oxides and nonmethane hydrocarbons, (2) increases in methane concentrations, (3) variations in the stratospheric source of ozone, (4) changes in solar radiation resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion, and (5) increases in tropospheric temperatures. Model results indicate that local increases in NOx emissions have caused most of the increases seen in lower tropospheric ozone over Europe and Japan. Increases in methane are responsible for roughly one fifth of the anthropogenically induced increase in tropospheric ozone at northern midlatitudes. However, changes in ozone precursors do not adequately explain either the spatial differences in observed ozone trends across midlatitudes or the observed decreases in ozone over Canada throughout the troposphere. We argue that ozone depletion in the lowermost stratosphere is likely to have reduced the stratospheric source by as much as 30% from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s. Model simulations that account for such a reduction along with reported changes in anthropogenic emissions show steep declines of ozone in the upper troposphere and variable increases in the lower troposphere that are more consistent with observations. Differential temperature trends in summer between North America and Europe may account for at least some of the remaining spatial variation in tropospheric ozone trends.

Here, we estimate the system-level cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions with flexible CCS compared to redispatching (i.e., substituting gas- for coal-fired electricity generation), wind, and normal CCS under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical more stringent CO2 emission reduction target (\"stronger CPP\"). Using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model, we find flexible CCS achieves more cost-effective emission reductions than normal CCS under both reduction targets, indicating that policies that promote CCS should encourage flexible CCS.

Terrestrial carbon sinks could be a low\u2010cost mitigation option that fosters conservation and development, yet issues related to accurately documenting the amount of carbon sequestered undermine confidence that emission offsets through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions. From an atmospheric perspective, net of CO2 removals through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions over a given period of time. But carbon will not remain sequestered in biomass or soils indefinitely and investments in sequestration could stifle investments in reducing emissions from other sources. Many international climate agreements cap emissions from some countries or sectors but enable participation of uncapped countries or sectors for forestry and agricultural sequestration. This structure can prompt emission increases in parts of the uncapped entities that weaken the value of emission reductions earned through sequestration.

Statistical analysis showed that 96% of mean square prediction error for feces and urine N output predictions was due to random variation. However, the model tends to overpredict milk N output, especially at higher N intake levels. Evaluation of model predictions for independent experimental observations from Agricultural Development Advisory Service at Bridgets (U.K.) showed good agreement between predicted and observed urine N output (95% due to random variation).

The model predictions of N outputs in excreta were sensitive to changes in energy concentration of the diet. Dietary protein degradability had only a small influence on predicted fecal N output. However, the model was sensitive in its predictions of urine N when protein degradability was varied. Application of the model to assess reduction in ammonia emissions from dairy cows showed that increasing the energy concentration could potentially reduce ammonia emissions by up to 25% per cow. Similarly, reducing CP concentration in the diet to about 16% could reduce ammonia production by 20% and lower degradability of CP to match microbial requirement by 19% per cow.

I. Effects of decreasing L2 below L1.", "abstract": "The 2f1-f2 distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) is evoked by two primary tones of frequencies f1 < f2, and levels L1 and L2. Previous reports indicate that decreasing L2 below L1 = L2 can; (1) increase DPOAE amplitude in normal ears, and (2) increase the degree to which DPOAE amplitudes are reduced by cochlear trauma. Although both of these factors could be advantageous for clinical applications of DPOAEs, neither has been explored in detail. In the present study, 2f1-f2 DPOAE-amplitude frequency functions were collected from normal and impaired ears of rabbits and humans, with L1 = L2, and with L2 < L1, at each of three values of L1. In rabbits, controlled tonal or noise overexposures were used to produce permanent reductions of DPOAE amplitudes. Comparison of pre- and postexposure DPOAE-amplitude frequency functions demonstrated that the frequency-specific reductions of DPOAEs were enhanced by decreasing L2 below L1. In humans, DPOAE-amplitude frequency functions obtained with the various L1 and L2 combinations were collected from 16 normal ears to provide preliminary normative data for each stimulus-level condition. The L1-L2 that produced the maximum DPOAE amplitude in normal ears was systematically dependent on L1. Thus at most frequencies, decreasing L2 below L1 = L2 substantially reduced mean DPOAE amplitude when L1 > or = 75 dB SPL, but increased mean DPOAE amplitudes at L1 = 65 dB SPL. However, the increase of mean DPOAE amplitude obtained by decreasing L2 below L1 = 65 dB SPL was small, being less than 3.5 dB at most frequencies. More importantly, at L1 = 65 dB SPL, L2 could be decreased considerably below L1 = L2 without reducing mean DPOAE amplitude relative to that at L1 = L2. Inspection of DPOAE-amplitude frequency functions obtained from subjects with mild or moderate sensorineural hearing losses indicated that, in frequency regions of hearing impairment, decreasing L2 below L1 can enhance the degree of reduction of DPOAEs below the corresponding normative amplitudes, without reducing the normative amplitude. It is concluded that decreasing L2 below L1 = L2 has the potential to enhance the performance of DPOAEs in clinical applications.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "e95740bc8910736fa6e448144532c3baf53539a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1996912394", "DOI": "10.2202/1935-1682.2552", "CorpusId": 153784333}, "title": "What are the Costs of Meeting Distributional Objectives for Climate Policy?", "abstract": "Abstract This paper develops an analytical model to quantify the costs and distributional effects of various fiscal options for allocating the large rents created under proposed cap-and-trade programs to reduce domestic, energy-related CO2 emissions.

The main contribution of this paper is the use of a Generalized Divisia Index Model for the first time to factorize the change of carbon emissions in China\u2019s power industry from 2000 to 2015, and gives full consideration to the influence of the economy, population, and energy consumption on the carbon emissions. At the same time, the Monte Carlo method is first used to predict the carbon emissions of the power industry from 2017 to 2030 under three different scenarios. The results show that the output scale is the most important factor leading to an increase in carbon emissions in China\u2019s power industry from 2000 to 2015, followed by the energy consumption scale and population size. Energy intensity levels have always promoted carbon emissions reduction in the power industry, where energy intensity and carbon intensity effects of energy consumption have great potential to mitigate carbon levels.

Flexible modelling approaches are presented for both instruments, with which all impacts on the energy system can be evaluated endogenously. It is shown that national climate policy measures can have an effect on the supranational emissions trading system by increasing emission reduction in the German electricity sector by up to 79 MtCO2 in 2030. As a result, emission certificate prices decline by between 1.9 \u20ac/tCO2 and 6.1 \u20ac/tCO2 and the burden sharing between participating countries changes, but no additional emission reduction is achieved at the European level. This also implies, however, that the cost efficiency of such a cap-and-trade system is distorted, with additional costs of the FIT system of up to \u20ac320 billion compared with lower costs for ETS emission certificates of between \u20ac44 billion and \u20ac57 billion (cumulated over the period 2013\u20132020).

The maximum NO\u2093 and SO2 removal efficiencies were achieved at an application rate of 0.05 L/m\u00b2. The efficiency of NO\u2093 reduction is affected by the flow rate of the pollutant, relative humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) light intensity. In the field, NO\u2093 concentrations were monitored for both the coated and uncoated sections to directly measure photocatalytic degradation. Furthermore, nitrates were collected from the coated and uncoated areas for evidence of photocatalytic NO\u2093 reduction. Results from both approaches show evidence of photocatalytic NO\u2093 reduction. Further field evaluation is needed to determine the durability of the surface coating.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "698f2ea647f75586c60e772d1d1b5d1c07f9eab2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2738459632", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-017-2027-8", "CorpusId": 157908515}, "title": "Early action on Paris Agreement allows for more time to change energy systems", "abstract": "The IMAGE integrated assessment model was used to develop a set of scenarios to evaluate the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties under the Paris Agreement.

This paper details typical emissions from present\u2013day power stations and discusses the options for their reduction. Acknowledging that the cuts achieved in the past decade in the UK CO2 emissions have been achieved largely by fuel switching, the remaining possibilities offered by this method are discussed. Switching to less\u2013polluting fossil fuels will achieve some measure of reduction, but the basic problem of CO2 emissions continues. Of the alternatives to fossil fuels, only nuclear power represents a zero\u2013carbon large\u2013scale energy source. Unfortunately, public concerns over safety and radioactive waste have still to be assuaged. Other approaches include the application of improved combustion technology, the removal of harmful gases from power\u2013station flues and the use of waste heat to improve overall power\u2013station efficiency. These all have a part to play, but many consider our best hope for emissions reduction to be the use of renewable energy. The main renewable energy contenders are assessed in this paper and realistic estimates of the contribution that each could provide are indicated. It appears that, in the time\u2013scale envisaged by planners for reduction in CO2 emission, in many countries renewable energy will be unlikely to deliver. At the same time, it is worth commenting that, again in many countries, the level of penetration of renewable energy will fall short of the present somewhat optimistic targets. Of renewable options, wind energy could be used in the short to medium term to cover for thermal plant closures, but for wind energy to be successful, the network will have to be modified to cope with wind's intermittent nature. Globally, hydroelectricity is currently the largest developed source of renewable electricity, but future large\u2013scale projects will probably be limited to the less\u2013developed world: the best schemes in the developed countries have already been exploited. Wave and tidal can be looked on as medium\u2013 to long\u2013term generators of electricity, as their respective industries are not as mature as competing renewable resources. Municipal solid\u2013waste combustion and landfill gas technologies can also be seen as short term, as can their rural equivalents, agriculture and forestry waste. Any widespread exploitation of renewable energy will depend on being able to transmit the energy from source to point of use, so the implications for the electrical network from the penetration of substantial levels of renewable energy are presented. Effective management of renewable energy installations will require technical assessment of the range of exploitation strategies, to compare local production of, say, hydrogen and the more traditional transmission of electricity. Such resources will have to compete with others in any national, or grid, system and detailed economic analysis will be necessary to determine the deployment that best fits the trading regime under which the energy will be sold. Consideration will also be necessary to determine how best to control the introduction of this radically new resource such that it does not attract punitive cost overheads until it is mature enough to cope. Finally, it is inescapable that nuclear power is a proven technology that could take its place in any future generation portfolio. Unfortunately, suspicion and mistrust surround waste management and radioactivity release. Unless this is overcome, the lack of confidence engendered by this public mistrust may result in few, if any, new nuclear power stations being built. In the event of that decision, it is difficult to see how CO2 levels can be significantly reduced: the irony is that nuclear energy may emerge as environmentally essential.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "78f564b20e874ee9a370c46cc1a4788f549c45d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2155850150", "DOI": "10.1099/mic.0.2008/017608-0", "CorpusId": 15933712, "PubMed": "18667551"}, "title": "Biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS) of petrodiesel fuels.", "abstract": "Oil refineries are facing many challenges, including heavier crude oils, increased fuel quality standards, and a need to reduce air pollution emissions. Global society is stepping on the road to zero-sulfur fuel, with only differences in the starting point of sulfur level and rate reduction of sulfur content between different countries. Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is the most common technology used by refineries to remove sulfur from intermediate streams. However, HDS has several disadvantages, in that it is energy intensive, costly to install and to operate, and does not work well on refractory organosulfur compounds. Recent research has therefore focused on improving HDS catalysts and processes and also on the development of alternative technologies. Among the new technologies one possible approach is biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS). The advantage of BDS is that it can be operated in conditions that require less energy and hydrogen. BDS operates at ambient temperature and pressure with high selectivity, resulting in decreased energy costs, low emission, and no generation of undesirable side products.

The model is based on a detailed global environmentally extended supply\u2013use table (EE SUT) for the year 2000, called EXIOBASE. This global EE SUT allows calculating how the final demand in each region drives activities in production sectors, and hence related CO2 emissions, in each region. Using this SUT framework, three scenarios have been constructed for the year 2050. The first is a business-as-usual scenario (BAU), which takes into account population, economic growth, and efficiency improvements. The second is a techno-scenario (TS), adding feasible and probable climate mitigation technologies to the BAU scenario. The third is the towards-2-degrees scenario (2DS), with a demand shift or growth reduction scenario added to the TS to create a 2 \u00b0C scenario. The emission results of the three scenarios are roughly in line with outcomes of typical scenarios from integrated assessment models. Our approach indicates that the 2 \u00b0C target seems difficult to reach with advanced CO2 emission reduction technologies alone. Policy relevance The overall outlook in this scenario study is not optimistic. We show that CO2 emissions from steel and cement production and air and sea transport will become dominant in 2050. They are difficult to reduce further. Using biofuels in air and sea transport will probably be problematic due to the fact that agricultural production largely will be needed to feed a rising global population and biofuel use for electricity production grows substantially in 2050. It seems that a more pervasive pressure towards emission reduction is required, also influencing the basic fabric of society in terms of types and volumes of energy use, materials use, and transport.

In order to probe the mechanism that leads to NIR emission in bismuth-containing glasses, femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation was used.

Bi+ species are, therefore, proposed as the major origin of NIR emission from Bi-doped glasses.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "c86f9685a76dd6d582a343eb9030f205909fc224", "externalIds": {"MAG": "51340404", "DOI": "10.1007/978-0-585-29606-7_6", "CorpusId": 126765481}, "title": "Energy Policy: Fairy Tales and Factualities", "abstract": "A brief survey of tools developed over the past few decades for the analysis of energy systems is presented. It is essential that exergy analysis be used to determine the value of energy lost in processes. Scenarios based upon economic parameters are not useful for the analysis of long-term developments. Backcasting using physical parameters is more acceptable for a long-term policy development. A few aspects of the greenhouse effect are summarised. It is shown that prejudices and misconceptions about the greenhouse effect and about energy efficiencies can lead to useless activities. Some of these activities exclude policy actions which are necessary to achieve a considerable reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the future.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "e26490715abf8350d442671d4a61858ae0440080", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2295754220", "CorpusId": 163994958}, "title": "Quelle contribution de l'agriculture fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction des \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre?

Two distinct edge emission spectra have been found indicating that two different types of single crystals exist. For type I crystals the edge emission spectrum at 4.2\u00b0K contains 10 lines located between 4400 A and 4800 A; at 77\u00b0K the emission spectrum contains two lines. For type II crystals the edge emission spectrum at 4.2\u00b0K contains 14 lines located between 4400 A and 4900 A; at 77\u00b0K the emission spectrum contains three lines, one of which is located at the fundamental absorption edge of the crystal. Both crystal emissions show evidence of phonon interaction with the ZnSe lattice and both emissions undergo significant reductions in intensity as the crystal temperature increases from 4.2\u00b0 to 77\u00b0K.", "year": 1961}]}
