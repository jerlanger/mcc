Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is essential: The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that meeting the G-8's emission-reductions goal will require reducing annual GHG emissions from the building sector by 8.2 billion tons by 2050 below business as usual. While previous studies have shown that the cost of emissions abatement in the buildings sector is cheaper than in many other sectors, few studies have attempted to model what policies will be required to reduce building-sector emissions in line with the IEA's calculations. Trevor Houser, expanding on his earlier PIIE policy brief, uses the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) model to study the economics of improving building-sector energy efficiency. Houser agrees with previous studies that the GHG abatement costs of improved building efficiency are cheaper than the abatement costs in other sectors (though more expensive than previous studies suggest), but he finds significant barriers to investments in energy efficiency. A carbon price alone--a key part of any successful climate policy--will not be enough to overcome these barriers, and complementary measures, such as improved financing approaches and enhanced standards and codes for building energy efficiency, will be needed to incentivize long-term building-sector investments and to meet the emission-reductions goals outlined by the IEA.

Noxious thermal stimulation was applied at the same temperature for placebo and control conditions. Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a number of predicted \u03bc-opioid receptor-rich regions that play central roles in pain and affect, including periaqueductal gray and nearby dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, rostral anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex. These regions appeared to be subdivided into two sets, one showing placebo-induced opioid activation specific to noxious heat and the other showing placebo-induced opioid reduction during warm stimulation in anticipation of pain. These findings suggest that a mechanism of placebo analgesia is the potentiation of endogenous opioid responses to noxious stimuli. Opioid activity in many of these regions was correlated with placebo effects in reported pain. Connectivity analyses on individual differences in endogenous opioid system activity revealed that placebo treatment increased functional connectivity between the periaqueductal gray and rostral anterior cingulate, as hypothesized a priori, and also increased connectivity among a number of limbic and prefrontal regions, suggesting increased functional integration of opioid responses.

A simple plume implementation of the second version (v2) of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, MACv2-SP, is described. MACv2-SP provides a prescription of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect. It was created to provide a harmonized description of post-1850 anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing for climate modeling studies. MACv2-SP has been designed to be easy to implement, change and use, and thereby enable studies exploring the climatic effects of different patterns of aerosol radiative forcing, including a Twomey effect. MACv2-SP is formulated in terms of nine spatial plumes associated with different major anthropogenic source regions. The shape of the plumes is fit to the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 2, whose present-day (2005) distribution is anchored by surface-based observations. Two types of plumes are considered: one predominantly associated with biomass burning, the other with industrial emissions. These differ in the prescription of their annual cycle and in their optical properties, thereby implicitly accounting for different contributions of absorbing aerosol to the different plumes. A Twomey effect for each plume is prescribed as a change in the host model's background cloud-droplet population density using relationships derived from satellite data. Year-to-year variations in the amplitude of the plumes over the historical period (1850\u20132016) are derived by scaling the plumes with associated national emission sources of SO2 and NH3. Experiments using MACv2-SP are performed with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The globally and annually averaged instantaneous and effective aerosol radiative forcings are estimated to be \u22120.6 and \u22120.5\u202fW\u202fm\u22122, respectively. Forcing from aerosol\u2013cloud interactions (the Twomey effect) offsets the reduction of clear-sky forcing by clouds, so that the net effect of clouds on the aerosol forcing is small; hence, the clear-sky forcing, which is more readily measurable, provides a good estimate of the total aerosol forcing.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "24c5b0415946d00de557ee430ac1efbadcdd5a6c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2328886826", "DOI": "10.1177/1475090214522778", "CorpusId": 113124414}, "title": "Overview of alternative fuels with emphasis on the potential of liquefied natural gas as future marine fuel", "abstract": "Economic and population growths are the most important drivers of growing global energy demand. They led to a rapid development of international seaborne trade and an increase in the number of global vessels.

In this study, we will first review the current global energy demand and its driving forces over next decades, second evaluate the existing alternative fuels that can be used as a bunker fuel to reach sustainability with relatively small changes in the existing marine propulsion options and finally focus on near-term solution, which has the potential for large-scale use. The different alternative fuels were compared in terms of several parameters such as availability, renewability, safety, cost, performance, economy and compliance with emission regulations. This comparison revealed that liquefied natural gas could be considered as the future replacement to the current marine bunker fuel. This conclusion has been further verified by comparing diesel engine with different powers when using both heavy fuel oil and liquefied natural gas. The engines were compared against fuel consumption, cost saving as well as emissions. Liquefied natural gas has proved to be better than heavy fuel oil due to fuel cost reduction by about 31% per year and decrease in emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2 and particulate matter by about 98%, 86%, 11% and 96%, respectively.

This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery.

From these experiments we conclude that [11C]PHNO is a D3 preferring agonist, and that this property explains the high GP signal not observed with [11C]raclopride or [11C]NPA.

It is known that the activity of the cochlear amplifier can be modulated by efferent neurons of the medial olivocochlear complex. We used distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements to monitor cochlear activity during an intermodal cueing paradigm.

Primary auditory cortex activity, as measured by the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), differed between conditions, with higher ASSRs during auditory than visual attention. Furthermore, the analysis of cortical oscillatory activity revealed increased alpha power over occipitoparietal and frontal regions during auditory compared with visual attention, putatively reflecting suppression of visual processing.

While societal impact and therefore emission limit values are to be reduced in big steps, continuous improvement is not enough but technological quantum leaps are necessary. The introduction and refinement of electronic control of all major engine systems has already been a quantum leap forward. Maximizing the benefits of these technologies to customers and society requires full use of parameter optimization and other enabling technologies. The next big step forward will be widespread use of exhaust aftertreatment on all transportation related diesel engines. While exhaust gas aftertreatment has been successfully established on gasoline (Otto cycle) engines, the introduction of exhaust aftertreatment especially for heavy-duty diesel engines will be much mo re demanding. Implementing exhaust gas aftertreatment into commercial vehicle applications is a challenging task but the emission requirements to be met starting in Europe, the USA and Japan in the 2005-2007 timeframe require this step. The engine industry will be able to implement the new technology if all stakeholders support the necessary decisions. One decision hasmore\u00a0\u00bb already been taken: the reduction of sulfur in diesel fuel being comparable with the elimination of lead in gasoline as a prerequisite for the three-way catalyst. Now we have the chance to optimize ecology and economy of the Diesel engine simultaneously by taking the decision to provide an additional infrastructure for a NOx reduction agent needed for the introduction of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology that is already implemented in the electric power generation industry. This requires some effort, but the resulting societal benefits, fuel economy and vehicle life cycle costs are significantly better when compared to other competitive technologies. After long discussions this decision for SCR has been made in Europe and is supported by all truck and engine manufacturers. The necessary logistic support will be in place when it will be needed commercially in 2005. For the US the decision has to be taken this year in order to have the infrastructure available in 2007.

Emission factors were based as far as possible on relevant data sourced from either the literature or databases used in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models. The results were compared with those from a desktop simulation approach for a range of WWTP configurations that formed the basis for an LCA study of the trade-offs between nutrient removal and total environmental burden. The results from the actual operating plants compared well in general terms with those from the desktop study, although some differences in points of detail were highlighted. In either case, significant uncertainties in GHG emission estimates were apparent in respect of so-called \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from WWTP operations since both of these gases are major greenhouse contributors. Additional research will be required in this area in order to improve the accuracy of emissions reporting from the wastewater sector. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the data suggested that imported electrical power and biosolids treatment/ disposal operations are the largest potential sources of greenhouse gas. Opportunities for significant reductions (approx. 20 to 40%) in total GHG emissions exist with the inclusion primary sedimentation, anaerobic digestion and power generation from biogas in the WWTP flow sheet. Addition of chemicals (with embodied GHG emissions) to supplement nutrient removal does not cancel out this reduction. However, from a global perspective, the LCA study has shown that GHG emissions represent only a minor (indicatively <1%) of the normalised total environmental impacts from WWTP operations. Eutrophication and potential human health or ecotoxicity impacts associated with the disposal of biosolids (particularly due to the metals content) are the dominant impacts.

The budgets were nevertheless considered sufficiently reliable to quantify the major flows. Agriculture was responsible for the majority of inputs, though fisheries and energy generation also made significant contributions. Agriculture was the main source of N input to the aquatic environment, whereas agriculture, energy generation and transport all contributed to emissions of reactive N gases to the atmosphere. Significant reductions in inputs of reactive N have been achieved during the 20 years, mainly by restricting the use of N for crop production and improving livestock feeding. This reduction has helped reduce nitrate leaching by about half. Measures to limit ammonia emissions from agriculture and mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from energy generation and transport, has reduced gaseous emissions of reactive N. Much N flows through the food and feed processing industries and there is a cascade of N through the consumer to solid and liquid waste management systems.

At the heart of this discussion is the issue of crediting of emissions reductions. Projects can be correctly, over- or under-credited for their actual emissions reductions. We develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. In the context of a national carbon pricing scheme that includes offsets, we find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. In the presence of high predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions uncertainty or low carbon prices, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set at stringent levels, in some cases below 50 percent of predicted BAU emissions. As predicted BAU emissions uncertainty declines or as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, however, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. These results imply that to maintain environmental integrity of offsets programs, baseline stringency should be tailored to project characteristics and market conditions that influence the proportion of over-credited offsets to under-credited emissions reductions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2a2c36c683a15557801bfb81ac8bb2aaddbdee0e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016144559", "DOI": "10.1021/MA0107051", "CorpusId": 94918385}, "title": "Thiophene-Based Conjugated Polymers for Light-Emitting Diodes: Effect of Aryl Groups on Photoluminescence Efficiency and Redox Behavior", "abstract": "An efficient and convenient approach to a series of soluble conjugated polymers, poly[(4-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)(arylene)(4-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)]s, has been developed.

Despite this concern, the global rate of addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuel, now approaching 10 Gton C/yr, continues to increase, and at an accelerating rate (Fig. 1a). Although many still hope and believe that carbon emissions can be arrested at near the current rates, and decreased over the remainder of the 21st century, there is as yet little evidence that this is going to occur.\n\nThe driver for carbon emissions is a globally increasing demand for energy, and the fact that energy can be produced relatively inexpensively and with well-developed technology by burning coal, oil and natural gas. Given that the focus on fossil fuel energy is not lessening to an appreciable degree (Fig. 1b), it is not only prudent, but necessary to have the technology to reduce the carbon emissions associated with fossil fuel burning. This reduction can potentially be accomplished with large-scale carbon capture and storage, where carbon dioxide would be captured from the flue gases of electric power generation facilities, purified, compressed, and injected underground as a supercritical fluid into porous geologic rock formations (Oelkers and Cole 2008). To be effective in reducing carbon accumulation in the atmosphere, this injected or \u201cstored\u201d CO2 must remain underground for thousands of years with only insignificant amounts of leakage back to the surface (Benson and Cook 2005).

In regard to pollution emissions, the coal addition contributed to the tailing peak of SO2 emission during co-combustion, which may influence the desulfurization process.

We investigate the nature of the X-ray point source population within the Young Massive Cluster Westerlund 1. Methods. Chandra observations of 18 ks and 42 ks were used to determine the X-ray properties of emitters within Wd 1, while a comprehensive multiwavelength dataset was employed to constrain their nature. Results. We find X-ray emission from a multitude of different stellar sources within Wd 1, including both evolved high mass and low mass pre-MS stars. We attribute the X-ray emission from the high mass component to both single stars and colliding wind binaries on the basis of their observed flux and spectral properties, with binaries being systematically harder and more luminous than single stars. We are able to infer a high binary fraction for both WN (10/16) and WC stars (7/8), resulting in a combined Wolf Rayet binary fraction of >70%. These represent the most stringent limits currently placed on the binary fraction of very massive (>45 M\ufffd ) stars. We place the first observational constraints on X-ray emission from stars transitioning between the Main Sequence and Wolf Rayet phases, finding that both hot (B hypergiants) and cool (yellow hypergiants and red supergiants) spectral types appear to be intrinsically X-ray faint. The B[e] star W9 is found to be X-ray bright and shows similarities to both the X-ray binary SS433 and the Luminous Blue Variable \u03b7 Carinae. Globally, we find the point source population to be systematically fainter than those found in younger massive star forming regions such as NGC 3603 and R136/30 Doradus, consistent with a loss of the most massive stars to SNe and a reduction in emissivity from the low mass pre-Main Sequence stars. No unambiguous evidence for X-ray emission due to accretion onto relativistic objects of any mass is found, although the current data do not exclude the presence of either a High Mass X-ray Binary or an Intermediate Mass Black Hole accreting at a low rate. Finally, we suggest the progenitor mass for the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 is comparable to that of SGR 1806-20 (\u223c55 M\ufffd ), while that for SGR 1900+14 appears significantly lower (\u223c15 M\ufffd ), implying that magnetars may form from stars with a wide range of initial masses.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "e0fbca779de352ef66aba84873494369ac45f59b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2888257790", "DOI": "10.3386/W24923", "CorpusId": 158393651}, "title": "Per Capita Income, Consumption Patterns, and Co2 Emissions", "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of income-driven differences in consumption patterns in explaining and projecting energy demand and CO2 emissions.

Consumption of energy goods is less than proportional to income in rich countries, and more income-elastic in low-income countries. While income effects are weaker for embodied energy, we find a significant negative relationship between income elasticity and CO2 intensity across all goods. These income-driven differences in consumption choices can partially explain the observed inverted-U relationship between income and emissions across countries, the so-called environmental Kuznet curve.

It is concluded that 15% of the decrease can be attributed to the drop in demand for electricity triggered by the economic recession, and 28% can be attributed to switching of fuel from coal to gas responding to the decrease in prices for the latter. The largest factor in the decrease, close to 57%, resulted from an overall decline in emissions per unit of power generated from coal. This is attributed in part to selective idling of older, less efficient coal plants that generally do not incorporate technology for sulfur removal, and in part to continued investments by the power sector in removal equipment in response to the requirements limiting emissions imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).

The model is used to explain the observed emission trends of nitric and nitrous oxides as a function of bed temperature, excess air and operating pressure. Reduction of nitrogen oxides in the bed results in only a small fraction of the nitrogen oxides formed by coal oxidation being emitted from the bed. At low temperatures the concentration of CO in the bed is higher than at high temperatures; this enhances NO reduction via the catalytic NO/CO destruction reaction. Increases in N 2 O destruction rates at high temperatures lead to reductions in its emissions. As the excess air ratio is raised, the bed char loading falls, with a consequent fall in the reduction of nitrogen oxides over bed char and higher emissions. At elevated operating pressures both the char loading and the residence time of gases in the bed govern the emissions. The emissions of nitric oxide fall inversely with pressure, whereas the emissions of nitrous oxide, a product formed by NO destruction on char, pass through a maximum. Emissions of nitrogen oxides can be explained in terms of a competition between the formation and destruction reactions.

For farming systems, the inter-system variability is investigated through differentiating the production mode (conventional, quality label, organic (OA)), and the farmer practices (Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) versus Over Fertilised (OF)), while for natural systems, variability due to physical and climatic characteristics of catchments expected to modify nitrate fate is explored. Results and Conclusion For the eutrophication and climate change impact categories, the uncertainty associated with field emissions contributes more to the overall uncertainty than the uncertainty associated with emissions from livestock buildings, with crop yield and with feed efficiency. For acidification, the uncertainty of emissions from livestock buildings is the single most important contributor to the overall uncertainty. The influence of the FU on eutrophication results is very important when comparing systems with different degrees of intensification such as GAP and OA. Concerning the inter-system variability, differences in farmer practices have a larger effect on eutrophication than differences between production modes. Finally, the physical characteristics of the catchment and the climate strongly affect the results for eutrophication. In conclusion, in this case study, the main sources of uncertainty are in the estimation of emission factors, due both to the variability of environmental conditions and to lack of knowledge (emissions of N2O at the field level), but also in the model used for assessing regional impacts such as eutrophication.Recommendation and Perspective Suitable deterministic simulation models integrating the main controlling variables (environmental conditions, farmer practices, technology used) should be used to predict the emissions of a given system as well as their probabilistic distribution allowing the use of stochastic modelling. Finally, our simulations on eutrophication illustrate the necessity of integrating the fate of pollutants in models of impact assessment and highlight the important margin of improvement existing for the eutrophication impact assessment model.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "9e3becf352861c0dbaa9c7969efb4f89becfee80", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2063997025", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.120410", "CorpusId": 15137628, "PubMed": "23095282"}, "title": "Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-&agr; Therapy Reduces Aortic Inflammation and Stiffness in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis", "abstract": "Background\u2014Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory condition associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This is not fully explained by traditional risk factors, but direct vascular inflammation and aortic stiffening may play a role. We hypothesized that patients with RA exhibit aortic inflammation, which can be reversed with anti-tumor necrosis factor-&agr; therapy and correlates with aortic stiffness reduction. Methods and Results\u2014Aortic inflammation was quantified in 17 patients with RA, before and after 8 weeks of anti-tumor necrosis factor-&agr; therapy by using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography coregistration. Concomitantly, 34 patients with stable cardiovascular disease were imaged as positive controls at baseline. Aortic fluorodeoxyglucose target-to-background ratios (TBRs) and aortic pulse wave velocity were assessed. RA patients had higher baseline aortic TBRs in comparison with patients who have cardiovascular disease (2.02\u00b10.22 versus 1.74\u00b10.22, P=0.0001). Following therapy, aortic TBR fell to 1.90\u00b10.29, P=0.03, and the proportion of inflamed aortic slices (defined as TBR >2.0) decreased from 50\u00b133% to 33\u00b127%, P=0.03. Also, TBR in the most diseased segment of the aorta fell from 2.51\u00b10.33 to 2.05\u00b10.29, P<0.0001. Treatment also reduced aortic pulse wave velocity significantly (from 9.09\u00b11.77 to 8.63\u00b11.42 m/s, P=0.04), which correlated with the reduction of aortic TBR (R=0.60, P=0.01). Conclusions\u2014This study demonstrates that RA patients have increased aortic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in comparison with patients who have stable cardiovascular disease. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-&agr; therapy reduces aortic inflammation in patients with RA, and this effect correlates with the decrease in aortic stiffness.

To achieve a net reduction in emissions any gains in soil organic carbon storage cannot come at the expense of enhanced nitrous oxide emissions from the soil. In non-level agricultural landscapes of the Canadian Prairies the potential for significant soil organic carbon gain due to adoption of soil conserving practices is greatest on convex upper slope positions, which have experienced major losses of soil organic carbon due to cultivation. The potential for soil organic carbon gain in lower slope positions is limited due to their high soil organic carbon contents, but targeted wetland and riparian vegetation restoration programs could lead to significant above ground carbon gains. Several studies have shown that emissions of nitrous oxide from lower slope positions are significantly higher than the convex slope positions, and that improvements in nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency through site-specific management has the potential to significantly reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from these positions. Because of the close relationship between landform position and the key carbon and nitrogen processes, quantitative landform segmentation procedures can be used to delineate precision conservation management zones in these landscapes. Site-specific management practices such as reduced or no-till, seeding to grass, wetland restoration, and site-specific nitrogen (N) management can then be implemented to simultaneously increase soil organic carbon stores on eroded upper slope segments while preserving existing stores of soil organic carbon and reducing N2O emissions from lower slope segments. Close cooperation between precision conservation professionals and agronomists is required to ensure that information required by producers is available to guide them in their decision making and implementation of precision conservation for co-management of carbon and nitrogen.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "a5c76a8a5562319515e7f700d852e8dc7f1a5ce5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1570986866", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1742-7843.2007.00168.x", "CorpusId": 20099178, "PubMed": "18226075"}, "title": "Health effects of early life exposure to arsenic.", "abstract": "Inorganic arsenic is a potent human carcinogen and general toxicant.

Vehicles from different vocations that included goods movement, refuse trucks, and transit buses were tested on driving cycles representative of their duty cycle. The natural gas vehicle technologies included the stoichiometric engine platform equipped with a three-way catalyst and a diesel-like dual-fuel high-pressure direct-injection technology equipped with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The diesel vehicles were equipped with a DPF and SCR. Results of the study show that the BTEX emissions were below detection limits for both diesel and natural gas vehicles, while carbonyl emissions were observed during cold start and low-temperature operations of the natural gas vehicles. Ammonia emissions of about 1 g/mile were observed from the stoichiometric natural gas vehicles equipped with TWC over all the driving cycles. The tailpipe GWP of the stoichiometric natural gas goods movement application was 7% lower than DPF and SCR equipped diesel. In the case of a refuse truck application the stoichiometric natural gas engine exhibited 22% lower GWP than a diesel vehicle. Tailpipe methane emissions contribute to less than 6% of the total GHG emissions. Implications: Modern heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines are equipped with multiple after-treatment systems and complex control strategies aimed at meeting both the performance standards for the end user and meeting stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions regulation. Compared to older technology diesel and natural gas engines, modern engines and after-treatment technology have reduced unregulated emissions to levels close to detection limits.

We also examine the opportunities that exist for increasing soil C sequestration using management practices such as reduced tillage, reduced frequency of summer fallowing, introduction of forage crops into crop rotations, conversion of cropland to grassland and nutrient addition via fertilization. In order to provide information on the impact of such management practices on the net GHG budget we ran simulations using CENTURY (a C model) and DNDC (a N model) for five locations across Canada, for a 30-yr time period. These simulations provide information on the potential trade-off between C sequestration and increased N2O emissions. Our model output suggests that conversion of cropland to grassland will result in the largest reduction in net GHG emissions, while nutrient additions via fertilizers will result in a small increase in GHG emissions.

Simple estimates of future changes in irrigation efficiency and water costs suggest that by 2080 mitigation may translate into annual cost reductions of about 10 billion US$.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "dd297fd03397cd87e8131a11d683180048fe3f64", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068331532", "DOI": "10.1243/0954407001527727", "CorpusId": 98364110}, "title": "In-cylinder studies of the effects of CO2 in exhaust gas recirculation on diesel combustion and emissions", "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports the results of the effects of CO2 in exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on diesel combustion and emissions. The experiments were carried out on a specially designed single-cylinder diesel engine. In-cylinder measurements were obtained from the optically accessible swirl chamber using high-speed shadowgraphy, the two-colour method and laser extinction. Furthermore, in-cylinder pressure measurements from the combustion chambers were used to derive the heat release rates during combustion. Two experiments were carried out on the effects of CO2 on diesel combustion and pollutant formation. In the first series of experiments, CO2 was used to replace some of the oxygen in the intake mixture, which simulated the dilution effect of conventional EGR. This so-called replacement EGR method was characterized by the typical NOx and smoke trade-off, where NOx reduction was accomplished at the expense of exhaust smoke. In the second series of tests, CO2 was added to the intake charge so that the oxygen concentration in the combustion chamber was not affected. In this additional EGR method, CO2 was found to suppress both NOx and smoke emissions. The mechanisms of these two different EGR modes on diesel combustion and emissions were examined using the above in-cylinder measurement techniques and exhaust emission analysis.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "5bf35db6e212999aa22e29ed3d22c28b07912760", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1967480270", "DOI": "10.1016/0004-6981(89)90015-2", "CorpusId": 93800918}, "title": "Non-linear response of wet deposition to emissions reduction: A model study", "abstract": null, "year": 1989}, {"paperId": "39af4e03048b4cf887fc8853e3b7f26cfa79cb5a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "189059078", "CorpusId": 128109511}, "title": "Compilation of a global inventory of emissions of nitrous oxide.", "abstract": "A global inventory with 1\u00b0x1\u00b0 resolution was compiled of emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to the atmosphere, including emissions from soils under natural vegetation, fertilized agricultural land, grasslands and animal excreta, biomass burning, forest clearing, oceans, fossil fuel and biofuel combustion, and industrial sources.A simple global model of the production potential of N 2 O in soils under natural vegetation was developed to analyze the relative importance of five major controls on N 2 O production: (i) input of organic matter, (ii) soil fertility, (iii) soil moisture status, (iv) temperature; and (v) soil oxygen status. Indices for the controls were derived from global gridded (1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0 resolution) data bases of soil type and texture, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climate. The model explains close to 60% of the variability found in measurements reported at about 30 sites in six different ecosystems throughout the world. The model results confirm conclusions from earlier studies that the major natural source regions of N 2 O are in the tropics.Literature data on N 2 O flux measurements from agricultural fields show that the fertilizerinduced N 2 O emission is higher for measurements covering longer periods than for measurements which represent short periods. A method to estimate the total annual direct N 2 O emission from fertilized fields was based on measurements covering periods of one year: N 2 O-N emission = I kg N ha -1 yr -1 plus 1.25 \u00b1 1% of the amount of fertilizer N applied (kg N ha -1 yr -1 ). This relationship was used to compile a global 1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0 resolution inventory of emissions of N 2 O from fertilized arable land.The inventory of N 2 O emission from animal excreta was based on estimates of nitrogen (N) excretion by various categories of domestic animals. The estimated global amount of N in animal excreta (-100 x 10 12 g N yr -1 ) suggests that the associated N 2 O emission may be of the same order of magnitude as that caused by the use of synthetic N fertilizer (-80 x 10 12 g N yr -1 )To illustrate the difficulty to describe the cycling of N in ecosystems, N budgets were compiled for a deforestation sequence in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. After forest clearing an important part of the soil organic N is mineralized. Part of the nitrate formed by nitrification of the mineralized N is lost via leaching, while most of the N loss occurs through denitrification. After a period of 3 to 5 years most of the easily decomposable material is lost, and denitrification and N 2 O fluxes decrease with time to levels lower than in the undisturbed forest. The global estimate of enhanced soil N 2 O emission from denitrification following tropical forest clearing, accounting for this decline of N 2 O fluxes along with ageing of the clearing, indicates that deforestation is an important global source.Global 10 x 1\u00b0 resolution inventories were also compiled for N 2 O emissions from fossil fuel and fuelwood combustion, and industrial N2O sources. For N 2 O emissions from oceans and biomass burning, inventories from the literature were used. The complete inventory of annual N 2 O emissions including all sources, was compared with source estimates inferred from inversemodeling. The N 2 O inventories are in general agreement with inverse modeling results. However, there are major uncertainties, particularly in the tropics. The comparison between the emission inventory and the source estimates from inverse modelling, resulted in improved understanding of some sources:- The oceanic N 2 O emission may be higher than previous estimates; the 0\u00b0N-30\u00b0N latitudinal zone and the Antarctic ocean show much higher N 2 O fluxes than the mean global oceanic flux.- Most of the N 2 O from arable lands and grasslands including effects of synthetic fertilizers and animal excreta comes from the northern hemisphere. Inputs of N to soils from N deposition and from N fixation by leguminous crops are of the same order of magnitude as synthetic N fertilizer use. Their associated N 2 O release may also be similar in magnitude.- Fossil-fuel combustion and industrial N 2 O sources are dominant in the 30\u00b0N-90\u00b0N zone, while N 2 O from fuelwood combustion is mainly produced in the 0\u00b0N-30\u00b0N zone.- The major part of the N 2 O emitted from coastal marine and fresh water systems probably stems from the northern hemisphere.Global monthly estimates of N 2 O emissions were used to prescribe a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model. The simulated northern hemispheric N 2 O surface concentration was -1 ppb higher than in the southern hemisphere. This is in general agreement with atmospheric observations. The modeled N 2 O concentrations over strong source regions in continental interiors were up to 5 ppb higher than those over oceans. Predicted concentrations for the northern hemisphere were somewhat higher in summer than in winter, in agreement with the seasonality of N 2 O emissions. However, the atmospheric N 2 O concentration measurements show no seasonal variation in the northern hemisphere. The small seasonality in modeled atmospheric N 2 O concentrations for the southern hemisphere is more consistent with measurements. Inconsistencies between predicted and observed atmospheric N 2 O concentrations may be caused by overestimation of the seasonality in the northern hemisphere. The global N 2 O inventory used does not account for soil N 2 O consumption in temperate N-limited ecosystems and observed episodic emissions in temperate ecosystems during winter, early spring and autumn. These potential errors and possible underestimation of N 2 O emissions from combustion in winter may exaggerate the simulated seasonal trends.Another possible reason for the inconsistencies found between predicted and measured N 2 O concentrations is that seasonal trends in atmospheric N 2 O concentrations remain unobserved, because of the remote location of most monitoring stations. In addition, the precision of N 2 O measurements is not adequate for resolving seasonal trends.The major part of the atmospheric N 2 O increase stems from sources related to human food production. A growing world population will inevitably lead to more food demand. Moreover, an increasing portion of the synthetic fertilizers is used to increase animal production. At present, close to 40% of the global cereal production and 25% of the production of root and tuber crops is fed to animals. An important global reduction of N 2 O emission associated with food production could be achieved by a shift-away from animal production, by more efficient agricultural use of N, and by advanced fertilization techniques.Solutions to reduce N 2 O emission from fossil fuel combustion include technical options (e.g. development of new catalysts) and energy saving. Several industrial and chemical processes generate N 2 O, but so far only the N 2 O production from nitric and adipic acid production have been quantified. The global N 2 O emission from adipic acid production is currently decreasing as the major producers have agreed to reduce N 2 O emissions.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "7ca91f954eb023b77cccacecb97884b92914abbd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1591271235", "CorpusId": 60637429}, "title": "An Analysis of the European Emission Trading Scheme", "abstract": "An international emissions trading system is a featured instrument in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases among major industrial countries. The US was the leading proponent of emissions trading in the negotiations leading up to the Protocol, with the European Union initially reluctant to embrace the idea. However the US withdrawal from the Protocol has greatly changed the nature of the agreement. One result is that the EU has moved rapidly ahead, establishing in 2003 the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) for the period of 2005-2007. This Scheme was intended as a test designed to help its member states transition to a system that would lead to compliance with their Kyoto Protocol commitments, which cover the period 20082012. The ETS covers CO2 emissions from big industrial entities in the electricity, heat, and energyintensive sectors. It is a system that itself is evolving as allocations, rules, and registries were still being finalized in some member states late into 2005, even though the system started in January of that year. We analyze the ETS using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We find that a competitive carbon market clears at a carbon price of about 0.6 to 0.9 /tCO2 (~2 to 3 /tC) for the 2005-2007 period in a base run of our model in line with many observers\u2019 expectations who saw the cuts required under the system as very mild, but in sharp contrast to the actual history of trading prices, which have settled in the range of 20 to 25 /tCO2 (~70 to 90 /tC) by the middle of 2005. In various comparison exercises the EPPA model\u2019s estimates of carbon prices have been similar to that of other models, and so the contrast between projection and reality in the ETS raises questions regarding the potential real cost of emissions reductions vis-a-vis expectations previously formed based on results from the modeling community.

The presence of cortical atrophy in conventional and scientific neuroimaging has been a matter of debate. In studies using computertomography, positron emission tomography, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and conventional T2-weighted and proton-weighted images, results have been variable. Recent morphometric studies by magnetic resonance imaging have produced conflicting results regarding the extent of grey and white matter involvement in ALS patients.MethodsThe authors used optimized voxel-based morphometry as an unbiased whole brain approach to detect differences between regional grey and white matter volumes. Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of ALS according to El-Escorial criteria and seventeen age-matched controls received a high resolution anatomical T1 scan.ResultsIn ALS patients regional grey matter volume (GMV) reductions were found in the pre- and postcentral gyrus bilaterally which extended to premotor, parietal and frontal regions bilaterally compared with controls (p < 0.05, corrected for the entire volume). The revised ALS functional rating scale showed a positive correlation with GMV reduction of the right medial frontal gyrus corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. No significant differences were found for white matter volumes or when grey and white matter density images were investigated. There were no further correlations with clinical variables found.ConclusionIn ALS patients, primary sensorimotor cortex atrophy can be regarded as a prominent feature of the disease. Supporting the concept of ALS being a multisytem disorder, our study provides further evidence for extramotor involvement which is widespread. The lack of correlation with common clinical variables probably reflects the fact that heterogeneous disease processes underlie ALS. The discrepancy within all published morphometric studies in ALS so far may be related to differences in patient cohorts and several methodological factors of the data analysis process. Longitudinal studies are required to further clarify the time course and distribution of grey and white matter pathology during the course of ALS.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "516625edb3a4a27b2222c4172355079bf20fa4fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1968942848", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2008.05.029", "CorpusId": 153701565}, "title": "Olympic Games promote the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in Beijing", "abstract": null, "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "9e08a3ad9849a4eceeb4548453409973b13f8712", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2795934815", "DOI": "10.1002/2015EF000336", "CorpusId": 130172935}, "title": "Uncertainty partition challenges the predictability of vital details of climate change", "abstract": "Decision makers and consultants are particularly interested in \u201cdetailed\u201d information on future climate to prepare adaptation strategies and adjust design criteria. Projections of future climate at local spatial scales and fine temporal resolutions are subject to the same uncertainties as those at the global scale but the partition among uncertainty sources (emission scenarios, climate models, and internal climate variability) remains largely unquantified. At the local scale, the uncertainty of the mean and extremes of precipitation is shown to be irreducible for mid and end\u2010of\u2010century projections because it is almost entirely caused by internal climate variability (stochasticity). Conversely, projected changes in mean air temperature and other meteorological variables can be largely constrained, even at local scales, if more accurate emission scenarios can be developed. The results were obtained by applying a comprehensive stochastic downscaling technique to climate model outputs for three exemplary locations. In contrast with earlier studies, the three sources of uncertainty are considered as dependent and, therefore, non\u2010additive.

The objective of this project was to build a mobile emissions measurement laboratory, of engine test cell quality, that is capable of measuring regulated and non-regulated emissions, and meets US EPA 2007 and 2010 specifications. A thirty-foot long cargo container was constructed to house a portable emissions measurement facility, comprised of a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) primary dilution unit, two primary full-flow dilution tunnels, a subsonic venturi, a secondary particulate matter sampling system, a gaseous emissions analytical bench instrumentation system, a computer based data acquisition (DAQ) and control system, full air conditioning and ventilation system, and chassis dynamometer control systems. Dual tunnels, of 18 inches ID and 20 feet long provide dedicated measurement capability for both lower PM vehicles, as well as legacy diesel fueled vehicles.

Brain perfusion images were obtained by single\u2010photon emission computed tomography. When affected by TL, PD patients showed marked improvement of gait parameters, mainly reduction of cadence. In regional cerebral blood flow analysis, when TL was compared with PL, both groups had common activation in the posterior parietal cortex and cerebellar hemispheres. Especially in the right lateral premotor cortex, PD patients showed enhanced activation induced by TL to a significantly greater degree than the controls. The present study indicates that the network dedicated to visuomotor control, particularly the lateral premotor cortex, plays an important role in the development of the paradoxical gait induced by special visual stimuli in PD patients.

For this technology to become feasible, highly selective and productive catalysts that can operate under a wide range of reaction conditions near thermodynamic conversion are required. Here we combine a CO-producing In oxide catalyst with a methane-producing Co catalyst to obtain an In/Co catalyst for CO2 reduction to methanol. Density functional (DFT) simulations demonstrate that the charge transfer between the Co support and the In oxide film leads to enrichment of the surface of indium oxide with O vacancies, which serve as active sites for selective conversion of CO2 to methanol. Moreover, our simulations suggest that CO2 reduction on Co-supported In2O3\u2013x films will preferentially yield methanol, rather than CO and methane. As a result, the prepared In@Co catalysts produce methanol from CO2 with high selectivity (>80%) and productivity ...", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "c473133009e9e1cbc2a57cb3f4c4417f7a3e6706", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2088002868", "DOI": "10.3141/2233-06", "CorpusId": 110480082}, "title": "Evaluation of Effectiveness of Coordinated Signal Control in Reducing Vehicle Emissions during Peak Hours versus Nonpeak Hours", "abstract": "Traffic signal coordination is not only an effective traffic flow operational strategy to smooth the traffic in urban areas but is also considered a potentially effective means to reduce vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, when traffic flow speed decreases, the effectiveness of using traffic signal coordination to reduce emissions may be substantially weakened. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of signal coordination in reducing vehicle emissions during peak versus nonpeak hours, two speed scenarios. The operating mode binning approach is used as a statistical technique to calculate emission rates, and the difference in emissions is adopted as the measure of effectiveness in the study. Data used in the study include Global Positioning System data and emission data collected from real-world tests. It was found from the study that coordinated signal control could reduce vehicle emissions in the following order (most to least reduction): oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. However, its effectiveness would be impaired during peak hours when the speed was decreased. Meanwhile, the test shows that the effectiveness will be affected by driver behavior. Either low average speed or intentionally slow driving will weaken the effectiveness of coordinated control in reducing vehicle emissions. The research in this paper is a pilot study and the same methodology will be used to conduct a more thorough study.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e8538ff323a0a524fc3377d9a9b39edcad0e13d7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2052289163", "ArXiv": "1010.0374", "DOI": "10.1007/s11207-010-9611-7", "CorpusId": 118738390}, "title": "Determining Absorption, Emissivity Reduction, and Local Suppression Coefficients inside Sunspots", "abstract": "The power of solar acoustic waves is reduced inside sunspots mainly due to absorption, emissivity reduction, and local suppression. The coefficients of these power-reduction mechanisms can be determined by comparing time\u2009\u2013\u2009distance cross-covariances obtained from sunspots and from the quiet Sun. By analyzing 47 active regions observed by SOHO/MDI without using signal filters, we have determined the coefficients of surface absorption, deep absorption, emissivity reduction, and local suppression. The dissipation in the quiet Sun is derived as well. All of the cross-covariances are width corrected to offset the effect of dispersion. We find that absorption is the dominant mechanism of the power deficit in sunspots for short travel distances, but gradually drops to zero at travel distances longer than about 6\u00b0. The absorption in sunspot interiors is also significant. The emissivity-reduction coefficient ranges from about 0.44 to 1.00 within the umbra and 0.29 to 0.72 in the sunspot, and accounts for only about 21.5% of the umbra\u2019s and 16.5% of the sunspot\u2019s total power reduction. Local suppression is nearly constant as a function of travel distance with values of 0.80 and 0.665 for umbrae and whole sunspots respectively, and is the major cause of the power deficit at large travel distances.", "year": 2010}]}
