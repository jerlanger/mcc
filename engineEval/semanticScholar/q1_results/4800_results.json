China's anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric mercury (Hg) are effectively constrained by national air pollution control and energy efficiency policies. In this study, improved methods, based on available data from domestic field measurements, are developed to quantify the benefits of Hg abatement by various emission control measures. Those measures include increased use of (1) flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in power generation; (2) precalciner kilns with fabric filters (FF) in cement production; (3) mechanized coking ovens with electrostatic precipitators (ESP) in iron and steel production; and (4) advanced production technologies in nonferrous metal smelting. Investigation reveals declining trends in emission factors for each of these sources, which together drive a much slower growth of total Hg emissions than the growth of China's energy consumption and economy, from 679 metric tons (t) in 2005 to 750 t in 2012. In particular, estimated emissions from the above-mentioned four source types declined 3% from 2005 to 2012, which can be attributed to expanded deployment of technologies with higher energy efficiencies and air pollutant removal rates. Emissions from other anthropogenic sources are estimated to increase by 22% during the period. The species shares of total Hg emissions have been stable in recent years, with mass fractions of around 55, 39, and 6% for gaseous elemental Hg (Hg0), reactive gaseous mercury (Hg2+), and particle-bound mercury (Hgp), respectively. The higher estimate of total Hg emissions than previous inventories is supported by limited simulation of atmospheric chemistry and transport. With improved implementation of emission controls and energy saving, a 23% reduction in annual Hg emissions from 2012 to 2030, to below 600 t, is expected at the most. While growth in Hg emissions has been gradually constrained, uncertainties quantified by Monte Carlo simulation for recent years have increased, particularly for the power sector and particular industrial sources. The uncertainty (expressed as 95% confidence intervals) of Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants, for example, increased from \u221248\u2013+73% in 2005 to \u221250\u2013+89% in 2012. This is attributed mainly to increased penetration of advanced manufacturing and pollutant control technologies; the unclear operational status and relatively small sample sizes of field measurements of those processes have resulted in lower but highly varied emission factors. To reduce uncertainty and further confirm the benefits of pollution control and energy polices, therefore, systematic investigation of specific Hg pollution sources is recommended. The variability of temporal trends and spatial distributions of Hg emissions needs to be better tracked during the ongoing dramatic changes in China's economy, energy use, and air pollution status.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "38ece75ffffdfa8cdcde63f13fa918b8e44a401c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1909989996", "DOI": "10.4271/2009-01-1503", "CorpusId": 109707538}, "title": "Development of a Turbocharged Direct Injection Downsizing Demonstrator Engine", "abstract": "This paper describes the initial development of a 3 cylinder 1.2l technology demonstrator engine from MAHLE.

To evaluate the mitigation of net GWP (CH4\u2009+\u2009N2O) from double rice (Oryza Sativa Indica) cultivation by adjusting the time to start MSA, a two-year (2009\u2009\u223c\u20092010) field experiment was conducted in Yingtan, Jiangxi Province, China.

In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on developments in the past decade, concentrating on the winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the winds from Luminous Blue Variables (including super-Eddington, continuum-driven winds), winds from Wolf\u2013Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After recapitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven winds, extensions accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. Stationary wind models are presented that provide theoretical predictions for the mass-loss rates as a function of spectral type, metallicity, and the proximity to the Eddington limit. The relevance of the so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results from corresponding campaigns (including the VLT-flames survey of massive stars) with theoretical predictions, featuring the mass loss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently, we concentrate on two urgent problems, weak winds and wind-clumping, that have been identified from various diagnostics and that challenge our present understanding of radiation driven winds. We discuss the problems of \u201cmeasuring\u201d mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the NIR Br\u03b1-line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and comment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than predicted by the standard model. Wind-clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong instability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the interpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are usually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses. Depending on the specific diagnostics, such overestimates can amount to factors of 2 to 10, and we describe ongoing attempts to allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present-day mass-loss rates. We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars. Such emission is thought to originate both from magnetically confined winds and from non-magnetic winds, in the latter case related to the line-driven instability and/or clump-clump collisions. We highlight as to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues regarding an adequate description of wind clumping.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "2eefae3516f4ab0a614bc45e8655d26310e9b35a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977569507", "DOI": "10.3390/EN5083074", "CorpusId": 14937640}, "title": "Assessment of Thailand\u2019s Energy Policies and CO 2 Emissions: Analyses of Energy Efficiency Measures and Renewable Power Generation", "abstract": "This study assesses Thailand\u2019s energy policies on renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency in industries and buildings.

We characterized the sensitivity of these clouds to regional drought, and we investigated their effects on climate by using an atmospheric general circulation model. Satellite observations during 2000\u20132006 indicated that El Nino-induced regional drought led to increases in fire emissions and, consequently, increases in aerosol optical depths over Sumatra, Borneo and the surrounding ocean. Next, we used the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) to investigate how climate responded to this forcing. We conducted two 30 year simulations in which monthly fire emissions were prescribed for either a high (El Nino, 1997) or low (La Nina, 2000) fire year using a satellite-derived time series of fire emissions. Our simulations included the direct and semi-direct effects of aerosols on the radiation budget within the model.

To this end, we analysed the impact of four emissions scenarios on future renewable groundwater resources, which range from 1600 GtCO2 during the 21st century (RCP2.6) to 7300 GtCO2 (RCP8.5). Climate modelling uncertainty was taken into account by applying the bias-corrected output of a small ensemble of five CMIP5 global climate models (GCM) as provided by the ISI-MIP effort to the global hydrological model WaterGAP. Despite significant climate model uncertainty, the benefits of avoided emissions with respect to renewable groundwater resources (i.e. groundwater recharge (GWR)) are obvious. The percentage of projected global population (SSP2 population scenario) suffering from a significant decrease of GWR of more than 10% by the 2080s as compared to 1971\u20132000 decreases from 38% (GCM range 27\u201350%) for RCP8.5 to 24% (11\u201339%) for RCP2.6.

We report, for the first time, estimates of such livestock emissions intensities for all regions of the world and decompose the intensities to understand the sources of regional variation. Our findings indicate that most of the variation is due to differences in the value of output per animal in different regions, which in turn is due to regional differences in output per animal (yield) and dollar per unit output (price). Animals with relatively low annual output values tend to be characterized by higher economic emissions intensities. We find this to be the case in many developing countries.

The downside of these well-intended efforts has been a lowering of air exchange rates, such that many chemical contaminants are trapped indoors where people spend most of their lives. These contaminants may include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, that have been suggested by some to be among the factors responsible for this air quality deterioration. Wood composite panels such as particleboard and medium density fiberboard (MDF) are often targeted for strict emission regulations or prohibited altogether despite the fact that industry has reduced formaldehyde emissions of raw panels by more than 80 percent over the past 20 years to minimize indoor-air contaminants. Moreover, most consumer products made with composite panels are not used in a raw form, but instead have some type of surface finish over the substrate that generally acts as a barrier to off-gassing, thereby reducing emissions. In this 2003 research, 10 commonly used finishes were evaluated for their effectiveness as emissions barriers for formaldehyde and total VOC (TVOC). Three different MDF and four unfinished particleboard products from different manufacturers were analyzed and compared to their corresponding finished products. Formaldehyde and VOC measurements were conducted according to ASTM D 6007-96 and ASTM D 5116-97, respectively. For the finishes and coatings, results indicated that the epoxy powder coatings used to finish the MDF samples performed the best, achieving 99+ percent emission reduction in formaldehyde and up to 94 percent reduction of TVOC emissions (noted as 99+%/94%). This compared to reductions of 89%/85% for the UV paint and 11%/(27% increase) for the acrylic painted topcoat on MDF. A multiple (3) topcoat wet process treatment showed a 28 percent reduction in formaldehyde emissions but an increase in TVOC emissions. The respective formaldehyde/TVOC emission reductions for the laminates were 99%/88% for phenolic paper laminates, 99%/66% for vinyl, 93%/85% for the 80-g melamine paper, and 73%/75% for the 60-g foil on particleboard. These very limited data suggest that several of the treatments are very efficient formaldehyde and TVOC emission barriers when applied to particleboard and MDF, although epoxy powders are typically applied only to MDF.

The proposed reduction in emissions of nitrogenous pollutants in Europe under the Gothenburg Protocol raises the question of whether affected ecosystems have the potential to recover to their previous condition and, if so, over what timescale. Since 1998, we have monitored the response of a lowland heathland in southern England following the cessation of a long\u2010term nitrogen addition experiment, and subsequent management, assessing changes in vegetation growth and chemistry, soil chemistry and the soil microbial community. Persistent effects of earlier nutrient loading on Calluna growth and phenology, and on the abundance of lichens, were apparent up to 8 years after nitrogen additions ceased, indicating the potential for long\u2010term effects of modest nutrient loading (up to 15.4\u2003kg\u2003N\u2003ha\u22121\u2003yr\u22121, over 7 years) on heathland ecosystems.

Although habitat management in 1998 reduced nitrogen stores in plant biomass, effects on belowground nitrogen stores were small. Although some parameters (e.g. soil pH) recover pretreatment levels relatively rapidly, others (e.g. vegetation cover and microbial activity) respond much more slowly, indicating that the ecological effects of even small increases in nitrogen deposition will persist for many years after deposition inputs are reduced. Indeed, calculations suggest that the additional soil nitrogen storage associated with 7 years of experimental nitrogen inputs could sustain the observed effects on plant growth and phenology for several decades.

Some of these GHGs (e.g., methane) have atmospheric lifetimes of decades or less, whereas others (e.g., carbon dioxide) persist for centuries to millennia. As policy seeks to reduce climate changes, it is important to understand how mitigation of different gases each contributes to this goal. Our study shows that short-lived GHGs contribute to thermal expansion of the ocean over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. Actions taken to reduce emissions of short-lived gases could mitigate centuries of additional future sea-level rise. Mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases with short lifetimes (order of a year to decades) can contribute to limiting warming, but less attention has been paid to their impacts on longer-term sea-level rise. We show that short-lived greenhouse gases contribute to sea-level rise through thermal expansion (TSLR) over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. For example, at least half of the TSLR due to increases in methane is expected to remain present for more than 200 y, even if anthropogenic emissions cease altogether, despite the 10-y atmospheric lifetime of this gas. Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have already been phased out under the Montreal Protocol due to concerns about ozone depletion and provide an illustration of how emission reductions avoid multiple centuries of future TSLR. We examine the \u201cworld avoided\u201d by the Montreal Protocol by showing that if these gases had instead been eliminated in 2050, additional TSLR of up to about 14 cm would be expected in the 21st century, with continuing contributions lasting more than 500 y. Emissions of the hydrofluorocarbon substitutes in the next half-century would also contribute to centuries of future TSLR. Consideration of the time scales of reversibility of TSLR due to short-lived substances provides insights into physical processes: sea-level rise is often assumed to follow air temperature, but this assumption holds only for TSLR when temperatures are increasing.

Observations and models demonstrate that ozone and its precursors can be transported between continents and across oceans. We model the influences of 10% reductions in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions from each of nine world regions on surface ozone air quality in that region and all other regions. In doing so, we quantify the relative importance of long-range transport between all source-receptor pairs, for direct short-term ozone changes. We find that for population-weighted concentrations during the three-month \"ozone-season\", the strongest inter-regional influences are from Europe to the Former Soviet Union, East Asia to Southeast Asia, and Europe to Africa. The largest influences per unit of NO x reduced, however, are seen for source regions in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, which we attribute mainly to greater sensitivity to changes in NO x in the lower troposphere, and secondarily to increased vertical convection to the free troposphere in tropical regions, allowing pollutants to be transported further. Results show, for example, that NO x reductions in North America are ~20% as effective per unit NO x in reducing ozone in Europe during summer, as NO x reductions from Europe itself. Reducing anthropogenic emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) by 10% in selected regions, can have as large an impact on long-range ozone transport as NO x reductions, depending on the source region. We find that for many source-receptor pairs, the season of greatest long-range influence does not coincide with the season when ozone is highest in the receptor region. Reducing NO x emissions in most source regions causes a larger decrease in export of ozone from the source region than in ozone production outside of the source region.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ddcf95ca95ab524762aef9f380cc172bb9f62d4e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2958993402", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01707", "CorpusId": 197421804, "PubMed": "31313568"}, "title": "Spinel LiMn2O4 Nanofiber: An Efficient Electrocatalyst for N2 Reduction to NH3 under Ambient Conditions.", "abstract": "The production of ammonia (NH3) in the industrial scale basically relies on the traditional technology of Haber-Bosch, which is operated under harsh conditions with high energy consumption and a huge number of greenhouse gas emissions.

The third scenario represents a hypothetical rendering of what NOx emissions would have been in 2002 if no emission controls had been imposed on the utility sector. Examination of the modeled median and 95th percentile daily maximum 8-hr average ozone concentrations reveals that median ozone levels estimated for the 2004 emission scenario were less than those modeled for 2002 in the region most affected by the NOx SIP Call. Comparison of the \u201cno-control\u201d with the \u201c2002\u201d scenario revealed that ozone concentrations would have been much higher in much of the eastern United States if the utility sector had not implemented NOx emission controls; exceptions occurred in the immediate vicinity of major point sources where increased NO titration tends to lower ozone levels.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "5ddb21425923aa6ee062d9a5493d4c204cf257bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2115462734", "DOI": "10.3141/2189-11", "CorpusId": 110332385}, "title": "Energy and Emission Benefit Comparison of Stationary and In-Vehicle Advanced Driving Alert Systems", "abstract": "Automobiles powered by fossil fuels are one of the major contributors to both criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas\u2014in particular, carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014emissions. Previous studies revealed that unnecessary acceleration and hard braking in response to sudden changes of traffic signals may cause a significant amount of wasted energy and increased emissions. Altering the behavior of drivers approaching signalized intersections potentially could reduce energy consumption and emissions from motor vehicles without increasing travel time or delay. Two types of advanced driving alert systems (ADAS) are proposed: stationary ADAS [based on roadside infrastructure, such as changeable message signs (CMSs)] and in-vehicle ADAS [driven by advanced communication technology, such as vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII)]. These systems can help drivers avoid hard braking at intersections by providing real-time information on traffic signal status. A state-of-the-art modal emissions model is used to evaluate and compare the effects of these two types of ADAS on the reduction of vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. A numerical analysis of a single vehicle shows that ADAS can help reduce vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 40% in the tested hypothetical conditions. The benefits of these systems are further investigated in a traffic simulation environment with various levels of congestion and posted speed limits. The simulation results reveal that both CMS-based ADAS and VII-driven ADAS can provide fuel and CO2 savings; VII ADAS offer greater savings in most cases.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "afec9b10f9fee0dc62f2fc284ea2298cfa9e4fd1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129387883", "DOI": "10.1504/IJETP.2004.004588", "CorpusId": 85525509}, "title": "Emission trading and the role of learning-by-doing spillovers in the \"bottom-up\" energy-system ERIS model", "abstract": "In this paper, using the \"bottom-up\" energy-system optimisation ERIS model, we examine the effects of emission trading on technology deployment, emphasising the role of technology learning spillovers.

In this study, I used an intermediate complexity coupled climate-carbon model to quantify allowable CO 2 emissions for a series of scenarios leading to CO 2 stabilization at levels between 350 and 1000 ppmv. For all scenarios, global temperature did not stabilize over the next several centuries, but rather continued to increase well beyond the point of CO 2 stabilization. Furthermore, neither long-term climate change, nor total allowable CO 2 emissions, were sensitive to the shape of the CO 2 stabilization profile, but only to the final stabilization level. For the 550-stabilization scenario, positive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks required a reduction of annual CO 2 emissions throughout the simulation, with a maximum reduction of 2.3 GtC/yr occurring at 2050. Total emissions over the 21st century were 20% lower than those derived from an equivalent simulation without feedbacks. In two additional runs with varied climate sensitivities, emissions consistent with 550-stabilization were reduced by between 190 and 540 GtC over the next 400 yr relative to the no-feedbacks run. Allowable emissions were further reduced in all cases if CO 2 increases did not affect future vegetation productivity, as this removed an otherwise important negative feedback on atmospheric CO 2 .

Here we assess the magnitude of the threat that US non-cooperation poses to the Paris Agreement from an international relations perspective. We argue that US non-cooperation does not fundamentally alter US emissions, which are unlikely to rise even in the absence of new federal climate policies. Nor does it undermine nationally determined contributions under pledge and review, as the Paris Agreement has introduced a new logic of domestically driven climate policies and the cost of low-carbon technologies keeps falling. However, US non-participation in raising climate finance could raise high barriers to global climate cooperation in the future. Political strategies to mitigate these threats include direct engagement by climate leaders such as the European Union with key emerging economies, notably China and India, and domestic climate policies that furnish benefits to traditional opponents of ambitious climate policy. Key policy insights US non-cooperation need not be a major threat to pledge and review under the Paris Agreement. US non-cooperation is a serious threat to climate finance.

The closest to a comprehensive review on this topic is a book of symposium proceedings edited by Kiene et al. (75); the more recent developments related specifically to DMSP degradation by microbial communities are found elsewhere (68). This article is more comprehensive, as it includes some of the earlier literature in describing the sources of DMSP, its release and linkage to the marine (primarily microbial) food web and subsequent degradation via cleavage to DMS and acrylic acid or demethylation and demethiolation to methanethiol. \n \n \nDMS production from DMSP has long been associated with marine algae according to the following reaction (20, 22): \n \n \n \n \n(1) \n \n \n \nDMSP is a tertiary sulfonium compound produced in high concentration by certain species of marine algae and plant halophytes for the regulation of their internal osmotic environment (1, 41, 47, 120), although its role in plants remains unclear. This alga-associated, i.e., particulate DMSP (DMSPp), when released into the marine environment as dissolved DMSP (DMSPd), can serve as a link between primary production and the microbial population, as it is readily degraded by chemoheterotrophic bacteria (59). DMSP turnover usually exceeds DMS production in natural waters (60) because DMSP is also demethylated to 3-methiolpropionate, which can be further demethylated to 3-mercaptopropionate or demethiolated, releasing methanethiol (72, 118). These reactions will be discussed in more detail below. \n \nThe biogeochemical significance of DMSP cleavage was first suggested in 1972, when DMS was found to be universally present in seawater and emitted at a significant rate to the atmosphere (87). It was proposed that DMS, rather than H2S from coastal waters and mud flats, was the missing gaseous sulfur compound needed to enable the steady-state flow of sulfur between marine and terrestrial environments, making DMS emissions a key step in the global sulfur cycle (87). Atmospheric H2S, which arises primarily from dissimilatory sulfate reduction in organic matter-rich environments, could never be measured in sufficient quantity to be the vehicle for transferring large quantities of sulfur from sea to air to land. The total annual flux of biogenic DMS released to the atmosphere ranges from 28 to 45 Tg of S year\u22121, at least 10-fold higher than from all other sources (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Recent, more comprehensive calculations of global annual DMS flux from the oceans gave values that ranged from 13 to 37 Tg of S year\u22121 (57). This sea-to-air flux represents about 50% of the global biogenic sulfur flux to the atmosphere (3). However, anthropogenic sulfur emissions dominate the sulfur flux, representing 80 to 90% of the input to the global sulfur cycle (12, 23, 88). \n \n \n \nTABLE 1. \n \nEstimates of natural emissions of organosulfur compoundsa \n \n \n \nThe magnitude of the marine DMS emissions is all the more remarkable considering that over half of the DMSP released is demethylated (68) and that a significant fraction of the DMS is oxidized by bacteria in the water column before it can be released to the atmosphere (13, 64). While most of the biogenic sulfur emissions (primarily DMS) come from the oceans, those coming from salt marshes and coastal wetlands are many times higher on a unit area basis (112). DMS flux per unit area from these marine wetlands is also much higher than from any known terrestrial soil (2).

The reactions of interest include the gas-phase oxidation of Hg(0) by O3, the gas-phase oxidation of Hg(0) by OH, the aqueous-phase reduction of Hg(II) by HO2 radicals, a hypothetical gas-phase reduction of Hg(II) by SO2, and a hypothetical pseudo-first-order gas-phase reduction of Hg(II). The new kinetics of the oxidation of Hg(0) by O3 is fast and would require balancing by a commensurate reduction reaction pathway that has not been identified; it may include some heterogeneous component and should be seen as an upper limit for atmospheric applications. Eliminating the gas-phase oxidation of Hg(0) by both O3 and OH does not lead to realistic Hg(0) concentrations even after eliminating the aqueous-phase reduction of Hg(II) by HO2 and having a greater dry deposition rate of Hg(0). Thus gas-phase oxidation of Hg(0) by oxidants such as O3 and/or OH is required to reproduce global Hg(0) concentration patterns. The reduction of Hg(II) by HO2 (or a reaction with a similar overall rate) is needed to balance the oxidation of Hg(0) by OH and O3 but is not needed if the gas-phase oxidation of Hg(0) by OH is eliminated. The reduction of Hg(II) in power plant plumes can be represented by a reaction of Hg(II) with SO2; such a reaction is consistent with the global cycling of Hg.

Reduced resting global cerebral blood flow has been previously detected in association with heart failure (HF), but it is not clear whether there are brain regions that could be specifically affected by those brain perfusion deficits. The authors used a fully automated, voxel\u2010based image analysis method to investigate, across the entire cerebral volume, the presence of resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities in HF patients compared to healthy controls. Methods. rCBF was evaluated with 99m Tc\u2010single\u2010photon emission computed tomography in 17 HF patients (New York Heart Association functional class II or III) and 18 elderly healthy volunteers. Voxel\u2010based analyses of rCBF data were conducted using the statistical parametric mapping software. Results. Significant rCBF reductions in HF patients relative to controls (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons) were detected in 2 foci, encompassing, respectively, the left and right precuneus and cuneus and the right lateral temporoparietal cortex and posterior cingulated gyrus. In the HF group, there was also a significant direct correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment as assessed using the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination and rCBF on a voxel cluster involving the right posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, located closely to the site where between\u2010group rCBF differences had been identified.

This molecular imaging technique offers a complementary approach to anatomic imaging that is more sensitive and specific in certain cancers. FDG-PET has been widely applied in oncology primarily as a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care. However, because it accurately detects recurrent or residual disease, FDG-PET also has significant potential for assessing therapy response. In this regard, it can improve patient management by identifying responders early, before tumor size is reduced; nonresponders could discontinue futile therapy. Moreover, a reduction in the FDG-PET signal within days or weeks of initiating therapy (e.g., in lymphoma, non\u2013small cell lung, and esophageal cancer) significantly correlates with prolonged survival and other clinical end points now used in drug approvals. These findings suggest that FDG-PET could facilitate drug development as an early surrogate of clinical benefit. This article reviews the scientific basis of FDG-PET and its development and application as a valuable oncology imaging tool. Its potential to facilitate drug development in seven oncologic settings (lung, lymphoma, breast, prostate, sarcoma, colorectal, and ovary) is addressed. Recommendations include initial validation against approved therapies, retrospective analyses to define the magnitude of change indicative of response, further prospective validation as a surrogate of clinical benefit, and application as a phase II/III trial end point to accelerate evaluation and approval of novel regimens and therapies.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "1d6315c6c74f782b44562d7f36ed093ff96fd608", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2139948982", "DOI": "10.1002/bit.23074", "CorpusId": 25643022, "PubMed": "21328320"}, "title": "A limited LCA of bio\u2010adipic acid: Manufacturing the nylon\u20106,6 precursor adipic acid using the benzoic acid degradation pathway from different feedstocks", "abstract": "A limited life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on a combined biological and chemical process for the production of adipic acid, which was compared to the traditional petrochemical process.

Apart from the impact of usage of petrochemical and biomass\u2010based feedstocks, the environmental impact of the final concentration of cis, cis\u2010muconic acid in the fermentation broth was studied using 1.85% and 4.26% cis, cis\u2010muconic acid. The LCA focused on the cumulative energy demand (CED), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and the CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emission, with CO2 and N2O measured separately. The highest calculated reduction potential of CED and CExD were achieved using phenol, which reduced the CED by 29% and 57% with 1.85% and 4.26% cis, cis\u2010muconic acid, respectively. A decrease in the CO2eq emission was especially achieved when the N2O emission in the combined biological and chemical process was restricted.

This methodology enables us to visualise the efficiency-equity trade off which was made by the EU negotiators. We present simulations based on marginal carbon emission abatement cost curves estimated on data generated by the GEM-E3 Europe general equilibrium model. Our simulations reveal that the EU Burden Sharing Agreement improves in terms of cost efficiency upon a uniform reduction assignment but that substantial differences in marginal costs persist. Some poorer EU member states like Portugal and Spain have been allowed by the agreement to increase their emissions considerably but, even if we do not care about distributional justice, their allowances are too low according to the inverse optimum approach. Also Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium should abate less in order to improve cost efficiency. On the other hand, Germany, the UK, France and Denmark should curb their emissions by more than what has been assigned to them in the EU Burden Sharing Agreement. We show that introducing a measure of inequality aversion reinforces most of these conclusions. We also apply the inverse optimum approach to a scenario in which we allow for emission trading, possibly with market power.

Quantitative data such as diet chemical composition, rumen fermentation and microbial parameters, and qualitative information such as methane mitigation strategies were also collected. In the database, 31% of the experiments reported a concomitant reduction of both protozoa concentration and methane emission (g/kg dry matter intake).

Fine and qUF samples of traffic locations, characterized by a high concentration of elemental and organic carbon, induced the highest pro-inflammatory activity. The pro-inflammatory response to coarse samples was associated with the endotoxin level, which was found to increase dramatically during a three-day sample concentration procedure in the laboratory.

Augmenting the 2002 NEI with this additional information would bring its reported annual emissions to 8213 Mg/year, which is within a factor of 2 of the estimates herein.

The gene is still unidentified and hence the importance of PARK6 as a cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown. To date, no pathology or functional imaging studies are available on PARK6\u2010linked parkinsonism. We have used 18F\u2010dopa positron emission tomography to study four patients who are homozygous and three asymptomatic relatives who are heterozygous for PARK6. The clinically affected PARK6 subjects had a similar 85% reduction in posterior dorsal putamen 18F\u2010dopa uptake to a group of idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients matched for clinical disease severity and duration but showed significantly greater involvement of head of caudate and anterior putamen. The group of asymptomatic PARK6 carriers showed a significant mean 20 to 30% reduction in caudate and putamen 18F\u2010dopa uptake in comparison with controls, individual values falling toward the bottom of the normal range. Our results indicate that PARK6 pathology results in a more uniform loss of striatal dopamine terminal function than Parkinson's disease.

We introduce this aspect and show that, if we decide to delay emissions reductions, and the environmental effectiveness of global mitigation efforts is to remain the same in terms of temperature change, we must be willing and able to undertake much more substantial emission reductions than with early action. Even under conservative assumptions on initial political feasibility (maximum 0.25% year-on-year reductions), a 20-year delay means that we must reduce emissions at an annual rate that is 5 to 11 times greater than with early climate action. Our capacity for technological progress, political change and the inertia of the socio-economic system gives us reason to be concerned about our ability to achieve such higher rates of emission reductions. If we are not able to achieve such higher rates, delaying action will inevitably result in higher temperatures in 2100. Unless we are willing to accept higher temperatures, choosing to delay climate action is a gamble that political feasibility will increase over time as a result of the delay itself.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "2966467e1ffc1c2d23fb5ea295686ef749ac9861", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1506438503", "DOI": "10.1787/224074334782", "CorpusId": 152585319}, "title": "The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation", "abstract": "This paper examines the cost of a range of national, regional and global mitigation policies and the\ncorresponding incentives for countries to participate in ambitious international mitigation actions.

International communities have agreed in recent Paris agreement to reduce global pollution to certain level and have shown great concern with Chinese pollution.

This paper adds in this debate by exploring cointegration and causal relation between real GDP per capita, CO2 emissions per capita, energy consumption per capita and urban population for China utilizing annual data for the period of 1971\u20132014. Autoregressive distributed lag model has been used to confirm the cointegration among variables. Results reveal short run income coefficient is positive while it turns to negative and insignificant in long run marking that growth and development is supportive in CO2 emissions reduction in China. Its insignificancy gives impression that only growth dependency to overcome CO2 emissions will not be appropriate choice for China. By introducing income cubic function, N-shape relation between income and CO2 emissions was found in long run that re-emphasis though income is helping in emissions reduction, however, there is need to dependent on multiple environmental policies. Further, results show that energy consumption has positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions and energy coefficient was becoming fatter with the time. Urban population was insignificant while it turns to negative and significant with income cubic model suggesting that urbanization process is not adding to pollution emissions in China. Overall, results give feelings that model with income cubic function is suited well for Chinese economy. FMOLS and GMM estimators confirm ARDL results are robust.

Use of all-electric drive-trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle\u2019s limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switchingstation-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switchingstation systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, on account of statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and with advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions while battery-price reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "2cb8353cfb5e70d0505d0009fb8794ced1ba1c70", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2022541302", "DOI": "10.5194/HESS-7-609-2003", "CorpusId": 129503689}, "title": "Assessing emission reduction targets with dynamic models: deriving target load functions for use in integrated assessment", "abstract": "Abstract. International agreements to reduce the emission of acidifying sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds have been negotiated on the basis of an understanding of the link between acidification related changes in soil and surface water chemistry and terrestrial and aquatic biota. The quantification of this link is incorporated within the concept of critical loads. Critical loads are calculated using steady state models and give no indication of the time within which acidified ecosystems might be expected to recover. Dynamic models provide an opportunity to assess the timescale of recovery and can go further to provide outputs which can be used in future emission reduction strategies. In this respect, the Target Load Function (TLF) is proposed as a means of assessing the deposition load necessary to restore a damaged ecosystem to some pre-defined acceptable state by a certain time in the future. A target load represents the deposition of S and N in a defined year (implementation year) for which the critical limit is achieved in a defined time (target year). A TLF is constructed using an appropriate dynamic model to determine the value of a chemical criterion at a given point in time given a temporal pattern of S and N deposition loads. A TLF requires information regarding: (i) the chemical criterion required to protect the chosen biological receptor (i.e. the critical limit); (ii) the year in which the critical limit is required to be achieved; and (iii) time pattern of future emission reductions. In addition, the TLF can be assessed for whole regions to incorporate the effect of these three essentially ecosystem management decisions.

Recent work on the Mo-nitrogenase has revealed that reductive elimination of two bridging Fe-H-Fe hydrides on the active site FeMo-cofactor to yield H2 is a key feature in the N2 reduction mechanism. The N2 reduction mechanism for the Fe-nitrogenase active site FeFe-cofactor was unknown. Here, we have purified both component proteins of the Fe-nitrogenase system, the electron-delivery Fe protein (AnfH) plus the catalytic FeFe protein (AnfDGK), and established its mechanism of N2 reduction. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry show that the FeFe protein component does not contain significant amounts of Mo or V, thus ruling out a requirement of these metals for N2 reduction. The fully functioning Fe-nitrogenase system was found to have specific activities for N2 reduction (1 atm) of 181 \u00b1 5 nmol NH3 min-1 mg-1 FeFe protein, for proton reduction (in the absence of N2) of 1085 \u00b1 41 nmol H2 min-1 mg-1 FeFe protein, and for acetylene reduction (0.3 atm) of 306 \u00b1 3 nmol C2H4 min-1 mg-1 FeFe protein. Under turnover conditions, N2 reduction is inhibited by H2 and the enzyme catalyzes the formation of HD when presented with N2 and D2. These observations are explained by the accumulation of four reducing equivalents as two metal-bound hydrides and two protons at the FeFe-cofactor, with activation for N2 reduction occurring by reductive elimination of H2.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "8de9cddb4374253e914f0d31c2030c5afc840d58", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976350573", "DOI": "10.1049/EL:19870711", "CorpusId": 108889348}, "title": "Linewidth reduction by coupled phase-shift distributed-feedback lasers", "abstract": "A coupled phase-shift distributed-feedback structure is proposed to achieve narrow-linewidth laser emission.

The choice of foods to replace meat, however, was crucial, with some isocaloric substitutions possibly increasing total diet greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, nutritional adequacy was rarely or only partially assessed, thereby compromising the assessment of diet sustainability. Furthermore, high nutritional quality was not necessarily associated with affordability or lower environmental impact. Hence, when identifying sustainable diets, each dimension needs to be assessed by relevant indicators. Finally, some nonvegetarian self-selected diets consumed by a substantial fraction of the population showed good compatibility with the nutritional, environmental, affordability, and acceptability dimensions.
