Many countries are working hard to find measures, and industrial restructuring is considered to be an effective way to achieve economic development and emission reduction. However, previous studies have assumed that industrial restructuring and economic growth and emissions are simple linear relationships while neglecting nonlinear relationships. We use panel data from 32 countries from 1997 to 2017 and employ panel threshold models (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model and Solow growth model) for empirical test. The results reveal that industrial restructuring has statistically significant nonlinear effects on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions. With the process of industrialization and urbanization, industrial restructuring has a long-term positive impact on economic growth. The relationship among industrial restructuring and carbon dioxide emissions has been found to be inverted U\u2013shaped. Industrial restructuring is beneficial to reducing emissions. The policy implies that although industrial restructuring is considered to be an effective measure to achieve green growth, for countries with different degrees of urbanization and economic development, industrial structure transformation should adopt different policies.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "cea4249b62133425321e1ab69dc0081f6e3fa71a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2099230402", "DOI": "10.1007/s00249-003-0361-4", "CorpusId": 20418490, "PubMed": "14574524"}, "title": "Fluorescence spectroscopic detection of mitochondrial flavoprotein redox oscillations and transient reduction of the NADPH oxidase-associated flavoprotein in leukocytes", "abstract": "Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy of leukocyte flavoproteins have been performed. Both living human peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils have been utilized as experimental models, as the former relies much more heavily on mitochondrial metabolism for energy production than the latter. We confirm previous studies indicating that cellular flavoproteins absorb at 460\u00a0nm and emit at 530\u00a0nm, very similar to that of the FAD moiety. Furthermore, the emission properties of intracellular flavoproteins were altered by the metabolic inhibitors rotenone, antimycin A, azide, cyanide, DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol), and FCCP [carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone]. Kinetic studies revealed flavoprotein emission oscillations in both monocytes and neutrophils. The flavoprotein intensity oscillations correlated with the physiological status of the cell and the nature of membrane receptor ligation. Microscopy revealed the presence of flavoprotein fluorescence in association with the plasma membrane, intracellular granules and distributed throughout the cytoplasm, presumably within mitochondria. Metabolic inhibitors such as cyanide suggest that the plasma membrane and granular components are cyanide-insensitive and therefore are likely associated with the flavoprotein component of the NADPH oxidase, which is located in these two compartments. This interpretation was found to be consistent with structural localization of the NADPH oxidase using an antibody molecule specific for this protein. Using peripheral blood neutrophils, which display less active mitochondria, and time-resolved emission spectroscopy, we show that the NADPH oxidase-associated flavoprotein undergoes a periodic transient reduction of about 54\u00b12\u00a0ms in living cells. This finding is consistent with prior studies indicating that propagating substrate (NADPH) waves periodically promote electron transport across the NADPH oxidase.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "d25191a203ca6dc69cd7213a4a0ea76a67639e55", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2180290573", "DOI": "10.1115/92-GT-108", "CorpusId": 98193269}, "title": "Modification of Combustor Stoichiometry Distribution for Reduced NOx Emission From Aircraft Engines", "abstract": "Measurements of the emissions from an experimental engine were analyzed to construct a design chart for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in conventional combustors.

The luminosity is a factor of at least 3.4 greater than measured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) 4 days later. This difference may be related to the emergence from the nucleus on 1996 September 9 of a dust-rich cloud. Over the next few days, the cloud continued to expand, becoming increasingly tenuous until it had reached an extent of ~3\u00d7105 km (or ~2') by the start of the EUVE observation.

In addition, it avoids the conversion of land use for crop production. This is a strong advantage for Singapore which has relatively smaller land space than other countries. The import of virgin oil as feedstock into Singapore is also avoided. Therefore, the more appropriate feedstock to produce biodiesel in Singapore context is WCO. According to the National Environment Agency, diesel vehicles in Singapore contribute 50% of the total particulate matter smaller than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM0.25) emissions to air ambient. Hence, the aim of this life cycle assessment study was to compare the environmental performances of biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel in terms of global warming potential, life cycle energy efficiency (LCEE) and fossil energy ratio (FER) using the life cycle inventory. The results of this study would serve as a reference for energy policy makers and environmental agencies.Materials and methodsISO14040 and ISO14044 (ISO14040 2006; ISO 14044 2006) are used as the method for implementing this study. This comparative study between biodiesel derived from WCO and low sulphur diesel is done by comparing the life cycle inventory results. The tailpipe emission tests were done using a gas analyser.ResultsBiodiesel production data are collected from a local facility. The production of main ingredients, types of transportation, conversion of WCO to biodiesel and the usage of biodiesel were considered within the dataset. Production of low sulphur diesel was modelled according to several references. The phases include foreign crude oil production, refining, transporting of diesel to station and finally the usage of diesel. The testing vehicle for both transportation fuels is an ISUZU pickup truck with engine capacity of 3,059\u00a0cc and in direct injection combustion chamber type. The functional unit in this study is output of 1\u00a0transportation-km.DiscussionIn this section, two types of emissions are discussed. First is the net life cycle emission. The second is the exhaust tailpipe emissions. Highest amount of reduction on a life cycle basis is PM2.5 and PM10 with a significant reduction of 99.99%. On the exhaust tailpipe emission basis, the reduction for total particulate matter is 94.80%. The LCEE of biodiesel produced from WCO is calculated as 86.93%. This is higher than biodiesel reported from US studies (using soybean as feedstock) which is 80.55%. The low LCEE value of 71.09% for low sulphur diesel could be attributed by the fact that Singapore depends greatly on foreign crude oil production and imports. The FER is calculated to be 9.39. The life cycle of biodiesel produced from the recycling of WCO produces more than nine times as much energy in its final fuel product as it uses in fossil energy. This is three times higher than biodiesel derived from soya oil in the USA.ConclusionsThe emission results and the life cycle energy efficiencies have indicated that the replacement of low sulphur diesel with biodiesel derived from WCO as a transportation fuel is favourable.Recommendations and perspectivesIn Singapore, the potential substitution percentage of diesel by biodiesel if all of the WCO can be collected and processed to biodiesel is 1.42%. There is a need for recyclers to convince the food establishments and users of cooking oil of the benefits of recycling cooking oil, which in turn obtains a steady source of WCO as feedstock for biodiesel production. In addition, as the biodiesel life cycle defined is very much dependent on WCO as a feedstock, it is recommended to optimise the WCO collection network.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "abf72deb47da347362f0727a3f414d65476c2548", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1997394664", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1573341", "CorpusId": 31129924}, "title": "Photoluminescence and damage recovery studies in Fe-implanted ZnO single crystals", "abstract": "We report Fe3+-related emission in ion-implanted ZnO single crystals.

The emission behavior of the single NQD when approaching the AgTip at the nanometer scale was measured using off-resonance (405 nm) and resonance (465 nm) excitation of the LSP. We directly observed the conversion of the single-photon emission from a single NQD to multiphoton emission with reduction of the emission lifetime at both excitation wavelengths as the NQD-AgTip distance decreased, whereas a decrease and increase in the emission intensity were observed at 405 and 465 nm excitation, respectively. By combining theoretical analysis and the numerical simulation of the AgTip, we deduced that the enhancement of the multiphoton emission was caused by the quenching of the single-exciton state due to the energy transfer from the NQD to the AgTip and that the emission intensity was increased by enhancement of the excitation rate due to the electric field of the LSP on the AgTip.

Fire regimes are likely to affect the productivity and carbon sequestration potential of savannas, through effects on both biomass and carbon emissions. The carbon sequestration potential has been estimated for some savanna sites by quantifying carbon storage in biomass and soil pools, and the fluxes to these pools. Using different techniques, previous work in these savannas has indicated that net ecosystem productivity [NEP, net primary productivity (NPP) less heterotrophic respiration] was about -3 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). However, the impacts of fire were not accounted for in these calculations. Estimates of NEP have been combined with remotely-sensed estimates of area burnt and associated emissions for an extensive area of mesic savanna in Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. Combining NEP estimates with precise fire data provides an estimate of net biome productivity (NBP), a production index that includes carbon loss through disturbance (fire), and is thus a more realistic indicator of sequestration rate from this biome. This preliminary analysis suggests that NBP is approximately -1 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). A reduction in the annual area burnt is likely to increase the sink size.

In addition, ethylene and H\u2082O\u2082 modulated NaCl-induced alternative oxidase gene (AOX1a) expression and the increase in pyruvate content in WT calluses. Inhibition of the AP by salicylhydroxamic acid in WT calluses under salt stress resulted in severe cellular damage as indicated by the high content of H\u2082O\u2082, malondialdehyde and more electrolyte leakage. Taken together, ethylene and H\u2082O\u2082 are involved in the salt-induced increase of the AP, which plays an important role in salt tolerance in WT calluses, and ethylene may be acting downstream of H\u2082O\u2082.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "5064ddb762f620f04571f6b6ae1e753fe121aa36", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030336952", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJHYDENE.2005.10.002", "CorpusId": 95688725}, "title": "Emissions reduction benefits from hydrogen addition to midsize gas turbine feedstocks", "abstract": null, "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "d0f9765989c07d7155f346a080193edd79ce1c4f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2113269889", "DOI": "10.5194/AMT-4-2809-2011", "CorpusId": 54030574}, "title": "Towards space based verification of CO 2 emissions from strong localized sources: fossil fuel power plant emissions as seen by a CarbonSat constellation", "abstract": "Abstract. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important man-made greenhouse gas (GHG) that cause global warming. With electricity generation through fossil-fuel power plants now being the economic sector with the largest source of CO2, power plant emissions monitoring has become more important than ever in the fight against global warming. In a previous study done by Bovensmann et al. (2010), random and systematic errors of power plant CO2 emissions have been quantified using a single overpass from a proposed CarbonSat instrument. In this study, we quantify errors of power plant annual emission estimates from a hypothetical CarbonSat and constellations of several CarbonSats while taking into account that power plant CO2 emissions are time-dependent. Our focus is on estimating systematic errors arising from the sparse temporal sampling as well as random errors that are primarily dependent on wind speeds. We used hourly emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological fields from the National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP). CarbonSat orbits were simulated as a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite (LEO) with an 828-km orbit height, local time ascending node (LTAN) of 13:30 (01:30 p.m. LT) and achieves global coverage after 5 days. We show, that despite the variability of the power plant emissions and the limited satellite overpasses, one CarbonSat has the potential to verify reported US annual CO2 emissions from large power plants (\u22655 Mt CO2 yr\u22121) with a systematic error of less than ~4.9% and a random error of less than ~6.7% for 50% of all the power plants. For 90% of all the power plants, the systematic error was less than ~12.4% and the random error was less than ~13%. We additionally investigated two different satellite configurations using a combination of 5 CarbonSats. One achieves global coverage everyday but only samples the targets at fixed local times. The other configuration samples the targets five times at two-hour intervals approximately every 6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 days. From the statistical analyses, we found, as expected, that the random errors improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellites are used. On the other hand, more satellites do not result in a large reduction of the systematic error. The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage everyday. Therefore, we recommend the CarbonSat constellation configuration that achieves daily global coverage.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "6eb5f1959ca77396004e4d86be09b1d2417e04ac", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5686079", "MAG": "2766564513", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-017-01410-w", "CorpusId": 205552833, "PubMed": "29138387"}, "title": "Strategies for feeding the world more sustainably with organic agriculture", "abstract": "Organic agriculture is proposed as a promising approach to achieving sustainable food systems, but its feasibility is also contested.

Carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs) are widely used in industry and are effective in reducing the overall social cost of emissions abatement. This article reports the development of a downstream ETS for the transportation sector and its application in Shenzhen, China. The ETS was devised as a mandatory cap-and-trade scheme and, as a first step, was applied to public transportation. An integrated cap was set on the total emissions from buses and taxis: an absolute cap for existing vehicles and a relative increment for new entrants. Allowances were allocated by grandfathering or benchmarking and a \u2018reverse mechanism\u2019 was established to encourage the transformation of urban transportation to a low-carbon system. Online fuel consumption monitoring was used to quantify the emissions from vehicles, and the operators were required to surrender enough allowances or credits to account for their verified annual emissions. The mechanisms for allowance trading and carbon offsets provided sufficient flexibility to make emissions abatement and the use of new-energy vehicles and environmentally friendly travel within Shenzhen's urban transportation system economically attractive. Policy relevance The transportation sector is becoming a major contributor to the growth in China's GHG emissions. Achieving large reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector is a great challenge and requires both technology and policy innovation. The tradable carbon permit is a popular concept in mitigating climate change, but the introduction of a cap-and-trade ETS into the transportation sector is a relatively innovative concept. Shenzhen has launched the first cap-and-trade ETS in a developing country and is currently exploring ways to mitigate carbon emissions by a downstream cap-and-trade ETS for the transportation sector. This article considers the main institutional arrangements and regulatory framework of Shenzhen's transportation carbon ETS.

In these circumstances, what does justice require the United States to do? Many people believe that the United States is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions beyond the point that is justified by its own self-interest, simply because the United States is wealthy, and because the nations most at risk from climate change are poor. This argument from distributive justice is complemented by an argument from corrective justice: The existing \"stock\" of greenhouse gas emissions owes a great deal to the past actions of the United States, and many people think that the United States should do a great deal to reduce a problem for which it is largely responsible. But there are serious difficulties with both of these arguments. Redistribution from the United States to poor people in poor nations might well be desirable, but if so, expenditures on greenhouse gas reductions are a crude means of producing that redistribution: It would be much better to give cash payments directly to people who are now poor. The argument from corrective justice runs into the standard problems that arise when collectivities, such as nations, are treated as moral agents: Many people who have not acted wrongfully end up being forced to provide a remedy to many people who have not been victimized. The conclusion is that while a suitably designed climate change agreement is in the interest of the world, a widely held view is wrong: Arguments from distributive and corrective justice fail to provide strong justifications for imposing special obligations for greenhouse gas reductions on the United States.

In addition, the future CO2 emissions of industry from 2013 to 2020 under three scenarios were estimated, and the reduction potential of CO2 emissions in industry are 335\u00a0Mt in 2020 under lower-emission scenario while the CO2 emission difference between higher-emission scenario and lower-emission scenario is nearly 725\u00a0Mt.

Evaluating the implementation effectiveness of the seven pilot ETSs in China is critical for designing this national system. This study administered a questionnaire survey to assess the behaviour of enterprises covered by the seven ETS pilots from the perspective of: the strictness of compliance measures; rules for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV); the mitigation pressure felt by enterprises; and actual mitigation and trading activities. The results show that the pilot MRV and compliance rules have not yet been fully implemented. The main factors involved are the lack of compulsory force of the regulations and the lack of policy awareness within the affected enterprises. Most enterprises have a shortage of free allowances and thus believe that the ETSs have increased their production costs. Most enterprises have already established mitigation targets. Some of the covered enterprises are aware of their own internal emission reduction costs and most of these have used this as an important reference in trading. Many enterprises have accounted for carbon prices in their long-term investment. The proportion of enterprises that have participated in trading is fairly high; however, reluctance to sell is quite pervasive in the market, and enterprises are mostly motivated to trade simply in order to achieve compliance. Few enterprises are willing to manage their allowances in a market-oriented manner. Different free allowance allocation methods directly affect the pathways enterprises take to control emissions. Key policy insights In the national ETS, the compulsory force of ETS provisions should be strengthened. A reasonable level of free allowance shortage should be ensured to promote emission reduction by enterprises. Sufficient information should be provided to guide enterprises in their allowance management to activate the market. To promote the implementation of mitigation technologies by enterprises, actual output-based allocation methods should be used. The government should use market adjustment mechanisms, such as a price floor and ceiling, to ensure that carbon prices are reasonable and stable, so as to guide long-term low carbon investment.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "71013bafddd9d1e2f29a199a148adabe61d05cd0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2245593519", "CorpusId": 16556735}, "title": "The limits of technology: achieving transport efficiency in developing nations", "abstract": "Emissions from the transport sector represent the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. There is little prospect that this situation will be resolved with a single technological fix. As developing nations quickly move to catch up with the motorisation levels of developed nations, the sheer number of private vehicles on the roadways will overwhelm any advances made by cleaner fuels. By the year 2030, there is projected to be more vehicles in the developing world than in developed nations. However, most developing cities today still have the basis for a more sustainable future. Public transport and non-motorised transport (walking and cycling) still command a dominant share of travel in developing cities. Thus, a key objective for local and international initiatives is to preserve existing mode shares.

But motor fuels also generate emissions throughout the fuel cycle, from crude oil production to refining, storage, transportation, and handling, that can make significant contributions to the total inventory of VOC emissions. Many of these sources of emissions are directly related to the quantity of fuel produced and handled throughout the fuel cycle. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that a reduction in total fuel throughput might result in a reduction of VOC emissions.

The work is based on a Westport HPDI fuelling system, which provides direct injection of both natural gas and liquid diesel into the combustion chamber of an otherwise unmodified diesel engine. The diesel acts as a pilot to ignite the natural gas, which normally burns in a non-premixed fashion, leading to significant PM formation. The concepts to reduce PM evaluated in this work are: 1) adjusting the relative phasing of the natural gas and diesel injections to allow more premixing of the natural gas prior to ignition; 2) reducing the pilot quantity to increase the ignition delay of the gas jet; and 3) reducing the level of EGR at select modes to reduce PM formation. These strategies are evaluated at steady state using single- and multi-cylinder research engines, supported by CFD analysis. The results demonstrate that allowing limited premixing of the gas jet prior to ignition can significantly reduce PM emissions. Excessive premixing can lead to high rates of pressure rise; EGR can be used to moderate the combustion under these conditions, without causing increased PM emissions. Reducing pilot quantity is another effective technique to reduce PM, primarily by allowing more air to mix with the gas jet before ignition. These various techniques can be combined to form a new operating strategy that significantly reduces engine-out PM and NOx emissions compared to the baseline strategy without significantly impacting fuel consumption.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "12b4e5f74f72440b446992108b9c017aa3e8ee0a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030585316", "DOI": "10.1007/s11367-012-0425-8", "CorpusId": 109614362}, "title": "Regional assessment of local emissions of electric vehicles using traffic simulations for a use case in Germany", "abstract": "PurposeIn order to assess the global and local environmental impacts of different penetration rates of electric vehicles (EVs) within a region, we developed a life cycle approach based on a detailed traffic simulation assessing local emissions for individual roads with a high time resolution. The aim was to estimate the reduction potential of local emissions such as particulate matter within a region through a substitution of conventional with electric vehicles.Materials and methodsThe chosen approach assessing local emissions includes a detailed traffic simulation of a vehicle fleet composed of individual vehicles with a daily schedule. The driving pattern is modeled based on a survey of driving patterns in Germany. Incorporation of traffic density for each road and emissions of electric and conventional vehicles permits conclusions on the reduction potential for each street. Moreover, a feasible reduction potential for a particular region can be assessed. A case study for Aachen, Germany is presented within this paper. For the classification of the local emissions with the usual life cycle assessment approach, a comparison of EV, PHEV, and conventional vehicles has been conducted for Germany providing the results for impact categories according to CML 2001.Results and discussionBased on simulation results, an estimation of the reduction potential for Aachen for different penetration rates of electric vehicles including particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxygen (NOx) is carried out. Electric vehicles possess the highest reduction potential for CO and NOx. Assuming 50\u00a0% of the total vehicle fleet in 2010 substituted by electric vehicles, local emissions of CO reduce by 46.6\u00a0%, for NOx by 38.8\u00a0%, and for PM10 by 22.4\u00a0%. Due to fluctuations in driving patterns throughout a day, the results are highly time dependent. However, improvements in combustion engine technologies results in an increased reduction potential for conventional vehicles. The direct comparison between the vehicle types showed that the benefit of electric vehicles depends on the considered impact category.ConclusionsElectric vehicles are able to reduce local emissions within a region. Moreover, this approach focusing on the use phase of vehicles within a regional assessment and the resulting local emissions as well as the detailed analysis of the driving behavior allows a distinguished assessment of the reduction potential of electric vehicles.

For diesel buses, PN emissions are not significantly different between acceleration and operation at steady maximum power. However, the corresponding PN emissions from CNG buses when accelerating are an order of magnitude greater than when operating at steady maximum power. During acceleration under heavy load, PN emissions from CNG buses are an order of magnitude higher than from diesel buses. The particles emitted from CNG buses are too small to contribute to PM(10) emissions or contribute to a reduction of visibility and may consist of semivolatile nanoparticles.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "6f7d7d2bffa49165708e3bd1677136104d1715fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2954169184", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.JPCC.9B04002", "CorpusId": 198338174}, "title": "Transition Metal Ion-Based Nanocrystalline Luminescent Thermometry in SrTiO3:Ni2+,Er3+ Nanocrystals Operating in the Second Optical Window of Biological Tissues", "abstract": "Luminescence thermometry in the second and third optical windows of biological tissues has gained importance in recent years due to the reduction of both absorption and scattering effects in human tissues, which substantially increase its applicative potential.

It was hypothesized that increased irrigation frequency would result in lower NO emissions by increasing soil moisture and decreasing soil O concentrations. This would favor more NO reduction to dinitrogen (N). We examined effects of high (3-d) versus low (6-d) irrigation frequency with and without bovine urine addition to pasture. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured daily for 35 d. Soil O, temperature, and water content were continuously measured at multiple depths.

Potential capture sources have been identified and the potential for CO2 capture has been estimated based on branch- and plant-specific conditions. Emphasis is placed here on three branches of industry with promising prospects for CCS: mineral oil refineries, iron and steel, and cement manufacturers.\n\nFindings \u2013 A relatively small number (~270) of large installations (>500,000?tCO2/year) dominates emissions from the three branches investigated in this study. Together these installations emit 432?MtCO2/year, 8 percent of EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. If the full potential of emerging CO2 capture technologies was realized, some 270-330?MtCO2 emissions could be avoided annually. Further, several regions have been singled out as particularly suitable to facilitate integrated CO2 transport networks. The most promising prospects for an early deployment of CCS are found in the regions bordering the North Sea.\n\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 Replacement/retrofitting of the existing plant stock will involve large investments and deployment will take time. It is thus important to consider how the current industry structure influences the potential to reduce CO2 in the short- medium and long term. It is concluded that the age structure of the existing industry plant stock and its implications for the timing and deployment rate of CO2 capture and other mitigation measures are important and should therefore be further investigated.\n\nPractical implications \u2013 CCS has been recognized as a key option for reducing CO2 emissions within the EU. This assessment shows that considerable emission reductions could be achieved by targeting large point sources in some of the most emission-intensive industries. Yet, a number of challenges need to be resolved in all parts of the CCS chain.

Dutch agriculture, including horticulture, also contributes 14% (32 Mton CO2-eq in 2016) to the national emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG). These emissions hardly decreased since 2000.

The relative reduction target for GHG by agriculture is 11% and less than the national target of 49%, but still is a challenge because the technical potential for reduction of methane and nitrous oxides is relatively small. Apart from technical measures and innovations, there is an increasing call in society for structural measures, like reduction of livestock, to assure an appropriate reduction of GHG emission from agriculture. However there are also concerns about leakage effects when livestock production would increase elsewhere, e.g.in the EU, causing a net increase of GHG emission and increased local environmental pollution. We carried out a Life Cycle Analysis for production of milk, pork, poultry, potato and wheat in other EU countries which disclosed that GHG emission per unit of product in the Netherlands is similar to that in Germany and France, while lower than in central and southern EU. Nitrogen and phosphorus surplus per unit of product for Dutch products often are higher due to the high use of manure. These results indicate that the risk of transboundary leakage effects likely are small when implementing PCA for agriculture in the Netherlands or stricter environmental policies, also when including reduction of livestock production.
