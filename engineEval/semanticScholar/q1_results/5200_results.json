The empirical study focuses on two interlinked questions: (1) How sulphur emission reduction policies are being anticipated by maritime industry, in particular by Baltic ports and (2) How port adaptation strategies are tied into Baltic local and energy contexts. Addressing these questions highlights the role of polycentricity in shipping governance and explains how the same universal international regulations can produce varying patterns of governance.

Germany is targeting an overall primary energy consumption reduction of 50% in 2050 including increasing building renovation rate to 2% per year. In France, ambitious targets have also been set for existing buildings: 50% reduction of primary energy consumption in 2050 compared to the 2012 level.

This report is the first national assessment of the indirect impacts of the NPS-FM on New Zealand\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The water quality improvement aspect of New Zealand\u2019s freshwater reforms are expected to drive significant changes in land and water management across the country. Emissions benefits through the freshwater reforms could potentially result in significant savings for New Zealand by starting the transition to low emissions in the agricultural sector and helping to achieve New Zealand\u2019s overall climate goals. For farmers, changes in land use and management to meet water quality targets will reduce their potential future exposure to needs to reduce GHG emissions. GHG emissions reductions are a combination of reduced emissions through changes in management and de-stocking and increased carbon sequestration associated with planting riparian buffers or afforesting part of the farm. Key results are that without land use change, agricultural GHGs (primarily methane and nitrous oxide) could be reduced by 2.4% or 0.82 million metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent per annum (MtCO2e/yr) along with an additional 0.11 MtCO2e of forest carbon sequestration as a result of planting riparian buffers and pole planting for erosion control (for a net reduction of 0.92 MtCO2e/yr or 13%). If afforestation is perceived to be a feasible freshwater mitigation option, up to 800 000 ha of additional trees could be planted, thereby increasing carbon sequestration by 5.4 MtCO2-e/yr. In this case gross (net) GHGs could be reduced by 2.9 (8.2) MtCO2e/yr, primarily through reduction in stock numbers and increases in forest carbon sequestration. This option could reduce net emissions by nearly 80%. The majority of the emissions impact occurs in the sheep and beef sector, with a gross (net) reduction of 0.61 (0.72) MtCO2e/yr. Nitrogen targets most strongly drive on-farm GHG reductions for all the modelled scenarios that limit mitigation to on-farm changes. This is primarily because actions to mitigate N are most closely related to practices that can also mitigate GHGs (e.g. stock management).", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "989c19e58803236d98e4fb9b8b49337ea9b36e74", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2231422753", "DOI": "10.1007/978-981-287-826-7_3", "CorpusId": 53961082}, "title": "India\u2019s GHG Emission Reduction and Sustainable Development", "abstract": "India has made voluntary commitment for reducing the emission intensity of GDP in the year 2020 by 20\u201325 % below that in the year 2005.

AWD effectively reduced water use compared to continuous flooding (CF) but did not significantly reduce rice grain yield and soil carbon content in all sites.

The largest contributions to emissions are attributed to ruminant methane production and nitrous oxide from animal waste and fertilised soils. Further, livestock, including ruminants, are an important component of global and Australian food production and there is a growing demand for animal protein sources. At the same time as governments and the community strengthen objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are growing concerns about global food security. This paper provides an overview of a number of options for reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions from ruminant production systems in Australia, while maintaining productivity to contribute to both objectives. Options include strategies for feed modification, animal breeding and herd management, rumen manipulation and animal waste and fertiliser management. Using currently available strategies, some reductions in emissions can be achieved, but practical commercially available techniques for significant reductions in methane emissions, particularly from extensive livestock production systems, will require greater time and resource investment. Decreases in the levels of emissions from these ruminant systems (i.e., the amount of emissions per unit of product such as meat) have already been achieved. However, the technology has not yet been developed for eliminating production of methane from the rumen of cattle and sheep digesting the cellulose and lignin-rich grasses that make up a large part of the diet of animals grazing natural pastures, particularly in arid and semi-arid grazing lands.

While great advances have been made in encodable probes,[1] molecular labels,[2] ultrabright emitters,[3] and specific coupling chemistries,[4] the benefits of a single combined technology offering small size, bright emission, and potential genetic encodability has yet to be realized. Within the past few years, few-atom silver nanoclusters have offered promise to combine small size and potentially ultrabright emission in a variety of scaffolds, which stabilize silver nanocluster emission ranging in brightness from that of typical organic dyes[5] to that exceeding brightness of semiconductor quantum dots.[6,7] Based on a nucleolus-bound silver binding protein, we report a significant advance toward utilizing silver nanocluster emission within living cells and the potential for further optimization of small peptide scaffolds for improved nanocluster optical properties. \n \nFrequently used by pathologists, silver nanoparticle-based staining has been utilized to detect nucleolus organizing regions within cells and thus partially reveal nucleolus location.[8,9] This method is thought to reflect cell proliferation activity of potentially cancerous cells.[10] The rather harsh, general protocol for nucleolar silver staining within fixed cells (>5.8 M silver nitrate, 60 \u00b0C) yields large metallic silver nanoparticles that appear as dark spots under brightfield microscopy or electron microscopy due to the interaction between argyrophilic proteins and silver.[11] Considering the specific nucleolar staining with large silver nanoparticles, we expected that fluorescent silver nanoclusters could be produced in vivo in the nucleoli of cells by ambient temperature photoactivation, and that one of the known silver-binding proteins, nucleolin, may serve as a guide for templating the high efficiency creation of fluorescent silver nanoclusters. \n \nAlthough encountering problems with alteration of activity and autofluorescence, especially at low copy numbers, live cell imaging studies often employ GFP fusions, expensive fluorescent antibodies, or specifically designed dyes against certain subcellular components for visualization via fluorescence microscopy.[12] Circumventing background emission, novel long-lived europium complexes designed for nucleolar targeting can be temporally distinguished using time-gated microscopy.[13] While such long-lived emitters increase bulk S/N, their low emission rates preclude observation of low copy numbers. Recent instrumental developments now enable imaging of very short lifetime materials as well.[14] Such fast (\u223c100 ps) gating could enable fast emitters to be observed before standard (ns) dyes begin to emit. When combined with silver nanoclusters exhibiting picosecond lifetimes,[6,15] high S/N imaging of noble metal nanoclusters should be readily accomplished even in the presence of other dyes. \n \nContrary to the ordinary harsh silver staining conditions, fluorescent silver nanocluster formation can be initiated and used to stain the cells at much lower AgNO3 concentrations (20 mM, supplementary materials) via ambient temperature photoactivation. Such images (Fig. 1) always emphasize several bright regions reminiscent of nucleoli, on top of weak cytoplasmic and nuclear emission. The emission intensity of the \u2018bright regions\u2019 is about twice the intensity of that from the cytoplasm, and exhibits broad spectra between 500-700 nm under blue excitation (supplementary materials), likely resulting from multiple emissive species of 2-7 Ag atoms in the cells. The spectra differ somewhat among different cellular components, with the bright spots exhibiting slightly higher ratios of red to green emission than cytoplasm. The emission of the silver-stained cells is quite fast (220 ps (33%) and 1760 ps (67%)) and very stable, maintaining more than 50% intensity for 25 min of continuous illumination at 1 mW/cm2 (supplementary materials). To confirm fluorescent silver nucleolar staining, colocalization experiments were performed with SYTO\u00ae RNASelect green fluorescence stain (Invitrogen). As shown in Fig. 1, the merged image (D) of RNASelect fluorescence (B, BP 515 - 525; green channel) and fluorescent nanocluster silver staining (C, LP 665; red channel) confirms nucleolar staining. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nEmission from formaldehyde-fixed NIH 3T3 cells loaded with 100 mM silver nitrate for 20 hrs.

The 212-ps IRF-broadened emission centered at the nucleus increases to its maximum intensity within 320 ps and then fades to the autofluorescence level within a further 1500 ps. The variation in emission intensity of cellular images is in line with the lifetime decay of the silver clusters in cells. Not only is this the first report of silver fluorescence of cells, but to our knowledge, is also the first report collecting short-time emission to increase S/N by temporally rejecting slower emission from other co-loaded dyes or autofluorescence. \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \nTime-gated images of NIH 3T3 cells stained with silver nitrate.

Unfortunately, nucleolin is far too large to be useful as a label. Ligands which can protect the silver clusters are indispensable as the silver clusters are very vulnerable, with reduction potential decreasing from 0.799 V of the conventional silver electrode to -1.8 V of free silver atom.[17] This implies that the newly-formed silver clusters will be oxidized quickly if no protection is available. As the silver binding site is unknown, we designed a short peptide KECDKKECDKKECDK (P1), incorporating the specific amino acids most prevalent in nucleolin: glutamic acid (15.6%), lysine (12.7%), and aspartic acid (8.5%). We also incorporated several cystine groups based on the known strong silver affinity of thionein.[18] This nucleolin-inspired peptide (P1) forms and stabilizes fluorescent silver clusters directly in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), indicating a strong interaction between silver and ligand. However, the silver clusters protected with P1 (P1-Ag) in aqueous solution are only moderately stable at room temperature (chemical lifetime, 3 days). The short peptide length may limit nanocluster stability due to greater vulnerability to oxygen and chloride ion in aqueous solution. In separate ongoing studies of silver nanocluster creation in specifically designed dendrimers, we observed that hydrophobic regions facilitate the formation of silver clusters (unpublished), leading us to improve the peptide by incorporating several hydrophobic amino acids to yield HDCHLHLHDCHLHLHCDH (P2) and HDCNKDKHDCNKDKHDCN (P3). Silver clusters protected with P2 and P3 (P2-Ag and P3-Ag) are much more stable (chemical lifetime, 2 weeks in deionized water and 5 weeks in PBS, respectively). Nevertheless, all the peptide-protected silver clusters are stable at -20 \u00b0C for at least one month. \n \nThese silver clusters exhibit similar photophysics to those in the nucleolus, but with narrower emissions at 610 nm (P1-Ag), 615 nm (P2-Ag) or 630 nm (P3-Ag) (Fig. 3A and supplementary materials). The MALDI mass spectrometry confirms the presence of silver clusters, in which Ag2, Ag3, Ag4, or Ag5 are bound to a single peptide (Fig. 3B). The fluorescence decay of P1-Ag can be fit biexponentially, with a fast component of 260 ps (58%), and a slow component of 2300 ps (42%). Silver clusters prepared in P2 and P3 also exhibit similar lifetimes (P2-Ag: 73 ps (15%) and 1900 ps (85%); P3-Ag: 420 ps (36%) and 2900 ps (64%). The photophysical similarity between silver-stained cells and peptide-protected silver clusters also strongly supports the observation of fluorescent silver clusters in cells. This in turn indicates that nucleolin as well as other argyrophilic proteins can be very useful guides for biocompatible silver cluster preparation. \n \n \n \nFigure 3 \n \nPhotophysics of P3-Ag and its cell loading.

The P3-Ag also passes through the nuclear membrane, resulting in the weak nuclear staining. The methanol-fixed cells loaded with P3-Ag for 1 hr (Fig. 3C, c) show evenly distributed silver cluster emission in the cytoplasm and strong nuclear staining of some organelles.

In one regime, called the plan-efficient regime, the sector is assumed to follow official plans with regard to investment in new capacity. In the other regime, called the cost-efficient regime, the thermal power sector is assumed to behave in a cost minimizing manner. The effects of the proposed EC carbon/energy tax are studied under both regimes, giving rise to altogether four scenarios.In both regimes the effect of the EC tax is to reduce emissions by between 6 and 10 per cent in year 2000 relative to the scenarios without the tax. A change of regime, from the regulated, plan-efficient regime to the market-based, cost-efficient regime, will, by itself, reduce emissions of CO2 and NOx by approximately 3 per cent, while SO2 emissions are reduced by 13 per cent. The EC tax will reduce sulphur deposition by more than 5 per cent in the nine model countries under the plan-efficient regime. A change of regime further reduces the total deposition by 9 per cent. The area where depositions exceed the critical load is reduced by approximately 6 per cent in year 2000 by the tax in both regimes. Changing from the plan-efficient to the cost-efficient regime has a similar impact.Although the emission reductions due to the EC tax may seem modest, they are shown to have a sizeable effect on the technological abatement costs of reaching targets like those prescribed in the Sofia protocol on the stabilisation of NOx emissions, and the Helsinki protocol on SO2 emission reductions. This is part of what can be considered to be secondary benefits of the EC carbon/energy tax.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "ade9140ac0ed0084d7390ba1646550c07e613de6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048662510", "DOI": "10.1021/ol702873z", "CorpusId": 29571436, "PubMed": "18232698"}, "title": "Facile synthesis of 9,10-diarylphenanthrenes and poly(9,10-diarylphenanthrene)s.", "abstract": "One-pot reduction of 9,10-diaryl-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-9,10-diols to 9,10-diarylphenanthrenes was achieved with Zn/H+ in acetic acid.

While in earlier decades, Europe followed automobile technology leaps initiated in the USA, it has decoupled itself for 20 years by focusing research capacity towards the diesel powertrain. The resulting technology shift has led to some 45 million extra diesel cars in Europe. Its outcome in terms of health and environmental effects will be investigated below.ResultsExpected greenhouse gas savings initiated by the shift to diesel cars have been overestimated. Only about one tenth of overall energy efficiency improvements of passenger cars can be attributed to it. These minor savings are on the other hand overcompensated by a significant increase of supply chain CO2 emissions and extensive black carbon emissions of diesel cars without particulate filter. We conclude that the European diesel car boom did not cool down the atmosphere. Moreover, toxic NOx emissions of diesel cars have been underestimated up to 20-fold in officially announced data. The voluntary agreement signed in 1998 between the European Automobile industry and the European Commission envisaging to reduce CO2 emissions has been identified as elementary for the ensuing European diesel car boom. Four factors have been quantified in order to explain very different dieselization rates across Europe: impact of national car/supplier industry, ecological modernization, fuel tourism and corporatist political governance. By comparing the European diesel strategy to the Japanese petrol-hybrid avenue, it becomes clear that a different road would have both more effectively reduced CO2 emissions and pollutants.ConclusionEurope's car fleets have been persistently transformed from being petrol-driven to diesel-driven over the last 20 years. This paper investigates on how this came to be and why Europe took a distinct route as compared to other parts of the world. It also attempts to evaluate the outcome of stated goals of this transformation which was primarily a robust reduction in GHG emissions.

We estimate cumulative CO2 emissions during the period 2000 to 2050 from developed and developing countries based on the empirical relationship between CO2 per capita emissions (due to fossil fuel combustion and cement production) and corresponding HDI. We choose not to include emissions from land use and other greenhouse gases since they were found not to be strongly correlated with personal consumption and national carbon intensities [1]. In addition, data of past CO2 emissions from land use is uncertain due to the lack of historical data of both former ecosystem conditions and the extent of subsequent land use [2]. In order to project per capita emissions of individual countries we make three assumptions which are detailed below. First, we use logistic regressions to fit and extrapolate the HDI on a country level as a function of time. This is mainly motivated by the fact that the HDI is bounded between 0 and 1 and that it decelerates as it approaches 1. Second, we employ for individual countries the correlations between CO2 per capita emissions and HDI in order to extrapolate their emissions. This is an ergodic assumption, i.e. that the process over time and over the statistical ensemble is the same. Third, we let countries with incomplete data records evolve similarly as their close neighbors (in the emissions-HDI plane, see Fig. 1 in the main text) with complete time series of CO2 per capita emissions and HDI.

Threshold values of these indicator species and ratios, delineating the transition between VOG and NOx sensitivity, were proposed. Subsequently, measurement studies have assumed the universality of these threshold criteria and have compared local observed indicators with previously established criteria to assess ozone sensitivities. In this study the concept of indicator species is extended to combinations of observable species that are consistently associated with different site characteristics (e.g., ozone sensitivities and emissions features). The results of SARMAP Air Quality Model (SAQM) simulations in the San Joaquin Valley, California, are used to investigate the applicability of indicators to assess ozone sensitivities and emissions features. The use of three indicator ratios (O3/(NOy-NOx), HCHO/NO2 and H2O2/HNO3) along with SAQM-derived threshold criteria is found to be effective for identifying VOC- or NOx-sensitive regimes. NOy and (NOy-NOx)NOy are found to be useful in describing emission features and threshold criteria are derived by SAQM prediction. SAQM-derived threshold criteria for assessing ozone sensitivities are found to differ from threshold criteria proposed by previous studies using different models and under different conditions. Such differences suggest that threshold criteria are likely to be dependent on locations and environmental conditions, including emission patterns and rates. Therefore local observed indicator species and ratios can be used to determine ozone sensitivities only if appropriate threshold criteria have been derived for the local conditions.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "cf1d6d0aef8447963f7ede39c5ca68948191dca7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1967494048", "DOI": "10.1021/nl103243n", "CorpusId": 28895, "PubMed": "21171627"}, "title": "Efficient and directed Nano-LED emission by a complete elimination of transverse-electric guided modes.", "abstract": "A key to the success of solid-state lighting is an ultraefficient light extraction, \u223c90%.

This conference resulted in the Copenhagen Accord, which forms the basis for further negotiations in Cancun, Mexico, later this year. As part of the Copenhagen Accord, industrialised countries have submitted greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2020 and developing countries have submitted actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This report presents an overview of: 1) the global emission implications of all these submissions; 2) the abatement cost implications; 3) the implications for meeting the 2C climate goal, specified in the Copenhagen Accord, 4) the main risks that could increase the existing emissions gap towards 2C, and 5) the available options to close the emissions gap towards 20C. The country submissions for emission reduction could result in a decrease of the global emission level in 2020 from 56 Gt CO2eq to about 49 to 50 Gt CO2eq, against limited costs. For meeting the 2C climate goal, it is estimated that a global emission level of 44 to 46 Gt CO2eq is necessary in 2020. Therefore, although the submissions are expected to lead to substantial emission reductions, higher reductions are necessary in order to maintain a reasonable chance of reaching the 2C climate goal. Several options are identified that could decrease emissions by a further 4 Gt CO2 eq, which would close the emissions gap completely. However, there are also various reasons why the emission reductions resulting from the country submissions could turn out to be much lower and, in fact, could result in almost no reductions at all.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "3fae52282a8cf9bb5b1165a4fa1c7dfc05303c71", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1990306521", "DOI": "10.1021/EF900913P", "CorpusId": 96338096}, "title": "NO Reduction over Biomass Char in the Combustion Process", "abstract": "In the biomass combustion process, fuel N in biomass can be oxidized into NOx, causing acid rain and photochemical smog.

Under certain conditions, ozone levels decrease as a result of a reduction in NOx emissions but do not respond significantly to changes in VOC emissions (NOx-sensitive condition), while under other conditions ozone concentrations decrease in response to reductions in VOCs and may even increase when NOx emissions are reduced (VOC-sensitive conditions).

The model is part of an integrated system of models with a hierarchical structure developed for the study and the optimal design of engine control strategies. In order to reduce the uncertainty due to the mutual interference during the validation phase, the model has been developed accordingly with a hierarchical and sequential structure. The main thermodynamic model is based on the classical two zone approach. A multi-zone model is then derived form the two zone calculation, for a proper evaluation of temperature gradients in the burned gas region. The emissions of HC, CO and NOx are then predicted by three sub-models. In order to make the precision of emission models suitable for engine control design, an identification technique based on decomposition approach has been developed, for the definition of optimal model structure with a minimum number of parameters. The results of the thermodynamic cycle model validation, performed over more than 300 engine operating conditions, show a satisfactory level of agreement between measured and predicted data cycles. Afterward, the two step identification procedure has been applied for the emission models parameters identification.

As/P exchange, which causes a QD size and an emission wavelength that are very large, is suppressed by decreasing the QD growth temperature and V\u2013III flow ratio. As/P exchange, QD size and emission wavelength are then reproducibly controlled by the thickness of ultrathin [0\u20132 monolayers (ML)] GaAs interlayers underneath the QDs. Submonolayer GaAs coverages result in a shape transition from QDs to quantum dashes for a low V\u2013III flow ratio. It is the combination of reduced growth temperature and V\u2013III flow ratio with the insertion of GaAs interlayers of greater than 1 ML thickness which allows the tuning of the emission wavelength of QDs at room temperature in the 1.55 \u00b5m wavelength range. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal the excellent optical properties of the QDs. Widely stacked QD layers are reproduced with identical PL emission to increase the active volume while closely stacked QD layers reveal a systematic PL redshift and linewidth reduction due to vertical electronic coupling, which is proven by the fact that the linear polarization of the cleaved-side PL changes from in-plane to isotropic.

The results show that, after the introduction of the taxes in the early 1990s, carbon dioxide emissions from the Swedish transport sector reduced by around 11 percentage points in an average year relative to a comparable synthetic control unit, with the carbon tax alone affecting a 6 percentage point reduction.

In a 4\u00d74 Latin square design 4 lactating Danish Holstein dairy cows fitted with rumen, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were assigned to 4 calcium ammonium nitrate addition levels: control, low, medium, and high [0, 5.3, 13.6, and 21.1g of nitrate/kg of dry matter (DM), respectively]. Diets were made isonitrogenous by replacing urea. Cows were fed ad libitum and, after a 6-d period of gradual introduction of nitrate, adapted to the corn-silage-based total mixed ration (forage:concentrate ratio 50:50 on DM basis) for 16d before sampling. Digesta content from duodenum, ileum, and feces, and rumen liquid were collected, after which methane production and hydrogen emissions were measured in respiration chambers. Methane production [L/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)] linearly decreased with increasing nitrate concentrations compared with the control, corresponding to a reduction of 6, 13, and 23% for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively. Methane production was lowered with apparent efficiencies (measured methane reduction relative to potential methane reduction) of 82.3, 71.9, and 79.4% for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively. Addition of nitrate increased hydrogen emissions (L/kg of DMI) quadratically by a factor of 2.5, 3.4, and 3.0 (as L/kg of DMI) for the low, medium, and high diets, respectively, compared with the control. Blood methemoglobin levels and nitrate concentrations in milk and urine increased with increasing nitrate intake, but did not constitute a threat for animal health and human food safety.

The model couples the balancing of C, N and energy fluxes with the target to estimate the climate-relevant CO2, CH4 and N2O sources and sinks of farming systems. For the determination of the net greenhouse effect, calculations of C sequestration in the soil, CO2 emissions from the use of fossil energy, CH4 emissions from livestock keeping and N2O emissions from the soil have been made. The results were converted into CO2 equivalents using its specific global warming potential (GWP). The model has been applied in the experimental farm Scheyern in southern Germany, which had been divided into an organic (org) and a conventional (con) farming system in 1992. Rather detailed series of long-term measuring data are available for the farm in Scheyern, which have been used for validating the software for its efficiency and applicability under very different management yet nearly equal site conditions. The organic farm is multi-structured with a legume-based crop rotation (N2 fixation: 83 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The livestock density (LSU=Livestock Unit according to FAO) is 1.4 LSU ha\u22121. The farm is oriented on closed mass cycles; from the energetic point of view it represents a low-input system (energy input 4.5 GJ ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The conventional farm is a simple-structured cash crop system, based on mineral N (N input 145 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). Regarding the energy consumption, the system is run on high inputs (energy input 14.0 GJ ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The organic crop rotation reaches about 57% (8.3 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the DM yield, about 66% (163 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the N removal and roughly 56% (3741 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121) of the C fixation of the conventional crop rotation. In the organic rotation, 18 GJ per GJ of fossil energy input are bound in the harvested biomass vis-\u00e0-vis 11.1 GJ in the conventional rotation. The strongest influence on the greenhouse effect is exerted by C sequestration and N2O emissions. In Scheyern, C sequestration has set in under organic management (+0.37 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121), while humus depletion has been recorded in the conventional system (\u22120.25 Mg ha\u22121 yr\u22121). Greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) due to fuel consumption and the use of machines are nearly on the same level in both crop rotations. However, the conventional system emits an additional 637 kg CO2 eq ha\u22121 yr\u22121, which had been consumed in the manufacture of mineral N and pesticides in the upstream industry. Besides the analyses in the experimental farm Scheyern, the model has been applied in 28 commercial farms (18 org and 10 con) with comparable soil and climate conditions in the surroundings of Scheyern (mean distance 60 km). The program calculations are aimed at benchmarking the results obtained in the farming systems Scheyern; they are expected to disclose management-specific variations in the emission of climate-relevant gases and to rate the suitability of the model for describing such management-specific effects. In order to make the situation in the farms comparable, only the emissions from cropping systems were analyzed. Livestock keeping remained unconsidered. Due to lower N and energy inputs, clearly lower N2O and CO2 emissions were obtained for the organic farms than for the conventional systems. The analyses have shown possibilities for the optimization of management and the mitigation of GGE. Our findings underline that organic farming includes a high potential for C sequestration and the reduction of GGEs. Currently, the model REPRO is tested by 90 farms in the Federal Republic of Germany with the aim to apply it in the future not only in the field of research but also in the management of commercial farms.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "b891b2e0c5c40d0a292d705f59b61b09751ee1ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980343818", "DOI": "10.1021/AC00121A050", "CorpusId": 93639933}, "title": "Fluorescence detection and identification of nitro derivatives of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons by on-column catalytic reduction to aromatic amines", "abstract": "Nitro derivatives of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH) at trace-level concentrations were efficiently reduced to primary aromatic amines on a catalyst column packed with 5-..mu..m alumina that was coated with platinum and rhodium (Pt/Rh).

Methods and Results Sixteen patients with previous infarction were studied before and after revascularization by myocardial perfusion imaging using 82Rb positron emission tomography, digitized twodimensional echocardiography, and imaging of postexercise FDG uptake. Hibernation was identified in 35 of 85 segments showing perfusion and wall motion disturbances before intervention. At follow-up (4.9\u00b12.6 months after revascularization), hibernating segments were characterized by reduction of wall motion score (p < 0.001), improvement of perfusion (p < 0.001), and reduction of FDG activity (p < 0.00l). Of the 35 hibernating segments, however, 10 still had abnormal elevation of FDG uptake (>2 SD above normal) without differing from other hibernating segments with respect to postoperative perfusion or wall motion score. Segments with persistently abnormal metabolism were characterized before intervention by more severe malperfusion (p < 0.0l) and greater FDG activity (p < 0.0l).

The aim of this research was to determine the influence of pig slurry, as well as its combination with mineral N, on N2O emissions in the field and their relationships with some fractions of soil organic matter, with soil moisture and with rainfall. In spite of varying amounts of organic substance applied, the diverse agronomic treatments did not produce substantial differences in N losses due to denitrification. Wide variations between the slurry fertilized and the urea-fertilized plots were not found, whereas the combination of pig slurry with urea usually produced an increase both in N2O emissions due to denitrification and in direct N2O emissions (N losses corresponding to about 50% of those due to denitrification). The greatest losses of N2O-N occurred in the first month following fertilizer administration. N2O emissions due to denitrification were highest in the days immediately following the administration of fertilizers and lowest in a later period. N2O emissions due to nitrification occurred later. Therefore, N2O emission via nitrification differed from N2O losses via denitrification which, under optimal conditions, presented peaks of activity during the whole growth cycle. The N2O-N losses were highly influenced by physical parameters, particularly rain.

It includes a quantitative assessment of benefits from pre-inspection maintenance and repairs and accounts for the selection bias effect that occurs when intermittent high emitters are tested. We report estimates of one-cycle emission benefits of California's Enhanced Smog Check program, ca. 1999. Program benefits equivalent to metric tons per day of prevented emissions were calculated with a \"bottom-up\" approach that combined average per vehicle reductions in mass emission rates (g/gal) with average per vehicle activity, resolved by model year. Accelerated simulation mode test data from the statewide vehicle information database (VID) and from roadside Smog Check testing were used to determine 2-yr emission profiles of vehicles passing through Smog Check and infer emission profiles that would occur without Smog Check. The number of vehicles participating in Smog Check was also determined from the VID. We estimate that in 1999 Smog Check reduced tailpipe emissions of HC, CO, and NO(x) by 97, 1690, and 81 t/d, respectively. These correspond to 26, 34, and 14% of the HC, CO, and NO(x) that would have been emitted by vehicles in the absence of Smog Check. These estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions about vehicle deterioration in the absence of Smog Check. Considering the estimated uncertainty in these assumptions yields a range for calculated benefits: 46-128 t/d of HC, 860-2200 t/d of CO, and 60-91 t/d of NO(x). Repair of vehicles that failed an initial, official Smog Check appears to be the most important mechanism of emission reductions, but pre-inspection maintenance and repair also contributed substantially.

In Exp 1, sexually experienced or inexperienced middle-aged males showed evidence of reduced sexual arousal, with the inexperienced middleaged group demonstrating the greatest reduction. The two middle- aged groups did not differ in plasma T levels, but both had levels significantly below those of the young group. In Exp 2, spontaneous seminal emission was found to occur more often in middle-aged retired breeders than in young sexually inexperienced males. In Exp 3, the dose-response relationship of behavior and T was evaluated in groups of castrated middle-ag...", "year": 1981}, {"paperId": "54f4d2599edb57a58a4a88be6d1515ad0c33404e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2469592249", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.5b00950", "CorpusId": 9349447, "PubMed": "26207850"}, "title": "Diminishing Returns or Compounding Benefits of Air Pollution Control? The Case of NOx and Ozone.", "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nA common measure used in air quality benefit-cost assessment is marginal benefit (MB), or the monetized societal benefit of reducing 1 ton of emissions. Traditional depictions of MB for criteria air pollutants are such that each additional ton of emission reduction incurs less benefit than the previous ton. Using adjoint sensitivity analysis in a state-of-the-art air quality model, we estimate MBs for NOx emitted from mobile and point sources, characterized based on the estimated ozone-related premature mortality in the U.S.\n\n\nPOPULATION\nOur findings indicate that nation-wide emission reductions in the U.S. significantly increase NOx MBs for all sources, without exception. We estimate that MBs for NOx emitted from mobile sources increase by 1.5 and 2.5 times, on average, for 40% and 80% reductions in anthropogenic emissions across the U.S. Our results indicate a strictly concave damage function and compounding benefits of progressively lower levels of NOx emissions, providing economic incentive for higher levels of abatement than were previously advisible. These findings suggest that the traditional perception of a convex damage function and decreasing MB with abatement may not hold true for secondary pollutants such as O3.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "4376532dbac6af733d6278ae01f1de171cbf66a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2007458215", "DOI": "10.1108/14676371111148054", "CorpusId": 153662270}, "title": "Campus sustainability: climate change, transport and paper reduction", "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 This paper aims to detail the design of a campus climate change strategy, transport strategy and paper reduction strategy at the University of Technology, Sydney (Australia).Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The approach to strategy development used desktop research and staff/student consultation to inform the development of objectives, targets and actions for each strategy.
