Emissions and health savings are closely related to active forms of travel that are only realizable in areas with high levels of amenity and servicing and high levels of transit access. Their cost savings over a 50 year urban lifetime are quite modest, $19.32 million and $4.23 million for 1000 dwellings, but if these more walkable, low emission developments are pursued then the savings in transport and infrastructure for 1000 dwellings are in the order of $86 million up-front for infrastructure and $250 million for annualized transportation costs over 50 years.

The energy used and consequent carbon emissions associated with construction materials and processes are usually calculated using the concept of embodied energy, albeit with significant variations in methodology. In general, the embodied energy of a building is considered to account for less than one-fifth of its whole-life energy use.

The necessity for environmentally friendly vehicles, in conjunction with increasing concerns regarding U.S. dependency on foreign oil and climate change, has led to significant investment in enhancing the propulsion portfolio with new technologies.

PHEVs are especially appealing for short daily commutes with excessive stop-and-go driving. However, the high costs associated with their components, and in particular, with their energy storage systems have been significant barriers to extensive market penetration of PEVs. In the research reported here, we investigated the implications of motor/generator and battery size on fuel economy and GHG emissions in a medium duty PHEV. An optimization framework is proposed and applied to two different parallel powertrain configurations, pre-transmission and post-transmission, to derive the Pareto frontier with respect to motor/generator and battery size. The optimization and modeling approach adopted here facilitates better understanding of the potential benefits from proper selection of motor/generator and battery size on fuel economy and GHG emissions.

Over the 21st century, changes in CO2 levels, climate and land use are expected to alter the global distribution of vegetation, leading to changes in trace gas emissions from plants, including, importantly, the emissions of isoprene. This, combined with changes in anthropogenic emissions, has the potential to impact tropospheric ozone levels, which above a certain level are harmful to animals and vegetation. In this study we use a biogenic emissions model following the empirical parameterisation of the MEGAN model, with vegetation distributions calculated by the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM) to explore a range of potential future (2095) changes in isoprene emissions caused by changes in climate (including natural land use changes), land use, and the inhibition of isoprene emissions by CO2. From the present-day (2000) value of 467 Tg C yr\u22121, we find that the combined impact of these factors could cause a net decrease in isoprene emissions of 259 Tg C yr\u22121 (55%) with individual contributions of +78 Tg C yr\u22121 (climate change), \u2212190 Tg C yr\u22121 (land use) and \u2212147 Tg C yr\u22121 (CO2 inhibition). Using these isoprene emissions and changes in anthropogenic emissions, a series of integrations is conducted with the UM-UKCA chemistry-climate model with the aim of examining changes in ozone over the 21st century. Globally, all combined future changes cause a decrease in the tropospheric ozone burden of 27 Tg (7%) from 379 Tg in the present-day. At the surface, decreases in ozone of 6\u201310 ppb are calculated over the oceans and developed northern hemispheric regions, due to reduced NOx transport by PAN and reductions in NOx emissions in these areas respectively. Increases of 4\u20136 ppb are calculated in the continental tropics due to cropland expansion in these regions, increased CO2 inhibition of isoprene emissions, and higher temperatures due to climate change. These effects outweigh the decreases in tropical ozone caused by increased tropical isoprene emissions with climate change. Our land use change scenario consists of cropland expansion, which is most pronounced in the tropics. The tropics are also where land use change causes the greatest increases in ozone. As such there is potential for increased crop exposure to harmful levels of ozone.

In order to optimize optical quality, the effects of annealing on optical and structural properties were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. We found that the annealing temperature strongly affects both the near-band-edge (NBE) and visible (defect-related) emissions. The best characteristics have been obtained by employing annealing at 400\u00b0C in air for 2\u00a0h, bringing about a sharp and intense NBE emission. The defect-related recombinations were also suppressed effectively. However, the enhancement decreases with higher annealing temperature and prolonged annealing. PL study indicates that the NBE emission is dominated by radiative recombination associated with hydrogen donors. Thus, the enhancement of NBE is due to the activation of radiative recombinations associated with hydrogen donors. On the other hand, the reduction of visible emission is mainly attributed to the annihilation of OH groups.

Similarly, diabetics and African Americans bear disproportionate shares of the CHA and ERV benefits, respectively.

The test vehicles were carried out using a chassis dynamometer under highway cruise, transient Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), and idle operation. The after-treatment efficiently abated more than 90% of the total PAHs. Indeed, the particle-bound PAHs were reduced by >99%, and the gaseous PAHs were removed at various extents depending on the type of after-treatment and the test cycles. The PAHs in gas phase dominated the total PAH (gas + particle phases) emissions for all the test vehicles and for all cycles; that is, 99% of the two-ring and 98% of the three-ring and 97% of the four-ring and 95% of the carcinogenic PAHs were in the gas-phase after a diesel particle filter (DPF) and not bound to the very small amount of particulate matter left after a DPF. Consequently, an evaluation of the toxicity of DPF exhaust must include this volatile fraction and cannot be based on the particle fraction only. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) did not appear to promote nitration of the PAHs in general, although there might be some selective nitration of phenanthrene. Importantly the after-treatmtent reduced the equivalent B[a]P (B[a]Peq) emissions by >95%, suggesting a substantial health benefit.

We studied a panel of cell lines with a spectrum of sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. After incubation with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib for various time points, FDG uptake, glucose transport rates, and hexokinase activity were determined. FDG uptake in vivo was assessed by microPET imaging of tumor xenografts in mice. Results: In gefitinib-sensitive cell lines, there was a dramatic decrease in FDG uptake as early as 2 hours after treatment. Immunoblots showed the translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT3) from the plasma membrane to the cytosol; glucose transport rates were reduced 2.6-fold at this time. There was also a modest reduction of hexokinase activity. These metabolic alterations preceded changes in cell cycle distribution, thymidine uptake, and apoptosis. MicroPET studies showed an up to 55% decrease of tumor FDG uptake in sensitive xenografts within 48 hours. In contrast, gefitinib-resistant cells exhibited no measurable changes in FDG uptake, either in cell culture or in vivo.

The growth of Ag-doped ZnO NWs by electrodeposition at 90 \u00b0C using a chloride bath and molecular oxygen precursor is reported. Ag acts as an electrocatalyst for the deposition and influences the nucleation and growth of the structures. The silver atomic concentration in the wires is controlled by the additive concentration in the deposition bath and a content up to 3.7 atomic % is reported. XRD analysis shows that the integration of silver enlarges the lattice parameters of ZnO. The optical measurements also show that the direct optical bandgap of ZnO is reduced by silver doping. The bandgap shift and lattice expansion are explained by first principle calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) on the silver impurity integration as an interstitial (Ag(i)) and as a substitute of zinc atom (Ag(Zn)) in the crystal lattice. They notably indicate that Ag(Zn) doping forms an impurity band because of Ag 4d and O 2p orbital interactions, shifting the Fermi level toward the valence band.

This concern is most often focused on the encroachment of artificial light into previously unlit areas of the night\u2010time environment, but changes in the spectral composition, duration and spatial pattern of light are also recognized as having ecological effects. Here, we examine the potential consequences for organisms of five management options to reduce night\u2010time light pollution. These are to (i) prevent areas from being artificially lit; (ii) limit the duration of lighting; (iii) reduce the \u2018trespass\u2019 of lighting into areas that are not intended to be lit (including the night sky); (iv) change the intensity of lighting; and (v) change the spectral composition of lighting. Maintaining and increasing natural unlit areas is likely to be the most effective option for reducing the ecological effects of lighting. However, this will often conflict with other social and economic objectives. Decreasing the duration of lighting will reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, but is unlikely to alleviate many impacts on nocturnal and crepuscular animals, as peak times of demand for lighting frequently coincide with those in the activities of these species. Reducing the trespass of lighting will maintain heterogeneity even in otherwise well\u2010lit areas, providing dark refuges that mobile animals can exploit. Decreasing the intensity of lighting will reduce energy consumption and limit both skyglow and the area impacted by high\u2010intensity direct light. Shifts towards \u2018whiter\u2019 light are likely to increase the potential range of environmental impacts as light is emitted across a broader range of wavelengths. Synthesis and applications. The artificial lightscape will change considerably over coming decades with the drive for more cost\u2010effective low\u2010carbon street lighting solutions and growth in the artificially lit area. Developing lighting strategies that minimize adverse ecological impacts while balancing the often conflicting requirements of light for human utility, comfort and safety, aesthetic concerns, energy consumption and carbon emission reduction constitute significant future challenges. However, as both lighting technology and understanding of its ecological effects develop, there is potential to identify adaptive solutions that resolve these conflicts.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "e4bf58512a4dea79941b0c2ee62549a4cdbdcc4a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117277615", "DOI": "10.1109/ACC.1998.707039", "CorpusId": 111086989}, "title": "Issues in cold start emission control for automotive IC engines", "abstract": "We consider the problem of reducing unburned tailpipe hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for internal combustion engines during the \"cold start\" period.

We simulate which policy measures could induce an almost complete decarbonisation of residential heating, the by far largest source of direct emissions in residential buildings. Under which assumptions is it possible, and how long would it take? We use the non-equilibrium bottom-up model FTT:Heat to simulate policies for a transition towards low-carbon heating in a context of inertia and bounded rationality, focusing on the uptake of heating systems. Our results indicate that the near-zero decarbonisation is achievable by 2050, but requires substantial policy efforts. We find that policy mixes are more effective for incentivising the uptake of fuel-efficient low-carbon technologies, compared to a residential carbon tax as the only policy. In combination with subsidies and procurement policies for renewables, near-complete decarbonisation could be achieved with a tax of 50\u2013200\u00a0\u20ac/tCO2. Without being complimented by additional policies, carbon taxes show a decreasing marginal impact on total emission reductions, thus remaining insufficient for deep decarbonisation. In all scenarios, the decarbonisation of heating would increase projected heating costs faced by households initially, but could lead to cost reductions in most world regions in the medium term.

These problems are particularly pronounced in the USA, which currently consumes c. 27% of global oil production and produces c. 25% of global carbon emissions, and where c. 65% of adults are overweight or obese. Other countries throughout the world that replicate or hope to replicate the automobile-based lifestyle of the USA face similar problems now or in the near future. This paper develops and applies calculations relating the distances that could be travelled through recommended daily walking or cycling with weight loss, oil consumption and carbon emissions. These straightforward calculations demonstrate that widespread substitution of driving with distances travelled during recommended daily exercise could reduce the USA's oil consumption by up to 38%. This saving far exceeds the amount of oil recoverable from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, suggesting that exercise can reduce foreign oil dependence and provide an alternative to oil extraction from environmentally sensitive habitat. At the same time, an average individual who substitutes this amount of exercise for transportation would burn respectively c. 12.2 and 26.0 kg of fat per year for walking and cycling. This is sufficient to eliminate obese and overweight conditions in a few years without dangerous or draconian diet plans. Furthermore, a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of c. 35% is possible if the revenue saved through decreased health care spending on obesity is redirected toward carbon abatement. As a result, exercise-based transportation may constitute a favourable alternative to the energy and diet plans that are currently being implemented in the USA and may offer better development choices for developing countries.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "ca58650128202ed6d5624be1f24bd2aac03ef661", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170945924", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1656835", "CorpusId": 97939060}, "title": "Radiative Pair Transitions in p\u2010Type ZnSe: Cu Crystals", "abstract": "Shallow levels with an ionization energy of 0.012 eV play an important role in the photoelectronic properties of p\u2010type ZnSe:Cu crystals.

Also, tone perception per se was unaffected, as revealed by determination of auditory thresholds through auditory brainstem responses and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. TRPV1-KO showed also less contextual fear if assessed 1 d or 1 month after strong conditioning protocols.

Comparison with metabolic activity by positron emission tomography.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nStress thallium scintigraphy provides important diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with coronary artery disease by demonstrating regional myocardial ischemia. However, if the clinical question being addressed is whether a region is viable and not whether there is inducible ischemia, then it may be more reasonable to perform rest-redistribution imaging rather than stress-redistribution imaging followed by either reinjection or late redistribution. Therefore, we determined whether stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution imaging provide the same information regarding myocardial viability.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nBoth stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution thallium single photon emission computed tomographic imaging was performed in 41 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease, with quantitative analysis of regional thallium activity. Thallium reinjection was performed immediately after the 3- to 4-hour redistribution images were completed. Of the 155 myocardial regions with perfusion defects on the stress images, 91 (59%) were irreversible on conventional 3- to 4-hour redistribution images. When the outcomes of these irreversible regions were assessed after reinjection and compared with rest-redistribution images, there was concordance of data regarding myocardial viability (normal/reversible or irreversible) in 72 of the 91 (79%) irreversible defects. Twenty of the 41 patients also underwent positron emission tomography at rest with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [15O]water. In these patients, stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution imaging provided concordant information regarding myocardial viability in 427 (72%) of 594 myocardial regions and discordance in 167 regions. However, when irreversible thallium defects were further analyzed according to the severity of the thallium defect in these discordant regions, 149 of 167 (89%) demonstrated only mild-to-moderate reduction in thallium activity (51% to 85% of normal activity), and positron emission tomography verified 98% of these regions to be metabolically active and viable. Thus, when the severity of thallium activity was considered within irreversible thallium defects, the concordance between stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution imaging regarding myocardial viability increased to 94%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate that one of two imaging modalities, either stress-redistribution-reinjection or rest-redistribution imaging, may be used for identifying viable myocardium. However, if there are no contraindications to stress testing, stress-redistribution-reinjection imaging provides a more comprehensive assessment of the extent and severity of coronary artery disease by demonstrating regional myocardial ischemia without jeopardizing information on myocardial viability.", "year": 1993}, {"paperId": "8387db4ea37ca4287519d05863aa75514d86e809", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2045467921", "DOI": "10.3390/CHALLE3020290", "CorpusId": 53706730}, "title": "Challenges in Improving Energy Efficiency in a University Campus Through the Application of Persuasive Technology and Smart Sensors", "abstract": "The impact of energy consumption and carbon emission in the UK poses a grave challenge. This challenge is particularly high amongst residents of university campuses, where usage of electricity and carbon emission remain invisible to the students. In student residential accommodation, personal choices and social influences affect electricity consumption and ultimately the resultant reduction in carbon emissions. Therefore, innovative solutions are required to change students\u2019 energy consumption behavior, and one promising part of the solution is to present real-time electricity consumption data to students in real-time via a dedicated web platform, while, at the same time, appointing an energy delegate in each hall to induce motivation among the students.

However, the situation is different; with the complexity in behavior of our target groups \u201cthe students who are living in the halls of residence\u201d, there are economical and environmental aspects to be addressed in these issues, in the campus halls of residence. Therefore, we propose a system to address this issue, by applying smart sensors (real-time electricity data capture), integration of dedicated visual web interface (real-time electricity feedback display) and an appointed energy delegate in each hall (a motivator). It is expected that this will motivate students living in the halls of residence to reduce their electricity wastage and, therefore, control the energy cost and also reduce the carbon emissions released into the environment.

The analysis applies the China Regional Energy Model, a multisector, static, global, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model representing 30 individual provinces with physical accounts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The structure of road and nonroad freight (and passenger) sectors, the preparation of transport activity data, and a policy similar to announced goals that specify a 17% reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions intensity of gross domestic product are described. In the national aggregate and in most provinces, the road freight sector is most affected by the emissions intensity cap. The road freight sector contributes 24%\u2013-versus 18% from nonroad freight and 51% from nontransport sectors\u2013-of a 5.1% reduction in national refined oil demand. Significant regional differences are found in the impacts of a national-level, economywide policy. Steep reductions in freight activity occur in some of the poorest provinces, partly because they offer low-cost abatement opportunities, and the resulting adjustments across the economy affect transport demand. This research contributes a new tool capable of capturing the transport impact of sector- and province-specific policies in detail and providing a rigorous foundation for future dynamic CGE analyses.

To be effective, a climate agreement must cause substantial emissions reductions either directly (in the agreement's own lifetime) or indirectly (by paving the way for a future agreement that causes substantial emissions reductions directly). To reduce global emissions substantially, an agreement must satisfy three conditions. Firstly, participation must be both comprehensive and stable. Secondly, participating countries must accept deep commitments. Finally, the agreement must obtain high compliance rates. We argue that three types of enforcement will be crucial to fulfilling these three conditions: (1) incentives for countries to ratify with deep commitments, (2) incentives for countries that have ratified with deep commitments to abstain from withdrawal, and (3) incentives for countries having ratified with deep commitments to comply with them. Based on assessing the constraints that characterize the climate change negotiations, we contend that adopting such three-fold potent enforcement will likely be politically infeasible, not only within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but also in the framework of a more gradual approach.

The Swedish case is of interest since Sweden has pursued an ambitious policy to combat the precursors of acid rain. Between 1989 and 1995, about 59 percent of the reduction in sulfur emissions from manufacturing can be attributed to the announcement and implementation of a Swedish sulfur tax.

In addition, a total audit of energy consumption was undertaken. It involved an assessment of materials, construction, and the repair and maintenance of forestry machines as well as the costs associated with an energy-conversion plant.

Performance on a widely used test of decision\u2010making, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), can discriminate controls from persons with ventral medial frontal lesions, substance\u2010dependence, and pathological gambling. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies indicate that substance\u2010dependent individuals show altered prefrontal activity on the task. Here we adapted the IGT to an fMRI setting to test the hypothesis that defects in ventral medial and prefrontal processing are associated with impaired decisions that involve risk but may differ depending on whether substance dependence is comorbid with gambling problems. Method: 18 controls, 14 substance\u2010dependent individuals (SD), and 16 SD with gambling problems (SDPG) underwent fMRI while performing a modified version of the IGT. Result: Group differences were observed in ventral medial frontal, right frontopolar, and superior frontal cortex during decision\u2010making. Controls showed the greatest activity, followed by SDPG, followed by SD. Conclusion: Our results support a hypothesis that defects in ventral medial frontal processing lead to impaired decisions that involve risk. Reductions in right prefrontal activity during decision\u2010making appear to be modulated by the presence of gambling problems and may reflect impaired working memory, stimulus reward valuation, or cue reactivity in substance\u2010dependent individuals.

While the location of GHG reductions does not affect their climate benefits, it can impact human health benefits associated with co-emitted pollutants. Here, an advanced modeling framework is used to explore how subnational level GHG targets influence air pollutant co-benefits from ground level ozone and fine particulate matter. Two carbon policy scenarios are analyzed, each reducing the same total amount of GHG emissions in the Northeast US: an economy-wide Cap and Trade (CAT) program reducing emissions from all sectors of the economy, and a Clean Energy Standard (CES) reducing emissions from the electricity sector only. Results suggest that a regional CES policy will cost about 10 times more than a CAT policy. Despite having the same regional targets in the Northeast, carbon leakage to non-capped regions varies between policies. Consequently, a regional CAT policy will result in national carbon reductions that are over six times greater than the carbon reduced by the CES in 2030. Monetized regional human health benefits of the CAT and CES policies are 844% and 185% of the costs of each policy, respectively. Benefits for both policies are thus estimated to exceed their costs in the Northeast US. The estimated value of human health co-benefits associated with air pollution reductions for the CES scenario is two times that of the CAT scenario. Implications: In this research, an advanced modeling framework is used to determine the potential impacts of regional carbon policies on air pollution co-benefits associated with ground level ozone and fine particulate matter. Study results show that spatially heterogeneous GHG policies have the potential to create areas of air pollution dis-benefit. It is also shown that monetized human health benefits within the area covered by policy may be larger than the model estimated cost of the policy. These findings are of particular interest both as U.S. states work to develop plans to meet state-level carbon emissions reduction targets set by the EPA through the Clean Power Plan, and in the absence of comprehensive national carbon policy.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "82f36edee4da18b13411e451d2432d75d291583f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117542999", "DOI": "10.1177/0047287512461568", "CorpusId": 154523425}, "title": "Economic Impacts of a Carbon Tax on the Australian Tourism Industry", "abstract": "The article assesses the potential economic effects on the Australian tourism industry from the introduction of a carbon tax introduced July 1, 2012.

Although these benefits are substantial, any implementation strategy needs to consider cost-effectiveness. In the present study, only 10% of vehicles\u2014contributing 22% of the total vehicle emissions\u2014failed the idle CO standard.

BACKGROUND Delhi and other major Indian cities are among the most polluted cities in the world. Vehicles, which contribute ~20% of total CO2 emissions in India, are a major source of urban air pollution and its related health impacts. The annual averages of suspended PM concentrations in 1997 were recorded as 295 \u03bcg/m3 in residential areas and 400 \u03bcg/m3 in commercial areas.1 They are higher than the Central Pollution Control Board limit of 150 \u03bcg/m3 and much higher than the World Health Organization guidelines of 60\u201390 \u03bcg/m3. Two-wheeler vehicles, which account for ~70% of the total vehicle fleet, are responsible for a significant portion of the total vehicle emissions and petroleum consumption. It is estimated that, of the total annual vehicular emissions in Delhi, two-wheeler vehicles contribute 6% of the CO2, 27% of the CO, 21% of the PM, and 47% of the HC.1 Emissions from in-use private vehicles are a pollution problem caused by a very large number of small sources. Recent, strengthened emission standards for new vehicles, such as Euro I and Euro II, and court edicts on fuels and various commercial vehicles will have some beneficial impact on air quality, but India\u2019s current efforts to control emissions from the in-use vehicle fleet are not as strong or effective as they could be. The subject of emission control of in-use vehicles has been largely untouched in India to date, except for some pockets of action by a few individuals, companies, or groups. A comprehensive approach to vehicular air pollution encompasses factors such as vehicular technology, fuel quality, vehicular maintenance, and traffic planning.

With only 10% of vehicles failing Delhi\u2019s CO standard, cost-effectiveness is a concern for any I/M strategy. Data indicate that targeting older vehicles for inspection may not be appropriate.

Supplying oxygen-nanobubbles (NBs) to continuously flooded paddy soil may retard the development of reductive conditions, thereby reducing the emission of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, and dissolution of arsenic, an environmental load. We tested this hypothesis by performing a pot experiment and measuring redox-related variables. The NBs were introduced into control water (with properties similar to those of river water) using a commercially available generator. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) growth did not differ between plants irrigated with NB water and those irrigated with control water, but NB water significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cumulative CH4 emission during the rice-growing season by 21%. The amounts of iron, manganese, and arsenic that leached into the drainage water before full rice heading were also reduced by the NB water. Regardless of the water type, weekly-measured CH4 flux was linearly correlated with the leached iron concentration during the rice-growing season (r = 0.74, p < 0.001). At the end of the experiment, the NB water significantly lowered the soil pH in the 0\u20135 cm layer, probably because of the raised redox potential. The population of methanogenic Archaea (mcrA copy number) in the 0\u20135 cm layer was significantly increased by the NB water, but we found no correlation between the mcrA copy number and the cumulative CH4 emission (r = \u20130.08, p = 0.85). In pots without rice plants, soil reduction was not enhanced, regardless of the water type.

One can foresee that China can hardly escapeanemissioncapinthefutureasitseconomicdevelopment and citizens\u2019 lifestyles continue to mimic consumption and production patterns of developed countries but with much lower energy intensity levels. However, China would need some time to prepare for the day to come. China committed itself to reduce energy intensity by 20% from 2005 to 2010 in its 11th Five Year Plan (3) and, prior to Copenhagen, has extended its commitment to 40-45% of carbon intensity reduction by 2020 partly achieved through its rapid increase in electricity generation capacities from low-carbon energy sources (e.g., China has doubled installed capacity for wind power annually since 2005). However, China failed to reduce its energy intensity since 2005, but instead had to admit to an increase of 4% prior to 2009, which casts severe doubts on the announced 20% reduction by the end of this year and increases the challenge to achieve the 2020 target. One of the key reasons is that there is no effective market-oriented mechanism in place given the great economic and technological disparities it has within the country. Although the country is not likely to agree to a reduction target in post-2012, a domestic emission \u201ccap and trade\u201d scheme implemented between Chinese regions could potentially help improve energy intensity in all regions and thus lead to an effective reduction of emissions in rich areas and increase efficiency levels for the poor. Furthermore, after \u201cpracticing\u201d such an emission trading scheme at the domestic level, China will be familiar with the mechanism and prepared to join an international carbon trade market in the future. The relative wealthier regions in China such as the coastal provinces usually possess relative advanced production technologies and could effectively be linked with emission caps and trade emission permits with the less developed regions such as the western provinces via a domestic \u201cClean Development Mechanism (CDM)\u201d. This mechanism would stimulate green business investments in the field of wind farms and carbon capture and storage power plants as they would gain extra support in financial and technological terms. Further, it can also accelerate the increase of Chinese research and development investments in low-carbon technologies. While Eastern Chinabecomesasourceofinnovation,WesternChinacanprovide a vast market to absorb and consume such technologies. There were clear signals in Copenhagen that China is seen as less deserving of financial and technological aid from international channels as in the past and more resources should rather be made available for the least developed countries. Hence, within China, the wealthier regions are responsible and capable to play a leading role inhelpingthelessdevelopedregions to leapfrog from a carbon-intensive development path (4). And finally, such a \u201ccap and trade\u201d scheme could potentially help the country in easing off regional economic disparities as well as accelerating the transition to a green economy. Western provinceswouldreceivefinancialandtechnologicalaidtoimprove their economic conditions compared to the richer coastal areas. Such an emission trading scheme between Chinese regions in a post Kyoto world would be very much in line with China\u2019s international manner of \u201c..common, but differentiated responsibilities...\u201d and would provide a \u201cwin-win\u201d strategy in collaboratively tackling climate change (5).", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "541a504630f87065e51982cb8ef914a2ce46f336", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2298381352", "CorpusId": 110472970}, "title": "ENERGY EFFICIENCY/RENEWABLE ENERGY IMPACT IN THE TEXAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN (TERP) PRELIMINARY REPORT: INTEGRATED NOX EMISSIONS SAVINGS FROM EE/RE PROGRAMS STATEWIDE Annual Report to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality January 2008 - December 2008", "abstract": "The Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP), established by the 77th Texas Legislature with the enactment of Senate Bill 5 (SB 5), states that energy efficiency and renewable energy (EE/RE) measures are needed to meet the minimum federal air quality standards.

Because coffee plantations have a lifespan of about thirty years, the likely effects of future climates are already a concern. Forward-looking research on adaptation is therefore in high demand across the entire supply chain. In this paper we seek to project current and future climate suitability for coffee production (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora) on a global scale. We used machine learning algorithms to derive functions of climatic suitability from a database of geo-referenced production locations. Use of several parameter combinations enhances the robustness of our analysis. The resulting multi-model ensemble suggests that higher temperatures may reduce yields of C. arabica, while C. canephora could suffer from increasing variability of intra-seasonal temperatures. Climate change will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50\u00a0% across emission scenarios. Impacts are highest at low latitudes and low altitudes. Impacts at higher altitudes and higher latitudes are still negative but less pronounced. The world\u2019s dominant production regions in Brazil and Vietnam may experience substantial reductions in area available for coffee.

A systematic intercomparison with ENSEMBLES RCMs is carried out, such that in total information is provided for an unprecedentedly large data set of 100 RCM simulations. An evaluation finds very reasonable skill for the EURO\u2010CORDEX models in simulating temporal and geographical variations of (mean and heavy) precipitation at both horizontal resolutions. Heavy and extreme precipitation events are projected to intensify across most of Europe throughout the whole year. All considered models agree on a distinct intensification of extremes by often more than +20% in winter and fall and over central and northern Europe. A reduction of rainy days and mean precipitation in summer is simulated by a large majority of models in the Mediterranean area, but intermodel spread between the simulations is large. In central Europe and France during summer, models project decreases in precipitation but more intense heavy and extreme rainfalls. Comparison to previous RCM projections from ENSEMBLES reveals consistency but slight differences in summer, where reductions in southern European precipitation are not as pronounced as previously projected.

These bacteria share the unique ability of using methane as a sole carbon and energy source and have been found in a great variety of habitats. Phylogenetically, known methanotrophs constitute a rather limited group and have so far only been affiliated with the Proteobacteria. Here, we report the isolation and initial characterization of a nonproteobacterial obligately methanotrophic bacterium. The isolate, designated Kam1, was recovered from an acidic hot spring in Kamchatka, Russia, and is more thermoacidophilic than any other known methanotroph, with optimal growth at \u224855\u00b0C and pH 3.5. Kam1 is only distantly related to all previously known methanotrophs and belongs to the Verrucomicrobia lineage of evolution. Genes for methane monooxygenases, essential for initiation of methane oxidation, could not be detected by using standard primers in PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis, suggesting the presence of a different methane oxidation enzyme. Kam1 also lacks the well developed intracellular membrane systems typical for other methanotrophs. The isolate represents a previously unrecognized biological methane sink, and, due to its unusual phylogenetic affiliation, it will shed important light on the origin, evolution, and diversity of biological methane oxidation and on the adaptation of this process to extreme habitats.

In the UK we have a formal target for the reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 80 per cent by 2050 (on 1990 levels). Official publications regularly suggest that reducing overall energy demand is an important part of meeting that target. Indeed, in a recent report of the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC, 2009, p. 22), it was suggested that residential energy efficiency measures could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tonnes per annum (or around 10 per cent of the UK's current total emissions) by 2022. The UK is not alone: many other countries have targets and aspirations for the reduction of energy consumption. Meanwhile, the future of energy demand will increasingly be synonymous with the future of electricity demand if the heat and transport sectors are electrified over the coming decades. Decarbonization of the energy sector is not just about reducing energy demand. Emissions from direct combustion of heat and direct combustion of liquid fuel in vehicles are roughly equal to emissions from power stations. Reducing emissions from electricity production is technically feasible via a combination of renewables, nuclear power and carbon-capture-and-storage equipment. This implies that switching heating and transportation demand for energy from combustion of fossil fuels to heat from electricity (or combined heat and power) and to electric vehicles is important in reducing emissions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "40af9b80b86bc1d5e54ea590d6ea61ca8c27c162", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2328248670", "DOI": "10.3390/SU8040336", "CorpusId": 11179677}, "title": "Measuring the Total-Factor Carbon Emission Performance of Industrial Land Use in China Based on the Global Directional Distance Function and Non-Radial Luenberger Productivity Index", "abstract": "Industry is a major contributor to carbon emissions in China, and industrial land is an important input to industrial production. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the carbon emission performance of industrial land use is necessary for making reasonable carbon reduction policies that promote the sustainable use of industrial land. This paper aims to analyze the dynamic changes in the total-factor carbon emission performance of industrial land use (TCPIL) in China by applying a global directional distance function (DDF) and non-radial Luenberger productivity index. The empirical results show that the eastern region enjoys better TCPIL than the central and western regions, but the regional gaps in TCPIL are narrowing. The growth in NLCPILs (non-radial Luenberger carbon emission performance of industrial land use) in the eastern and central regions is mainly driven by technological progress, whereas efficiency improvements contribute more to the growth of NLCPIL in the western region. The provinces in the eastern region have the most innovative and environmentally-friendly production technologies. The results of the analysis of the influencing factors show implications for improving the NLCPIL, including more investment in industrial research and development (R&D), the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies, reduction in the use of fossil energy, especially coal, in the process of industrial production, actively learning about foreign advanced technology, properly solving the problem of surplus labor in industry and the expansion of industrial development.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "37980cf73525a769a5135ad690dfd13c050da618", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2103208721", "DOI": "10.2514/1.C032660", "CorpusId": 110845794}, "title": "Hybrid-Electric Propulsion for Aircraft", "abstract": "Against a background of increasing energy demand and rising fuel prices, hybrid-electric propulsion systems have the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption in the aviation industry, particularly in the lighter sectors.
