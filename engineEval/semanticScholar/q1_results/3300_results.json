It pursues three core programs: the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources (SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey (SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data, improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13 provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes the location and format of the data and provides references to important technical papers. The SDSS web site, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures.

However, when (even limited) information is provided on the role of CO 2 storage in reducing CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere, opinion shifts towards expressing slight support for the concept. Support depends, however, upon concern about human-caused climate change, plus recognition of the need for major reductions in CO 2 emissions. It also depends upon CCS being seen as just one part of a wider strategy for achieving significant cuts in CO 2 emissions. A portfolio including renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and lifestyle change to reduce demand was generally favoured. CCS can be part of such a portfolio, but wind, wave, tidal, solar and energy efficiency were preferred. It was felt that uncertainties concerning the potential risks of CCS had to be better addressed and reduced; in particular the risks of accidents and leakage (including the potential environmental, ecosystem and human health impacts which might result from leakage).", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "41f04fe7ed7cdb815da9bcdd90663b90754be20d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2949908344", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.229260", "CorpusId": 153068852}, "title": "Technology Diffusion and the Stability of Climate Coalitions", "abstract": "Free-riding is a major problem for international climate policy. A country can take advantage of other countries' emission reduction without contributing to abatement policies itself. Game theory suggests that issue linkage may help to overcome free-riding. Earlier studies suggest that if negotiations on greenhouse gas emission reduction are coupled to negotiation on technology transfer, the incentives to co-operate increase. This study confirms that finding. A country has less reason to free-ride if free-riding implies that the countries loses access to desirable, foreign technologies. We also show that, in many cases, it hurts to deny another country access to domestic technologies, if that country retaliates by withholding its technologies. We further show that the losses of withholding abatement technologies are small relative to the gains of free-riding.

The climate response depends not only upon the TOA forcing, but its difference with respect to the surface value, which represents radiative heating within the atmosphere. Surface forcing alters evaporation and the hydrologic cycle, which feeds back upon the aerosol burden through the efficiency of wet deposition. We calculate the surface forcing by soil dust aerosols and its global sensitivity by varying aspects of the dust distribution that are poorly constrained by observations. Ignorance of the global dust burden corresponds to a forcing uncertainty of over a factor of two, with smaller uncertainties due to imprecise knowledge of particle optical properties and the particle size distribution. While global evaporation and precipitation are reduced in response to surface radiative forcing by dust, precipitation increases locally over desert regions, so that dust emission can act as a negative feedback to desertification. The effect of the global reduction in precipitation is to lengthen the particle lifetime by reducing the efficiency of wet deposition, representing a positive feedback upon the global dust burden. For the current climate, we calculate the reduction in wet deposition by dust radiative forcing and find that the aerosol burden is increased only modestly. However, the global dust burden and associated radiative forcing are substantially higher during glacial climates, so that the amplification of the dust load by this feedback is larger. By extrapolating from its radiative forcing in the current climate, we estimate that dust reduces precipitation during glacial times by as much as half the reduction due to the colder climate alone.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "4cccc1f7f68e1f49cae297376abc2fbbccbe2858", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2133339723", "DOI": "10.1029/2007JG000501", "CorpusId": 3121466}, "title": "Suppression of rice methane emission by sulfate deposition in simulated acid rain", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0Sulfate in acid rain is known to suppress methane (CH4) emissions from natural freshwater wetlands. Here we examine the possibility that CH4 emissions from rice agriculture may be similarly affected by acid rain, a major and increasing pollution problem in Asia. Our findings suggest that acid rain rates of SO42\u2212 deposition may help to reduce CH4 emissions from rice agriculture. Emissions from rice plants treated with simulated acid rain at levels of SO42\u2212 consistent with the range of deposition in Asia were reduced by 24% during the grain filling and ripening stage of the rice season which accounts for 50% of the overall CH4 that is normally emitted in a rice season. A single application of SO42\u2212 at a comparable level reduced CH4 emission by 43%. We hypothesize that the reduction in CH4 emission may be due to a combination of effects. The first mechanism is that the low rates of SO42\u2212 may be sufficient to boost yields of rice and, in so doing, may cause a reduction in root exudates to the rhizosphere, a key substrate source for methanogenesis. Decreasing a major substrate source for methanogens is also likely to intensify competition with sulfate-reducing microorganisms for whom prior SO42\u2212 limitation had been lifted by the simulated acid rain S deposition.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "077961faf1b9d40340d6442b1dcb4c12f114792d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1023/B:ENVI.0000003638.42750.36", "CorpusId": 153968705}, "title": "Energy Use and CO2 Production in Tropical Agriculture and Means and Strategies for Reduction or Mitigation", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide emissions due to fossil fuel consumption are well recognized as a major contributor to climate change. In the debate on dealing with this threat, expectations are high that agriculture based economies of the developing world can help alleviate this problem. But, the contribution of agricultural operations to these emissions is fairly small. It is the clearing of native ecosystems for agricultural use in the tropics that is the largest non-fossil fuel source of CO2 input to the atmosphere.Our calculation show that the use of fossil energy and the concomitant emission of CO2 in the agricultural operational sector - i.e. the use of farm machinery, irrigation, fertilization and chemical pesticides - amounts to merely 3.9% of the commercial energy use in that part of the world. Of this, 70% is associated with the production and use of chemical fertilizers. In the absence of fertilizer use, the developing world would have converted even more land for cultivation, most of which is completely unsuitable for cultivation. Current expectations are that reforestation in these countries can sequester large quantities of carbon in order to mitigate excessive emissions elsewhere. But, any program that aims to set aside land for the purpose of sequestering carbon must do so without threatening food security in the region. The sole option to liberate the necessary land for carbon sequestration would be the intensification of agricultural production on some of the better lands by increased fertilizer inputs.As our calculations show, the sequestration of carbon far outweighs the emissions that are associated with the production of the extra fertilizer needed. Increasing the fertilizer use in the developing world (without China) by 20%, we calculated an overall net benefit in the carbon budget of between 80 and 206 Mt yr\u22121 dependent on the carbon sequestration rate assumed for the regrowing forest. In those regions, where current fertilizer use is low, the relative benefits are the highest as responding yield increases are highest and thus more land can be set aside without harming food security. In Sub-Saharan Africa a 20% fertilizer increase, which amounts to 0.14 Mt of extra fertilizer, can tie up somewhere between 8 and 19 Mt of CO2 per year (average: 96 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In the Near East and North Africa with a 20%-increased fertilizer use of 0.4 Mt yr-1 between 10 and 24 Mt of CO2 could be sequestered on the land set aside (40 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In South Asia this is 22\u201361 Mt CO2 yr\u22121 with an annual additional input of 2.15 Mt fertilizer (19 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer).In fact, carbon credits may be the only way for some of the farmers in these regions to afford the costly inputs. Additionally, in regions with already relatively high fertilizer inputs such as in South Asia, an efficient use of the extra fertilizer must be warranted.Nevertheless, the net CO2 benefit through implementation of this measure in the developing world is insignificant compared to the worldwide CO2 output by human activity. Thus, reforestation is only one mitigating measure and not the solution to unconstrained fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Carbon emissions should, therefore, first of all be reduced by the avoidance of deforestation in the developing world and moreover by higher energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "e539945ef0c851ad7a740a4ead93190c56ade285", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2316509377", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.60.5.568", "CorpusId": 29522071, "PubMed": "20480856"}, "title": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions from U.S. Institutions of Higher Education", "abstract": "Abstract Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission estimates from signatories of the American College and University Presidents\u2019 Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) were compared across Carnegie institutional classifications.

This paper aims to introduce a simple stochastic model that allows the robustness of economic mechanisms for emission reduction under multiple natural and human-related uncertainties to be analyzed. Unlike standard equilibrium state analysis, the model shows that the explicit introduction of uncertainties regarding emissions, abatement costs, and equilibrium states makes it almost impossible for existing market-based trading and carbon taxes to be environmentally safe and cost-effective. Here we propose a computerized multi-agent trading model. This can be viewed as a prototype to simulate an emission trading market that is regulated in a decentralized way.

These asymmetries were quantified in normal human ears, and compared to the corresponding asymmetries apparent in data from animal models. Recent studies have demonstrated that the reduction of DPOAE amplitude by cochlear trauma is greater when L1 > L2 than when L1 = L2, suggesting that the reduction of DPOAEs by trauma demonstrates an asymmetry in L1,L2 space that is qualitatively similar to that of normative DPOAE amplitude. To investigate this issue, 2f1-f2 DPOAE amplitudes were measured over a wide range of L1 and L2 in rabbit ears pre- and postinjection of the ototoxic loop-diuretic ethacrynic acid. The results indicate that the asymmetry in L1,L2 space of the reduction of DPOAEs by trauma is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the asymmetry in L1,L2 space of normative DPOAE amplitude. Specifically, the L1 values that maximized normative DPOAE amplitudes for any specified L2 (or, equivalently, the L1 values that allowed L2 to be minimized for any specified normative DPOAE amplitude) also yielded the greatest reduction of DPOAEs by the diuretic. In humans, the L1 values that maximize normative DPOAE amplitudes for any specified L2 are well approximated by a simple equation, with parameters that vary with frequency and f2/f1. It is suggested that the L1,L2 values defined by this equation may be optimum for use in clinical applications.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "ff40b21f76e24431f07f919ffb45363d00f44ab9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2040086905", "DOI": "10.1021/ES010705G", "CorpusId": 20477354, "PubMed": "11944662"}, "title": "Livestock ammonia management and particulate-related health benefits.", "abstract": "Agricultural operations are the largest source of ammonia emissions in the United States and contribute to the formation of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, two prevalent forms of fine particulate matter.

The effects of this trend on tropical forest canopy dynamics, emissions of greenhouse gases, and other ecological functions are potentially large but poorly understood. We established a throughfall exclusion experiment in an east-central Amazon forest (Tapajos National Forest, Brazil) to help understand these effects. After 1-year intercalibration period of two 1-ha forest plots, we installed plastic panels and wooden gutters in the understory of one of the plots, thereby excluding \ufffd 890 mm of throughfall during the exclusion period of 2000 (late January to early August) and \ufffd 680 mm thus far in the exclusion period of 2001 (early January to late May). Average daily throughfall reaching the soil during the exclusion period in 2000 was 4.9 and 8.3 mm in the treatment and control plots and was 4.8 and 8.1 mm in 2001, respectively. During the first exclusion period, surface soil water content (0-2 m) declined by \ufffd 100 mm, while deep soil water (2-11 m) was unaffected. During the second exclusion period, which began shortly after the dry season when soil water content was low, surface and deep soil water content declined by \ufffd 140 and 160 mm, respectively. Although this depletion of soil water provoked no detectable increase in leaf drought stress (i.e., no reduction in predawn leaf water potential), photosynthetic capacity declined for some species, the canopy thinned (greater canopy openness and lower leaf area index) during the second exclusion period, stem radial growth of trees <15 m tall declined, and fine litterfall declined in the treatment plot, as did tree fruiting. Aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) (stemwood increment and fine litter production) declined by one fourth, from 15.1 to 11.4 Mg ha \ufffd 1 yr \ufffd 1 , in the treatment plot and decreased slightly, from 11.9 to 11.5 Mg ha \ufffd 1 yr \ufffd 1 , in the control plot. Stem respiration varied seasonally and was correlated with stem radial growth but showed no treatment response. The fastest response to the throughfall exclusion, and the surface soil moisture deficits that it provoked, was found in the soil itself. The treatment reduced N2O emissions and increased CH4 consumption relative to the control plot, presumably in response to the improved soil aeration that is associated with soil drying. Our hypothesis that NO emissions would increase following exclusion was not supported. The conductivity and alkalinity of water percolating through the litter layer and through the mineral soil to a depth of 200 cm was higher in the treatment plot, perhaps because of the lower volume of water that was moving through these soil layers in this plot. Decomposition of the litter showed no difference between plots.

Potential benefits include reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides and development of biomass energy markets.

The model is first used to evaluate the plant-level economics of cofiring as a function of biomass cost. It is then integrated with state-specific coal consumption and biomass supply estimates to develop national supply curves for cofire electricity and carbon mitigation. A delivered cost of biomass below $15 per ton is required for cofire to be competitive with existing coal-based generation. Except at low biomass prices (less than $15 per ton), cofiring is unlikely to be competitive for NOx or SOx control, but it can provide comparatively inexpensive control of CO2 emissions: we estimate that emissions reductions of 100 Mt-CO2/year (a 5% reduction in electric-sector emissions) can be achieved at 25 ( 20 $/tC.

The purposes of this paper are to 1) propose a method for formulating national sectoral baselines and crediting targets for the electricity sector for post-2012; 2) assess the amount of emissions that could be reduced compared to the baselines by seven developing countries with large CO2 emissions from electricity generation based on options of increased efficiency fossil power plant and decreased share of fossil electricity and 3) estimate the amount of emissions reduction credits that could be generated based on the proposed targets. The national electricity sector crediting baseline from 2005-2020 for each country is set as a linear line starting from the average emission intensity in year 2005 of all power plants (average operating margin in 2005) to a weighted average emission intensity of the current average operating margin and the most recent capacity additions comprising 20 percent of the total generation (build margin). Two crediting targets are proposed: Dynamic targets are formulated the same way as the baselines but with a different weighting factor, and Fixed target are set constant throughout the same period. These baselines and targets build upon an existing method for calculating baseline emissions factor for a CDM project activity that supplies electricity to the national grid, taking into account different countries\u2019 average efficiency of fossil power plants and generation mix. It is found that in order to reduce the total annual average emissions by 10 percent compared to the baselines, one option requires that (1) coal and gas power plants added during the period 2005-2020 have a 40 and 50 percent average conversion efficiency, respectively, and (2) the new capacity added in the different countries during 2005-2020 delivers on average 12 percent less coal based electricity than the build margin in 2005. Under this option, 410-540 MtCO2/year of reduction credits could be generated during 2012-2020. Among the seven countries, most of the total credits would be generated in China. The distribution of total credits among the studied countries is proportional to their share of the total emissions reduction.

Open pile burning in the vicinity of generation is frequently the only economic disposal option. A framework is developed to quantify air emissions reductions for projects that alternatively utilize bio-mass waste as fuel for energy production. A demonstration project was conducted involving the grinding and 97-km one-way transport of 6096 bone-dry metric tons (BDT) of mixed conifer forest slash in the Sierra Nevada foothills for use as fuel in a biomass power cogeneration facility. Compared with the traditional open pile burning method of disposal for the forest harvest slash, utilization of the slash for fuel reduced particulate matter (PM) emissions by 98% (6 kg PM/BDT biomass), nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 54% (1.6 kg NOx/BDT), nonmethane volatile organics (NMOCs) by 99% (4.7 kg NMOCs/BDT), carbon monoxide (CO) by 97% (58 kg CO/BDT), and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) by 17% (0.38 t CO2e/BDT).Emission contributions from biomass processing and transport operations are negligible. CO2e benefits are dependent on the emission characteristics of the displaced marginal electricity supply. Monetization of emissions reductions will assist with fuel sourcing activities and the conduct of biomass energy projects.

As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations.

A secondary objective was to determine the effect of supplementing the diet with WCS on milk yield and rumen function over the 12-wk feeding period. Fifty lactating cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 diets (control or WCS). The 2 separate groups were each offered, on average, 4.2 kg of DM/cow per day of alfalfa hay (a.m.) and 6.6 kg of DM/cow per day of ryegrass silage (p.m.) on the ground in bare paddocks each day for 12 wk. Cows in each group were also individually offered dietary supplements for 12 wk in a feed trough at milking times of 5.4 kg of DM/cow per day of cracked wheat grain and 0.5 kg of DM/cow per day of cottonseed meal (control) or 2.8 kg of DM/cow per day of cracked wheat grain and 2.61 kg of DM/cow per day of WCS. The 2 diets were formulated to be similar in their concentrations of CP and ME, but the WCS diet was designed to have a higher fat concentration. Samples of rumen fluid were collected per fistula from the rumen approximately 4 h after grain feeding in the morning. Samples were taken from 8 cows (4 cows/diet) on 2 consecutive days in wk 2 of the covariate and wk 3, 6, 10, and 12 of treatment and analyzed for volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, methanogens, and protozoa. The reduction in CH(4) emissions (g/d) because of WCS supplementation increased from 13% in wk 3 to 23% in wk 12 of treatment. Similarly, the reduction in CH(4) emissions (g/kg of DMI) increased from 5.1% in wk 3 to 14.5% in wk 12 of treatment. It was calculated that the average reduction in CH(4) emissions over the 12-wk period was 2.9% less CH(4) per 1% added fat, increasing from 1.5% in wk 3 to 4.4% less CH(4) in wk 12. There was no effect of WCS supplementation on rumen ammonia-N, rumen volatile fatty acids, rumen methanogens, and rumen protozoa. On average over the 12-wk period, supplementation with WCS decreased the yield of milk (10%), fat (11%), protein (14%), lactose (11%), and fat plus protein (12%) and BW gain (31%). The WCS supplementation had no effect on milk fat concentration but resulted in a decrease in concentration of protein (5%) and lactose (11%). The major finding from this study is that addition of WCS to the diet of lactating dairy cows resulted in a persistent reduction in CH(4) emissions (g of CH(4)/kg of DMI) over a 12-wk period and that these reductions in CH(4) are consistent with previous work that has studied the addition of oilseeds to ruminant diets.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f0846b0eb43c63bc828ac96959192988e379a23f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2941622160", "DOI": "10.1016/S0921-8009(01)00206-3", "CorpusId": 153133978}, "title": "The CO2 emission reduction benefits of Chinese energy policies and environmental policies:: A case study for Shanghai, period 1995-2020", "abstract": null, "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "d116826cfcf7867a9cac3918929de42e3ba1ec80", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2051247537", "DOI": "10.1021/es902838n", "CorpusId": 207882797, "PubMed": "20085253"}, "title": "Environmental life cycle comparison of algae to other bioenergy feedstocks.", "abstract": "Algae are an attractive source of biomass energy since they do not compete with food crops and have higher energy yields per area than terrestrial crops.

This Academy study addresses the external social and environmental costs \u2013 the externalities \u2013 that accompany all electricity generating technologies. As reviewed here, these are costs not accounted for in the market price of electricity arising from impacts on, for example, climate, human health, crops, structures and biodiversity. Until identified, and then if possible quantified in monetary terms, they remain hidden, playing a limited role in technology selection. The main rationale for this study is that the Australian Government, like others in the industrialised world, has adopted climate change policies such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) for constraining carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions. Reduction targets call for a new portfolio of low-emission electricity generating technologies. The Academy believes that to meet these targets the focus must be on technology. Its recent study Energy Technology for Climate Change: Accelerating the Technology Response looked at technical, commercial and investment issues for various technology scenarios. Around $250 billion will be needed to bring the new technologies into production by 2050. There will also be heavy development costs. While the power generation technologies of the future will inevitably have lower external impacts relating to CO2 emissions, there will be other externalities. With adequate understanding of those externalities, policy and investment decisions relating to electricity generation can take into account all social costs and benefits.

Unlike trading schemes in other countries, the Tokyo ETS covers indirect emissions from the commercial sector. It is well known that a variety of market barriers impede full realization of energy efficiency opportunities, especially in the commercial sector. Experiences with the Tokyo ETS should therefore provide important lessons for the design of climate change mitigation policies, especially when targeting the commercial sector. The emissions from covered entities have been drastically reduced from those at the scheme\u2019s outset, with an average 14% reduction as of the end of the first commitment period of five years (2010\u20132014) compared with 2009 levels. This paper shows that the Tokyo ETS alone did not cause these reductions; there were other drivers. Among them, the energy savings triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 were crucial. The contribution of credit trading, in contrast, was limited since most of the covered entities reduced emissions by themselves. Through an investigation of official reports, an assessment of the emissions data from the covered entities compared to those of uncovered entities and in-depth interviews with firms covered by the scheme, this paper confirms that the main drivers of emissions reductions by covered entities were separate from the ETS. In fact, the advisory aspect of the scheme seems to be much more important in encouraging energy-saving actions. Key policy insights Most of the observed emission reductions were not caused by the Tokyo ETS alone. An advisory instrument was crucial to the effectiveness of the Tokyo ETS. The experience of the Tokyo ETS suggests that making full use of the advantages of emissions trading is difficult in the case of the commercial sector.

Whereas methylphenidate blocks the dopamine transporter (main mechanism for removal of extracellular dopamine), it is unclear whether at doses used therapeutically it significantly changes extracellular dopamine (DA) concentration. Here we used positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride (D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous DA for binding to the receptor) to evaluate whether oral methylphenidate changes extracellular DA in the human brain in 11 healthy controls. We showed that oral methylphenidate (average dose 0.8 +/- 0.11 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular DA in brain, as evidenced by a significant reduction in B(max)/K(d) (measure of D2 receptor availability) in striatum (20 +/- 12%; p < 0.0005). These results provide direct evidence that oral methylphenidate at doses within the therapeutic range significantly increases extracellular DA in human brain. This result coupled with recent findings of increased dopamine transporters in ADHD patients (which is expected to result in reductions in extracellular DA) provides a mechanistic framework for the therapeutic efficacy of methylphenidate. The increase in DA caused by the blockade of dopamine transporters by methylphenidate predominantly reflects an amplification of spontaneously released DA, which in turn is responsive to environmental stimulation. Because DA decreases background firing rates and increases signal-to-noise in target neurons, we postulate that the amplification of weak DA signals in subjects with ADHD by methylphenidate would enhance task-specific signaling, improving attention and decreasing distractibility. Alternatively methylphenidate-induced increases in DA, a neurotransmitter involved with motivation and reward, could enhance the salience of the task facilitating the \"interest that it elicits\" and thus improving performance.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "70d6e9f7d9a7d305f752d78192d238c1a8dccb01", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1774733975", "DOI": "10.4271/942022", "CorpusId": 109891199}, "title": "Fuel Quality Effects on Particulate Matter Emissions from Light- and Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines", "abstract": "This paper gives an update of Shell`s ongoing research on correlations between diesel fuel quality and particulate emissions in both heavy and light duty applications.

Mitigation practices included dietary modifications aimed at reducing CH4 emissions (i.e., changed forage use levels, dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated lipids, use of corn distillers dried grains, improved forage quality) and improved animal husbandry (i.e., increased longevity of breeding stock, improved reproductive performance of the herd).

The LCA was conducted over 8 years to fully account for lifetime GHG emissions from breeding stock, as well as the progeny raised for market. The baseline scenario estimated the GHG emission intensity of beef production at 22 kg CO2 equivalent/kg carcass; 80% of GHG emissions were from the cow calf system and 20% from the feedlot system, with enteric CH4 accounting for 63% of total emissions. Strategies applied to the cow calf herd individually reduced total farm GHG intensity by up to 8% with up to a 17% total reduction possible by combining strategies. In comparison, strategies applied to the feedlot had only a small impact on GHG emissions; reducing total GHG intensity by less than 2% when applied individually or by 3\u20134% when applied in combination. Although the North American beef production system is already highly efficient, a number of mitigation strategies could be implemented to further lower GHG emissions associated with producing beef, with a total reduction of about 20% attainable if multiple strategies are applied to both the cow herd and the feedlot. However, the biggest reductions in GHG emissions are achieved when mitigation practices target reducing enteric CH4 from the breeding herd. When the grassland in the baseline scenario was newly seeded onto previously cropped land, its soil C gain more than offset all GHG emissions, changing the beef production system from a net emitter to a net sink of C.

Under this initiative, the Urban Heat Island Pilot Project (UHIPP) was created with the objective of investigating the potential of HIR strategies in residential and commercial buildings in three initial UHIPP cities: Baton Rouge, LA; Sacramento, CA; and Salt Lake City, UT. Later two other cities, Chicago, IL and Houston, TX were added to the UHIPP. In an earlier report we summarized our efforts to calculate the annual energy savings, peak power avoidance, and annual CO2 reduction obtainable from the introduction of HIR strategies in the initial three cities. This report summarizes the results of our study for Chicago and Houston. In this analysis, we focused on three building types that offer the highest potential savings: single-family residence, office and retail store. Each building type was characterized in detail by vintage and system type (i.e., old and new building constructions, and gas and electric heat). We used the prototypical building characteristics developed earlier for each building type and simulated the impact of HIR strategies on building cooling- and heating-energy use and peak power demand using the DOE-2.1E model. Our simulations included the impact of (1) strategically-placed shade trees near buildings [direct effect], (2) use of high-albedo roofing material on the building [direct effect], (3) urban reforestation with high-albedo pavements and building surfaces [indirect effect] and (4) combined strategies 1, 2, and 3 [direct and indirect effects]. We then estimated the total roof area of air-conditioned buildings in each city using readily obtainable data to calculate the metropolitan-wide impact of HIR strategies. The results show that in Chicago, potential annual energy savings of $30M could be realized by ratepayers from the combined direct and indirect effects of HIR strategies. Additionally, peak power avoidance is estimated at 400 MW and the reduction in annual carbon emissions at 58 ktC.

These results suggest that GDP loss is minimized with pathways with earlier emission reduction followed by more moderate reduction rates to achieve lower emission levels. Consequently, we suggest an early emission peak to meet the stringent target.

Optimal simulation of a market-based SO2 control policy for approximately 4,700 U.S. foreign commerce ships traveling in the SECAs in 2002 shows that SECA emissions control targets can be achieved by scrubbing exhaust gas of one out of ten ships with annual savings up to $480 million over performance-based policy. A market-based policy could save the fleet approximately $63 million annually under our best-estimate scenario. Spatial evaluation of ship emissions reductions shows that market-based instruments can reduce more SO2 closer to land while being more cost-effective for the fleet. Results suggest that combining performance requirements with market-based instruments can most effectively control SO2 emissions from ships.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "3e621a09f2824f72339cb78efc7e1c6001347fbb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980068745", "DOI": "10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00539.1", "CorpusId": 129571840}, "title": "Dynamical Downscaling Projections of Twenty-First-Century Atlantic Hurricane Activity: CMIP3 and CMIP5 Model-Based Scenarios", "abstract": "AbstractTwenty-first-century projections of Atlantic climate change are downscaled to explore the robustness of potential changes in hurricane activity.

The concentrations of organic aerosol and gas-phase organic nitrates were improved when particulate organic nitrates were assumed to undergo rapid (\u03c4 = 3 h) pseudohydrolysis resulting in nitric acid and nonvolatile secondary organic aerosol. In addition, up to 60% of less oxidized-oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) could be accounted for via organic nitrate mediated chemistry during the Southern Oxidants and Aerosol Study (SOAS). A 25% reduction in nitrogen oxide (NO + NO2) emissions was predicted to cause a 9% reduction in organic aerosol for June 2013 SOAS conditions at Centreville, Alabama.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "41982a6f1fface0a2baa76d224354fe244acebba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "778678789", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.05.032", "CorpusId": 152799884}, "title": "Opportunities for GHG emissions reduction in road projects: a comparative evaluation of emissions scenarios using CO2NSTRUCT", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0fefad00a84550905b5318e3470f899babeccf8b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2022691066", "DOI": "10.1057/MEL.2013.2", "CorpusId": 128688064}, "title": "Slow steaming impacts on ocean carriers and shippers", "abstract": "Ocean container carriers have implemented slow steaming (reduced vessel speeds) in recent years to improve fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However, many shippers oppose the practice due to increased pipeline inventory associated with longer transit times. Given this conflict, this article seeks to quantify the costs and benefits of slow steaming relative to carriers and shippers. We simulate a high volume Asia-North America container trade lane to estimate slow steaming impacts under different vessel speeds, volumes and fuel prices. Under current conditions, the results justify slow steaming practices, revealing extra slow steaming as the most beneficial vessel speed with a 20 per cent reduction in total costs and a 43 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Extra slow steaming is also optimal for future volumes and a wide range of fuel prices. Furthermore, the results detail carrier and shipper cost trade-offs, thus offering practical evidence and transparency to the industry on how to create financial equity in facilitating contractual-based agreements for vessel speed standards.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c654bbdf8999671639811e5ab758bb7f7d954525", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2010339701", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2011.09.011", "CorpusId": 55497009}, "title": "Boundaries matter: Greenhouse gas emission reductions from alternative waste treatment strategies for California's municipal solid waste", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b66a76accb361c832c41b9865a921ba33aec7edf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164872310", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2010.05.040", "CorpusId": 154612851}, "title": "The public perspective of carbon capture and storage for CO2 emission reductions in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "4e8b69df87fbe675768908edb862b8d4a9da55c1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2167933259", "DOI": "10.1504/IJGEI.2000.004352", "CorpusId": 15811383}, "title": "Kyoto and technology at the European Union: costs of emission reduction under flexibility mechanisms and technology progress", "abstract": "This paper presents the analysis of the consequences of CO2 emission reduction policies, as derived, in a European Union perspective, from the Kyoto Protocol for the 2010 horizon.
