The compression of freight transit times has been one of the most enduring logistics trends but may not be compatible with governmental climate change policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60\u201380% by 2050. Opportunities for cutting CO2 emissions by \u2018despeeding' are explored within a freight decarbonisation framework and split into three categories: direct, indirect and consequential. Discussion of the direct carbon savings focuses on the trucking and deep-sea container sectors, where there is clear evidence that slower operation cuts cost, energy and emissions and can be accommodated within current supply chain requirements. Indirect emission reductions could accrue from more localised sourcing and a relaxation of just-in-time (JIT) replenishment. Acceleration of logistical activities other than transport could offset increases in freight transit times, allowing the overall carbon intensity of supply chains to reduce with minimal loss of performance. Consequential deceleration results from other decarbonisation initiatives such as freight modal split and a shift to lower carbon fuels.

Carbon pricing is commonly meant to refer to two main types of climate policy instruments: carbon taxation and cap-and-trade. The price is levied on a unit of emissions of carbon dioxide, or some other greenhouse gas, measured in terms of its global warming potential. If working as intended, carbon pricing could supplant some of the legal mechanisms that work through administrative and enforcement agencies and other traditional legal channels. Carbon pricing thus devolves most emission abatement decisions to private actors and allows emitters to choose specific methods of emissions reduction, in so doing reducing reliance on regulatory compliance mechanisms and providing flexibility and certainty for regulated parties. Projecting the amount of emissions reductions from carbon pricing is challenging, as current economic data and tools are useful for making simple, ceteris paribus predictions, but less useful for modeling the complex and broad dynamics of a carbon price. The peer-reviewed literature, including reports by the U.S. Information Agency, suggest that a $25 per ton carbon price would reduce emissions by 11% to 31% by 2030. Other estimates suggest larger reductions are possible. Carbon pricing also presents the prospect of revenues, which can be used for a variety of purposes.

Tropical forest clearing accounts for roughly 20% of anthropogenic carbon emissions and destroys globally significant carbon sinks (IPCC 2007). Global climate policy initiatives are now being proposed to address these emissions and to more actively include developing countries in greenhouse gas mitigation (e.g. Santilli et al 2005, Gullison et al 2007). In 2005, at the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Montreal, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) launched a new initiative to assess the scientific and technical methods and issues for developing policy approaches and incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) in developing countries (Gullison et al 2007). Over the last two years the methods and tools needed to estimate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation have quickly evolved, as the scientific community responded to the UNFCCC policy needs. This focus issue highlights those advancements, covering some of the most important technical issues for measuring and monitoring emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and emphasizing immediately available methods and data, as well as future challenges. Elements for effective long-term implementation of a REDD mechanism related to both environmental and political concerns are discussed in Mollicone et al. Herold and Johns synthesize viewpoints of national parties to the UNFCCC on REDD and expand upon key issues for linking policy requirements and forest monitoring capabilities. In response to these expressed policy needs, they discuss a remote-sensing-based observation framework to start REDD implementation activities and build historical deforestation databases on the national level. Achard et al offer an assessment of remote sensing measurements across the world's tropical forests that can provide key consistency and prioritization for national-level efforts. Gibbs et al calculate a range of national-level forest carbon stock estimates that can be used immediately, and also review ground-based and remote sensing approaches to estimate national-level tropical carbon stocks with increased accuracy. These papers help illustrate that methodologies and tools are indeed available to estimate emissions from deforestation. Clearly, important technical challenges remain (e.g. quantifying degradation, assessing uncertainty, verification procedures, capacity building, and Landsat data continuity) but we now have a sufficient technical base to support REDD early actions and readiness mechanisms for building national monitoring systems. Thus, we enter the COP 13 in Bali, Indonesia with great hope for a more inclusive climate policy encompassing all countries and emissions sources from both land-use and energy sectors. Our understanding of tropical deforestation and carbon emissions is improving and with that, opportunities to conserve tropical forests and the host of ecosystem services they provide while also increasing revenue streams in developing countries through economic incentives to avoid deforestation and degradation.

Compared to our previous report, the impact on both the environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency is rather limited. The main decision in Marrakesh involved the additional 15 MtC of Russian sinks from forest management. This will increase hot air supply by about 5 per cent and decrease the permit price by US$1/tC compared to our earlier calculations. In terms of CO 2 equivalents, the Marrakesh Accords bring Annex I emissions in 2010 without the US a \u00bd per cent under base year levels; this is not the same as compared to the 1990-level. If CO 2 removals through sinks are seen as efforts additional to emission reductions to capture the overall effect on atmospheric CO 2 built-up, the decrease of a \u00bd per cent would run up to over 4 per cent under base year levels. The intention of Kazakhstan to join the Kyoto Protocol has little impact on the outcome of the evaluation; it will lead to more supply of hot air and hence further increase pressure on permit prices. Putting the results of our updated evaluation in perspective, we see that Annex I abatement efforts relative to baseline emissions vary from 0 to 3 per cent, depending on the baseline scenario. If removals through sinks are again seen as additional to emission reductions, this range would increase to nearly 6 per cent. Lower baseline emissions than in the A1B-scenario forecast an oversupply of permits that pushes the permit price towards zero and undermines the development of an emission trading market. Our updated evaluation underlines one of the main conclusions from our previous report that without US participation, banking large amounts of hot air is of absolute importance to improve the environmental effectiveness of the Protocol and enhance the development of a viable emissions trading market. A strategy of curtailing and banking permit supply is also in the interest of the dominant seller, in this case the Annex I FSU region. Banking all of the hot air will increase Annex I abatement efforts to over 8 per cent below baseline emissions in the reference scenario.

One of the important design questions in a trading program is how to initially distribute the emissions allowances. Under the Acid Rain program created by Title IV of the Clean Air Act, most emissions allowances were distributed to current emitters on the basis of a historic measure of electricity generation in an approach known as grandfathering. Recent proposals have suggested two alternative approaches: allocation according to a formula that is updated over time according to some performance metric in a recent year (the share of electricity generation or something else) and auctioning allowances to the highest bidders. Prior research has shown that the manner in which allowances for carbon dioxide (CO2) are initially distributed can have substantial effects on the social cost of the policy as well as on who wins and who loses as a result of the policy. Another concern with a regional cap-and-trade program like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the effect that different approaches to allocating emissions allowances will have on the level of CO2 emissions outside the region, commonly called emissions leakage. In this research we model historic, auction, and updating approaches to allowance allocation that we call bookends, then model various variations on these approaches. We consider changes in measures such as electricity price, the mix of generation technologies, and the emissions of conventional pollutants inside and outside the RGGI region. We examine the social cost of the program, measured as the change in economic surplus, which is the type of measure used in benefit\u2013cost analysis. We also examine the effects of different approaches to distributing allowances on the net present value of generation assets inside and outside the RGGI region. We find that how allowances are allocated has an effect on electricity price, consumption, and the mix of technologies used to generate electricity. Electricity price increases the most with a historic or auction approach. Coal-fired generation in the RGGI region decreases under all approaches but decreases the most under updating. Gas-fired generation decreases under historic and auction approaches but increases substantially under updating. Renewable generation increases under historic and auction approaches but decreases slightly under updating as a consequence of the expanded generation from gas. Consistent with the changes in the composition of generation, the decline in emissions of conventional pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury that was expected as a result of the Clean Air Interstate Rule is accelerated substantially as a result of the RGGI policy, particularly under updating. The cost of complying with SO2, NOx, and mercury rules declines similarly. We find that the social costs of the bookend auction and historic approaches are comparable and that the social cost of updating is roughly three times that of the other approaches. At the same time, updating yields greater emissions reductions on a national basis (because it produces less emissions leakage) and greater cumulative reductions in emissions at the national level than historic allocation. Varying the design of the updating approach can reduce its social costs but generally would increase leakage at the same time. An updating approach with allocation to all generators, including all nuclear and renewables has the lowest social cost within the RGGI region of any policy analyzed, although this result comes at the expense of costs imposed outside the region. When the approaches to allocation are mixed, we find the changes in electricity price, generation, and emissions are roughly a combination of the performance of each individual approach. In particular, social costs typically are lower under the scenarios that combine an auction with updating than when updating is the exclusive approach to distributing allowances. Who wins and who loses from the policy varies with the approach to allocation. Under a historic approach, producers in the RGGI region gain substantially and generally are better off than without the program; such is not true under an auction or updating. Producers also gain overall from the policy when a historic allocation is combined with an auction, but the gains are substantially less than in the 100% historic case. Producers outside the region tend to benefit considerably from the higher electricity price in the RGGI region but benefit the least under updating because the effect on electricity price is lowest. Consumers both inside and outside the RGGI region are adversely affected under all allocation approaches but much less so under updating because the change in electricity price is lowest. One exception is when eligibility for allowances under an updating allocation is limited to nonemitters only, in which case the electricity price increases substantially. Different types of generators fare differently under the various allocation approaches. Asset values for all types of generators are highest under a historic approach, although the difference between historic and auction approaches is small for nuclear generators. Compared with the baseline, both nuclear and existing gas-fired generators in the RGGI region gain under an auction. Only gas-fired generators gain under the bookend approach to updating, although nuclear generators benefit as well under updating designs that include them among those eligible for allowances. Coal-fired generators lose the most under updating. Moving from 100% updating to auctioning an increasingly larger share of allowances generally has a positive effect on asset values for all fuel types including coal. The one exception is that moving from 50% auction and 50% updating to 100% auction has a negative effect on the asset values for coal. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analyses with higher natural gas prices and constraints on electricity transmission capability. The social cost of the RGGI program does not appear to be sensitive to these constraints. Higher gas prices or transmission constraints alone impose significant costs that are larger than the effect of adding the RGGI policy. For example, their substantial effect on electricity price is greater than the added effect imposed by the RGGI program. The constraints that are modeled do not appear to have a strong impact on RGGI implementation. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis with renewables portfolio standard policies in place throughout the region. The resulting prices of electricity and CO2 emissions allowances are slightly lower than without the renewables policy.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "311c9a20bfe3799e7f085ae95a2ddfe3d4821d03", "externalIds": {"MAG": "571593542", "DOI": "10.1021/IE200227U", "CorpusId": 92902041}, "title": "Low Temperature NH3 Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx over Substituted MnCr2O4 Spinel-Oxide Catalysts", "abstract": "The present work describes the development of Mn1\u2013xMxCr2O4 (M = Mg, Ca; x = 0\u20130.1) substituted spinel catalysts prepared via gel combustion synthesis for the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3.

The objective of this paper is to explore a new approach to estimating vehicle emission impacts of freight corridor operations related to the port area, particularly those associated with heavy-duty diesel trucks. The paper combines a microscopic traffic simulation model to capture detailed vehicle trajectories (speeds and accelerations) and congestion effects, with an emission model and a spatial dispersion model to facilitate the estimation of the health and environmental justice impacts of freight corridor operations. Focus is on the I-710 freeway in the Alameda Corridor from the SPBP area up to downtown Los Angeles, California, some 20 mi north. Several scenarios were evaluated in addition to the 2005 base scenario: replacement of the current fleet of port heavy-duty diesel trucks with zero-emission vehicles, elimination of port heavy-duty diesel truck trips that would correspond to shifting more containers to other modes such as rail, and implementation of a truck-restricted lane, preventing trucks from using the leftmost lanes.

In this study, characterization of a null allele, cob-4, establishes the key role of COB in controlling anisotropic expansion in most developing organs. Quantitative polarized-light and field-emission scanning electron microscopy reveal that loss of anisotropic expansion in cob mutants is accompanied by disorganization of the orientation of cellulose microfibrils and subsequent reduction of crystalline cellulose. Analyses of the conditional cob-1 allele suggested that COB is primarily implicated in microfibril deposition during rapid elongation. Immunodetection analysis in elongating root cells revealed that, in agreement with its substitution by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, COB was polarly targeted to both the plasma membrane and the longitudinal cell walls and was distributed in a banding pattern perpendicular to the longitudinal axis via a microtubule-dependent mechanism.

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol provides industrialized countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at lowest cost that also promotes sustainable development in the host country. Wind power projects could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development, if developed correctly.ResultsOur estimates indicate that there is a vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by the use of wind energy in India. The annual potential Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) of wind power projects in India could theoretically reach 86 million. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of wind power projects based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 41 to 67 million and 78 to 83 million by 2020.ConclusionThe projections based on the past diffusion trend indicate that in India, even with highly favorable assumptions, the dissemination of wind power projects is not likely to reach its maximum estimated potential in another 15 years.

Using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, we examined how different land use and land cover patterns affect regional climate in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of North China, whose environmental and socioeconomic conditions are sensitive to climate change. We parameterized WRF using land use and land cover maps corresponding to 2001 and 2010 conditions, which differ in the representation of four land surface biophysical parameters: vegetation fraction, leaf area index (LAI), albedo, and emissivity. From 2001 to 2010, vegetation fraction and LAI increased in summer, emissivity increased and albedo decreased in winter. Our WRF simulations show that differences in land use and land cover patterns led to widespread reduction in summer temperature with local cooling on the order of 1 \u00b0C, and extensive increase in winter temperature with local warming exceeding 0.8 \u00b0C. By contrast, simulations using the default landscape representation, provided by WRF itself, show only minor and random changes in temperature. Model evaluation further reveals that our simulations with appropriate land surface properties improve the performance of the WRF model. Our findings demonstrate that LUCC in Northern China has altered the regional climate over the past decade.

Measurements were conducted by multiple research organizations for sulfur dioxide (SO2), total hydrocarbons (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), speciated gas-phase emissions, particulate matter (PM) mass and number, black carbon, and speciated PM. In addition, particle size distribution (PSD), number-based geometric mean particle diameter (GMD), and smoke number were also determined from the data collected. The results of the research showed PM mass emission indices (EIs) in the range of 20 to 700 mg/kg fuel and PM number EIs ranging from 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091015 to 5\u2009\u00d7\u20091015 particles/kg fuel depending on engine load and fuel type. In addition, significant reductions in both the SO2 and PM EIs were observed for the use of the FT fuel. These reductions were on the order of \u223c90% for SO2 and particle mass EIs and \u223c60% for the particle number EI, with similar decreases observed for black carbon. Also, the size of the particles generated by JP-8 combustion are noticeably larger than those emitted by the APU burning the FT fuel with the geometric mean diameters ranging from 20 to 50 nm depending on engine load and fuel type. Finally, both particle-bound sulfate and organics were reduced during FT-2 combustion. The PM sulfate was reduced by nearly 100% due to lack of sulfur in the fuel, with the PM organics reduced by a factor of \u223c5 as compared with JP-8. Implications: The results of this research show that APUs can be, depending on the level of fuel usage, an important source of air pollutant emissions at major airports in urban areas. Substantial decreases in emissions can also be achieved through the use of Fischer Tropsch (FT) fuel.

The engine mounted in the vehicle was a four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharging gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine with a displacement of 1.395 L. The test fuels include ethanol-gasoline, n-butanol-gasoline, and DMF-gasoline with four blending ratios of 20%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, and pure gasoline was also tested for comparison. The original contribution of this article is to systemically study the steady-state, transient-state, cold-start, and acceleration performance of the tested fuels under a wide range of blending ratios, especially at high blending ratios. It provides new insight and knowledge of the emission alleviation technique in terms of tailoring the biofuels in GDI turbocharged engines. The results of our works showed that operation with ethanol\u2013gasoline, n-butanol\u2013gasoline, and DMF\u2013gasoline at high blending ratios could be realized in the GDI vehicle without any modification to its engine and the control system at the steady state. At steady-state operation, as compared with pure gasoline, the results indicated that blending n-butanol could reduce CO2, CO, total hydrocarbon (THC), and NOX emissions, which were also decreased by employing a higher blending ratio of n-butanol. However, a high fraction of n-butanol increased the volumetric fuel consumption, and so did the DMF\u2013gasoline and ethanol\u2013gasoline blends. A large fraction of DMF reduced THC emissions, but increased CO2 and NOX emissions. Blending n-butanol can improve the equivalent fuel consumption. Moreover, the particle number (PN) emissions were significantly decreased when using the high blending ratios of the three kinds of oxygenated fuels. According to the results of the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) cycle, blending 20% of n-butanol with gasoline decreased CO2 emissions by 5.7% compared with pure gasoline and simultaneously reduced CO, THC, NOX emissions, while blending ethanol only reduced NOX emissions. PN and particulate matter (PM) emissions decreased significantly in all stages of the NEDC cycle with the oxygenated fuel blends; the highest reduction ratio in PN was 72.87% upon blending 20% ethanol at the NEDC cycle.

We use a set of three global integrated assessment models to analyze the implications of current climate policies on long-term mitigation targets. We define a weak-policy baseline scenario, which extrapolates the current policy environment by assuming that the global climate regime remains fragmented and that emission reduction efforts remain unambitious in most of the world\u2019s regions. These scenarios clearly fall short of limiting warming to 2\u00a0\u00b0C.

We find that after a deferral of ambitious action the 450\u00a0ppm CO2e is only achievable with a radical up-scaling of efforts after target adoption. This has severe effects on transformation pathways and exacerbates the challenges of climate stabilization, in particular for a delay of cooperative action until 2030.

We present different rules for allocating carbon allowances within sectors (lump-sum grandfathering, output-based allocation [OBA], and auctioning) and among sectors (historical emissions and value-added shares). Using a partial equilibrium model, we explore how OBA mitigates price increases, limits incentives for conservation in favor of lowering energy intensity, and changes relative output prices among sectors. We then use a computable general equilibrium model from the Global Trade Analysis Project, modified to incorporate a labor/leisure choice, to compare overall mechanism performance. The output subsidies implicit in OBA mitigate tax interactions, which can lead to higher welfare than grandfathering. OBA with sectoral distributions based on value added generates effective subsidies similar to a broad-based tax reduction, performing nearly like auctioning with revenue recycling, which generates the highest welfare. OBA based on historical emissions supports the output of more polluting industries, which more effectively counteracts carbon leakage but is more costly in welfare terms.

In this study, a unique regulatory mechanism of N2O reduction in Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27, an isolate affiliated with the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, was examined. Strain T-27 was incubated with N2O and/or O2 as the electron acceptor. Significant N2O reduction was observed only when O2 was initially present. When batch cultures of strain T-27 were amended with O2 and N2O, N2O reduction commenced after O2 was depleted. In a long-term incubation with the addition of N2O upon depletion, the N2O reduction rate decreased over time and came to an eventual stop. Spiking of the culture with O2 resulted in the resuscitation of N2O reduction activity, supporting the hypothesis that N2O reduction by strain T-27 required the transient presence of O2. The highest level of nosZ transcription (8.97 nosZ transcripts/recA transcript) was observed immediately after O2 depletion, and transcription decreased \u223c25-fold within 85 h, supporting the observed phenotype. The observed difference between responses of strain T-27 cultures amended with and without N2O to O2 starvation suggested that N2O helped sustain the viability of strain T-27 during temporary anoxia, although N2O reduction was not coupled to growth. The findings in this study suggest that obligate aerobic microorganisms with nosZ genes may utilize N2O as a temporary surrogate for O2 to survive periodic anoxia. IMPORTANCE Emission of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depletion agent, from the soil environment is largely determined by microbial sources and sinks. N2O reduction by organisms with N2O reductases (NosZ) is the only known biological sink of N2O at environmentally relevant concentrations (up to \u223c1,000 parts per million by volume [ppmv]). Although a large fraction of nosZ genes recovered from soil is affiliated with nosZ found in the genomes of the obligate aerobic phylum Gemmatimonadetes, N2O reduction has not yet been confirmed in any of these organisms. This study demonstrates that N2O is reduced by an obligate aerobic bacterium, Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27, and suggests a novel regulation mechanism for N2O reduction in this organism, which may also be applicable to other obligate aerobic organisms possessing nosZ genes. We expect that these findings will significantly advance the understanding of N2O dynamics in environments with frequent transitions between oxic and anoxic conditions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "3fbc2d1af75ad75c482c82d4440a8eb94710866c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1968273070", "DOI": "10.1080/03655230600895317", "CorpusId": 13241183, "PubMed": "17114149"}, "title": "The impact of auditory cortex activity on characterizing and treating patients with chronic tinnitus \u2013 first results from a PET study", "abstract": "Conclusion: Unilaterally increased metabolic activity within the primary auditory cortex (PAC) represents a robust finding in tinnitus patients.

Model development has been described previously for vehicles operating under stoichiometric and enrichment conditions. A modal emissions model is presented for vehicles operated under enleanment conditions. Enleanment typically occurs with sharp deceleration or load reduction events, and sometimes during long deceleration. Under enleanment conditions, the air/fuel ratio is lean and incomplete combustion or misfire occurs. Preliminary research indicates that enleanment emissions (particularly for hydrocarbons) contribute significantly to a vehicle\u2019s overall emissions. An enleanment emissions module has been developed on the basis of second-by-second emission measurements generated at the College of Engineering\u2014Center for Environmental Research and Technology\u2019s vehicle testing facility using the Federal Test Procedure, US06, and a specially designed modal emission cycle (MEC01). On the basis of more than 200 vehicles tested and modeled, lean-burn hydrocarbon emissions (HClean) account for 10 to 20 percent of the overall HC emissions under the various test cycles. HClean emission contributions vary greatly from vehicle to vehicle, ranging from near 0 to more than 30 percent of total HC emissions of individual vehicles. After detailed analysis of the second-by-second emission data over the modal emission cycle MECO1, it was found that enleanment hydrocarbons emissions are mostly associated with rapid load reduction events and long deceleration events. The former is most likely to cause extremely high levels of HC as short spikes, and the latter is mostly associated with longer-lasting HC puffs. A methodology has been developed to characterize and model enleanment hydrocarbons emissions associated with these two events. The model estimates are compared with measurements, with encouraging results.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "aa758c60ac46e4cee41c2d61577ec033c76ce3d1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2067313140", "DOI": "10.1080/19373260.2010.492588", "CorpusId": 110565004}, "title": "Characteristics of ultra-high performance \u2018ductile\u2019 concrete and its impact on sustainable construction", "abstract": "This article presents an overview of the material characteristics of a Malaysia blend of ultra-high performance \u2018ductile\u2019 concrete (UHPdC).

That is, the overall cost of achieving a given aggregate emission reduction will be minimized, and the final allocation of permits will be independent of the initial allocation. We call this the independence property. This property is very important because it allows equity and efficiency concerns to be separated in a relatively straightforward manner. In particular, the property means that the government can establish the overall pollution-reduction goal for a cap-and-trade system by setting the cap, and leave it up to the legislature \u2013 such as the U.S. Congress \u2013 to construct a constituency in support of the program by allocating the allowances to various interests without affecting either the environmental performance of the system or its aggregate social costs.

Results show that the total GHG emissions of industrial process has increased, from 1.48 Mt in 2004 to 4.06 Mt in 2009, except for a little decrease in 2008. The cement industry, and iron and steel industries, are the main emission sources, accounting for more than 90% of the total carbon emissions. GHG emissions in 2020 are estimated based on scenario analysis. The research indicates that the cement industry, and iron and steel industries, will still be the largest emission sources, and the total carbon emissions under the business as usual (BAU) scenario will be doubled in 2020 compared with that of 2009. However, when countermeasures are taken, the GHG emission will reduce significantly. Using more clinker substitutes for blended cement, and increasing direct reduction iron process and recycled steel scraps are efficient measures in reducing GHG emission. Scenario 4, which has the highest ratio of 30/70 blended cement and the highest ratio of steel with recycled steel-EAF process, is the best one. In this scenario, the industrial process GHG emission in 2020 can almost stay the same as that of 2009.

Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic knowledge of the exact inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc stages in a signal processing chain, the composition of which depends on the details of each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to optimize reconstruction performance.

We further demonstrate that manifold learning during training results in sparse representations of domain transforms along low-dimensional data manifolds, and observe superior immunity to noise and a reduction in reconstruction artefacts compared with conventional handcrafted reconstruction methods.

Despite the technological relevance of tracing rational guidelines for optimizing their performances and stability beyond their intrinsic resilience to structural imperfections, no in-depth study of the role of selective carrier trapping and environmental conditions on their exciton dynamics has been reported to date. Here we conduct spectro-electrochemical (SEC) experiments, side-by-side to oxygen sensing measurements on CsPbBr3 NCs for the first time. We show that the application of EC potentials controls the emission intensity by altering the occupancy of defect states without degrading the NCs. Reductive potentials lead to strong (60%) emission quenching by trapping of photogenerated holes, whereas the concomitant suppression of electron trapping is nearly inconsequential to the emission efficiency. Consistently, oxidizing conditions result in minor (5%) brightening due to suppressed hole trapping, confirming that electron traps play a minor role in nonradiative decay. This behavior is rationalized through a model that links the occupancy of trap sites with the position of the NC Fermi level controlled by the EC potential. Photoluminescence measurements in controlled atmosphere reveal strong quenching by collisional interactions with O2, which is in contrast to the photobrightening effect observed in films and single crystals. This indicates that O2 acts as a scavenger of photoexcited electrons without mediation by structural defects and, together with the asymmetrical SEC response, suggests that electron-rich defects are likely less abundant in nanostructured perovskites than in the bulk, leading to an emission response dominated by direct interaction with the environment.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "978c3c4a122effa762131afa05720f4a5783a74c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986851502", "DOI": "10.1021/ES011485+", "CorpusId": 46529804, "PubMed": "12141486"}, "title": "Increases in food web cadmium following reductions in atmospheric inputs to some lakes.", "abstract": "We measured the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) over a 13-year interval in lakes located near two metal smelters to determine whether reductions in atmospheric Cd emissions have led to reductions in the Cd present in aquatic food webs.

The chemistry simulation shows large spatial variability in soot deposition that reflects the localized emissions and the influence of the complex terrain. The soot-induced snow albedo perturbations increase the surface net solar radiation flux during late winter to early spring, increase the surface air temperature, and reduce the snow accumulation and spring snowmelt. These effects are stronger over the central Rockies and southern Alberta, where soot deposition and snowpack overlap the most. The indirect forcing of soot accelerates snowmelt and alters stream flows, including a trend toward earlier melt dates in the western United States. The soot-induced albedo reduction initiates a positive feedback process whereby dirty snow absorbs more solar radiation, heating the surface and warming the air. This warming causes reduced snow depth and fraction, which further reduces the regional surface albedo for the snow-covered regions.

However, there are certain limitations with both technologies due to their inherent technical characteristics. Both technologies get 75-90% reduction of HC and CO. A typical oxidation catalyst can be applied to almost any heavy duty diesel application and achieve 20 to 30% reduction in PM mass but no significant reduction in the number of PM particles. On the other hand, diesel particulate filters are very effective at removing >90% of the particles by mass and >99% by number. Unfortunately, passive DPF technology cannot be applied to all applications since the filter regeneration is limited by engine out NOx to PM ratio as well as exhaust temperature. For this reason, particulate filters can not universally be applied to older \u201cdirtier\u201d engines with high PM emissions. This creates a technology gap for a passive device that can be successfully applied to old, high PM emission engines to achieve significant reduction in both PM mass and PM number. This paper will discuss the development of a passive PM control device referred to as a partial filter technology or PFT. This device combines an oxidation catalyst with a unique filter technology that can reduce PM by up to 77%. The new filter material combines the attributes of a flow through substrate with those of a wall flow filter to collect some but not necessarily all the engine out soot and thus provide PM reduction without leading to filter plugging. Due to the flow through characteristics, excess soot beyond filter capacity is not collected in the PFT and thus the exhaust is able to continue to flow without a significant increase in back pressure. The PFT system also utilizes the NO2:C reaction used by passive diesel particulate filter systems to oxidize a portion of the soot and passively regenerate the filter. In addition, the filter does not accumulate significant amounts of lube oil ash and this may minimize the need for a periodic ash cleaning maintenance. Engine bench emission testing with this system has shown PM reductions ranging from 77% for fresh (degreened) system to 63% for an aged system along with >90% HC and CO reductions. On-road operational data collected on various model year applications over a two year period has shown stable back pressure since installation. In addition, no adverse operational or maintenance issues were noted which can be attributed to the installation of the PFT system. This paper describes the development and testing of this passively regenerating partial filter technology.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "fa20fd7ac47173a6f7bec7472d2dc11ea76a07a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2962935661", "DOI": "10.3390/SU11143969", "CorpusId": 200076494}, "title": "A Study on the Limitations of South Korea\u2019s National Roadmap for Greenhouse Gas Reduction by 2030 and Suggestions for Improvement", "abstract": "South Korea must submit its targets for greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 to comply with the Paris Agreement.

Thus, exploring GHG emissions that occur at the soil\u2010atmosphere interface is an essential part of the effort to integrate land management strategies with climate change mitigation and adaptation in southern Africa. We measured soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from rain\u2010fed perennial tropical grassland, wastewater\u2010irrigated perennial tropical pastureland, recently cleared woodland, miombo woodland, a Eucalyptus plantation, regular cropland and recently cleared\u2010and\u2010cropped land, on two contrasting soils at five sites in one cropping season in Zimbabwe.

We investigated the use of surface application of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS) for reducing 1,3-D volatilization. In packed soil columns, emission of 1,3-D applied by sub-surface injection decreased with increasing ATS application rate and the amount of water used for delivering ATS. When ATS was applied in 9 mm water at 64g m \u02c72 , total 1,3-D emission was reduced by 61%. The reduction was 89% when ATS was applied at 193 g m \u02c72 . Bioassays showed that ATS application did not affect the effectiveness of 1,3-D for controlling citrus nematodes. In field plots where a 1,3-D emulsified formulation was applied via sub-surface drip, surface spray of ATS reduced 1,3-D emissions by 50%, and by 71% when the surface was also covered with polyethylene film.

Reducing black carbon (BC) emissions has been recognized as an\nefficient way to simultaneously improve air quality and mitigate climate\nchange. However, the benefits of BC emission controls are not well\nquantified,\npartly due to a lack of understanding of the changes in BC light absorption\nas a result of emission reductions. In this work, we discuss the effects of\nmulti-pollutant emission reductions on BC light absorption based on a\nfield campaign study conducted before, during and after the 2014 APEC\n(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting in Beijing, China. When emission\nrestrictions were in place during APEC, we found that the reduction in the\nlight absorption of BC-containing particles was driven by both the decrease\nin BC mass concentration and the weakened light-absorption capability of BC.\nCompared with that before and after APEC, the daytime light absorption of\nBC-containing particles during APEC was reduced by \u223c56\u2009%, of which\n\u223c48% was contributed by the decrease in BC mass concentration and the\nremaining \u223c8\u2009% was contributed by a weakening of light-absorption\ncapability for BC. Based on single-particle soot photometer (SP2)\nmeasurements\nand Mie calculations, we estimated that the light-absorption capability of\nBC-containing particles with \u223c80\u2013200\u2009nm refractory BC (rBC) cores in\ndaytime during APEC was reduced by \u223c6\u201315\u2009% and \u223c10\u201320\u2009%\ncompared with those before and after APEC, respectively. The decrease in BC\nlight-absorption capability could be attributed to less coating material on\nBC surfaces as a result of the decreased chemical production of secondary\naerosols. Compared with that before and after APEC, the mass ratio between\nthe coating materials and rBC core (\u223c80\u2013200\u2009nm) during APEC decreased\nby \u223c10\u201330\u2009% and \u223c31\u201353\u2009%, respectively, due to reductions in\ncoating precursor emissions, e.g., SO2 and NO2.

The primary sources of this uncertainty are the coarse spatial variation of activity data and the incomplete model representation of N2O emissions in response to agricultural management. Here, we provide new data\u2010driven estimates of cropland\u2010N2O emissions across China in 1990\u20132014, compiled using a global cropland\u2010N2O flux observation dataset, nationwide survey\u2010based reconstruction of N\u2010fertilization and irrigation, and an updated nonlinear model.

We find that China's annual cropland\u2010N2O emissions increased on average by 11.2 Gg N/year2 (p < .001) from 1990 to 2003, after which emissions plateaued until 2014 (2.8 Gg N/year2, p = .02), consistent with the output from an ensemble of process\u2010based terrestrial biosphere models. The slowdown of the increase in cropland\u2010N2O emissions after 2003 was pervasive across two thirds of China's sowing areas. This change was mainly driven by the nationwide reduction in N\u2010fertilizer applied per area, partially due to the prevalence of nationwide technological adoptions. This reduction has almost offset the N2O emissions induced by policy\u2010driven expansion of sowing areas, particularly in the Northeast Plain and the lower Yangtze River Basin.

The considered impact categories are greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, acidification, eutrophication and groundwater pollution. LCA results indicated that total emissions in systems based on FYM are much higher than in liquid slurry systems for most of the considered impact categories. The benefits of digestion of stable wastes in comparison with the reference system without digestion are mainly (1) the net reduction of the emissions of GHG and (2) energy recovery from produced biogas, while the disadvantages can be higher emissions of NH3 after spreading. The effects of additional biogas digestion of biomass such as crop residues (e.g., straw of peas and cereals) and cover crops are: (1) an optimization of the N-cycle and therewith higher yields; (2) higher energy production per unit arable land; (3) a further reduction of the GHG balance; but (4) higher N-related environmental burdens like eutrophication and acidification. The offsets of fossil fuel emissions were the largest GHG sink in most of the biogas digestion systems. The inclusion of a biogas plant into organic cropping systems and the use of the available wastes for production of energy largely increased the overall productivity of the farming system and matched very well the basic principles of organic farming such as a high self-sufficiency of the cropping system and reducing as much as possible the environmental impact of farming.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "d78886371e3af8827a3d724eaa26dd2db9a3f9b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2272752730", "DOI": "10.1080/23311916.2015.1134304", "CorpusId": 112907077}, "title": "Feasibility of biomass heating system in Middle East Technical University, Northern Cyprus Campus", "abstract": "Abstract Global interest in using biomass feedstock to produce heat and power is increasing.
