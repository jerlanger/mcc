From our measurements at the semi-polluted Heidelberg site in the upper Rhine Valley, we find that in the catchment area CH4 emissions decreased on average by 32\u00b16% from the second half of the 1990s until the first half of the 2000s, but the observed long-term trend of emissions is considerably smaller than that previously reported for southwest Germany.

We find that, after accounting for meteorological variations, lockdown events have reduced the population-weighted concentration of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter levels by about 60% and 31% in 34 countries, with mixed effects on ozone. Reductions in transportation sector emissions are largely responsible for the NO2 anomalies. The lockdown response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic and transport activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations, using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find declines in the population-weighted concentration of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 60% with 95% CI 48 to 72%), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: 31%; 95% CI: 17 to 45%), with marginal increases in ozone (O3: 4%; 95% CI: \u22122 to 10%) in 34 countries during lockdown dates up until 15 May. Except for ozone, satellite measurements of the troposphere indicate much smaller reductions, highlighting the spatial variability of pollutant anomalies attributable to complex NOx chemistry and long-distance transport of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5). By leveraging Google and Apple mobility data, we find empirical evidence for a link between global vehicle transportation declines and the reduction of ambient NO2 exposure.

Owing to their large-scale use, production of cement and concrete results in substantial emission of greenhouse gases and places strain on the availability of natural resources, such as water. Projected urbanization over the next 50\u2013100 years therefore indicates that the demand for cement and concrete will continue to increase, necessitating strategies to limit their environmental impact. In this Review, we shed light on the available solutions that can be implemented within the next decade and beyond to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cement and concrete production. As the construction sector has proven to be very slow-moving and risk-averse, we focus on minor improvements that can be achieved across the value chain, such as the use of supplementary cementitious materials and optimizing the clinker content of cement. Critically, the combined effect of these marginal gains can have an important impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% if all stakeholders are engaged. In doing so, we reveal credible pathways for sustainable concrete use that balance societal needs, environmental requirements and technical feasibility. Concrete is one of the most widely used man-made materials and is critical for the ongoing urbanization of the global population. However, owing to its widespread use, concrete can have a negative impact on the environment. This Review provides medium-term and long-term solutions to address the environmental concerns surrounding concrete production.

The environmental impact of cement and concrete production is low per unit volume of material, but the amounts used make the impact of the concrete sector highly important.

Grasslands cover about 20 per cent of the temperate land surface of the Earth and are widely used as pasture. It has been suggested that high animal stocking rates and the resulting elevated nitrogen input increase N2O emissions. Internationally agreed methods to upscale the effect of increased livestock numbers on N2O emissions are based directly on per capita nitrogen inputs. However, measurements of grassland N2O fluxes are often performed over short time periods, with low time resolution and mostly during the growing season. In consequence, our understanding of the daily and seasonal dynamics of grassland N2O fluxes remains limited. Here we report year-round N2O flux measurements with high and low temporal resolution at ten steppe grassland sites in Inner Mongolia, China. We show that short-lived pulses of N2O emission during spring thaw dominate the annual N2O budget at our study sites. The N2O emission pulses are highest in ungrazed steppe and decrease with increasing stocking rate, suggesting that grazing decreases rather than increases N2O emissions. Our results show that the stimulatory effect of higher stocking rates on nitrogen cycling and, hence, on N2O emission is more than offset by the effects of a parallel reduction in microbial biomass, inorganic nitrogen production and wintertime water retention.

Today many of the world\u2019s chemicals are produced from fossil fuel\u2013derived feedstocks. Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemical feedstocks offers a way to turn waste emissions into valuable products, closing the carbon loop. When coupled to renewable sources of electricity, these products can be made with a net negative carbon emissions footprint, helping to sequester CO2 into usable goods. Research and development into electrocatalytic materials for CO2 reduction has intensified in recent years, with advances in selectivity, efficiency, and reaction rate progressing toward practical implementation. A variety of chemical products can be made from CO2, such as alcohols, oxygenates, synthesis gas (syngas), and olefins\u2014staples in the global chemical industry. Because these products are produced at substantial scale, a switch to renewably powered production could result in a substantial carbon emissions reduction impact. The advancement of electrochemical technology to convert electrons generated from renewable power into stable chemical form also represents one avenue to long-term (e.g., seasonal) storage of energy. ADVANCES The science of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction continues to progress, with priority given to the need to pinpoint more accurately the targets for practical application, the economics of chemical products, and barriers to market entry. It will be important to scale CO2 electrolyzers and increase the stability of these catalysts to thousands of hours of continuous operation. Product separation and efficient recycling of CO2 and electrolyte also need to be managed. The petrochemical industry operates at a massive scale with a complicated global supply chain and heavy capital costs. Commodity chemical markets are difficult to penetrate and are priced on feedstock, which is currently inexpensive as a result of the shale gas boom. CO2 capture costs from the flue or direct air and product separation from unreacted CO2 are also important to consider. Assuming that the advancement of electrocatalytic technologies continues apace, what will it take to disrupt the chemical production sector, and what will society gain by doing so? This review presents a technoeconomic and carbon emissions assessment of CO2 products such as ethylene, ethanol, and carbon monoxide, offering target figures of merit for practical application. The price of electricity is by far the largest cost driver. Electrochemical production costs begin to match those of traditional fossil fuel\u2013derived processes when electricity prices fall below 4 cents per kWh and energy conversion efficiencies reach at least 60%. When powered by renewable electricity, these products can be made with a net negative carbon emissions footprint. A comparative analysis of electrocatalytic, biocatalytic, and fossil fuel\u2013derived chemical production shows that electrocatalytic production has the potential to yield the greatest reduction in carbon emissions, provided that a steady supply of clean electricity is available. Additionally, opportunities exist to combine electrochemical conversion of CO2 with a range of other thermo- and biocatalytic processes to slowly electrify the existing petrochemical supply chain and further upgrade CO2 into more useful chemicals. Technical challenges such as operating lifetime, energy efficiency, and product separation are discussed. Supply chain management of products and entrenched industrial petrochemical competition are also considered. OUTLOOK There exists increasingly widespread recognition of the need to transition to carbon emissions\u2013free means of chemical production. CO2 pricing mechanisms are being developed and are seeing increased governmental support. The nascent carbon utilization economy is gaining traction, with startup companies, global prizes, and industrial research efforts all pursuing new carbon conversion technologies. Recent advances in electrochemical CO2 reduction through the use of gas diffusion electrodes are pushing current densities and selectivities into a realm of industrial use. Despite this progress, there remain technical challenges that must be overcome for commercial application. Additionally, market barriers and cost economics will ultimately decide whether this technology experiences widespread implementation. Electrochemical CO2 conversion. Reduction of CO2 using renewably sourced electricity could transform waste CO2 emissions into commodity chemical feedstocks or fuels. Electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into chemical feedstocks offers the potential to reduce carbon emissions by shifting the chemical industry away from fossil fuel dependence. We provide a technoeconomic and carbon emission analysis of possible products, offering targets that would need to be met for economically compelling industrial implementation to be achieved. We also provide a comparison of the projected costs and CO2 emissions across electrocatalytic, biocatalytic, and fossil fuel\u2013derived production of chemical feedstocks. We find that for electrosynthesis to become competitive with fossil fuel\u2013derived feedstocks, electrical-to-chemical conversion efficiencies need to reach at least 60%, and renewable electricity prices need to fall below 4 cents per kilowatt-hour. We discuss the possibility of combining electro- and biocatalytic processes, using sequential upgrading of CO2 as a representative case. We describe the technical challenges and economic barriers to marketable electrosynthesized chemicals.

Yet, despite the ocean\u2019s critical role in regulating climate\u2014and providing food security and livelihoods for millions of people\u2014international climate negotiations have only minimally considered impacts on the ocean.

To do this, we draw on the consensus science in the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and papers published since the assessment.

Warm-water corals have already been affected, as have mid-latitude seagrass, high-latitude pteropods and krill, mid-latitude bivalves, and fin fishes. Even under the stringent emissions scenario (RCP2.6), warm-water corals and mid-latitude bivalves will be at high risk by 2100. Under our current rate of emissions, most marine organisms evaluated will have very high risk of impacts by 2100 and many by 2050. These results\u2014derived from experiments, field observations, and modeling\u2014are consistent with evidence from high-CO2 periods in the paleorecord. Impacts to the ocean\u2019s ecosystem services follow a parallel trajectory. Services such as coastal protection and capture fisheries are already affected by ocean warming and acidification. The risks of impacts to these services increase with continued emissions: They are predicted to remain moderate for the next 85 years for most services under stringent emission reductions, but the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5) would put all ecosystem services we considered at high or very high risk over the same time frame. These impacts will be cumulative or synergistic with other human impacts, such as overexploitation of living resources, habitat destruction, and pollution. Fin fisheries at low latitudes, which are a key source of protein and income for millions of people, will be at high risk. OUTLOOK Four key messages emerge. First, the ocean strongly influences the climate system and provides important services to humans. Second, impacts on key marine and coastal organisms, ecosystems, and services are already detectable, and several will face high risk of impacts well before 2100, even under the low-emissions scenario (RCP2.6). These impacts will occur across all latitudes, making this a global concern beyond the north/south divide. Third, immediate and substantial reduction of CO2 emissions is required to prevent the massive and mostly irreversible impacts on ocean ecosystems and their services that are projected with emissions greater than those in RCP2.6. Limiting emissions to this level is necessary to meet stated objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; a substantially different ocean would result from any less-stringent emissions scenario. Fourth, as atmospheric CO2 increases, protection, adaptation, and repair options for the ocean become fewer and less effective. The ocean provides compelling arguments for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions and eventually atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Hence, any new global climate agreement that does not minimize the impacts on the ocean will be inadequate. Changes in ocean physics and chemistry and impacts on organisms and ecosystem services according to stringent (RCP2.6) and high business-as-usual (RCP8.5) CO2 emissions scenarios. Changes in temperature (\u2206T) and pH (\u2206pH) in 2090 to 2099 are relative to preindustrial (1870 to 1899). Sea level rise (SLR) in 2100 is relative to 1901. RCP2.6 is much more favorable to the ocean, although important ecosystems, goods, and services remain vulnerable, and allows more-efficient management options. l, m, h: low, mid-, and high latitudes, respectively. The ocean moderates anthropogenic climate change at the cost of profound alterations of its physics, chemistry, ecology, and services. Here, we evaluate and compare the risks of impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems\u2014and the goods and services they provide\u2014for growing cumulative carbon emissions under two contrasting emissions scenarios. The current emissions trajectory would rapidly and significantly alter many ecosystems and the associated services on which humans heavily depend. A reduced emissions scenario\u2014consistent with the Copenhagen Accord\u2019s goal of a global temperature increase of less than 2\u00b0C\u2014is much more favorable to the ocean but still substantially alters important marine ecosystems and associated goods and services. The management options to address ocean impacts narrow as the ocean warms and acidifies. Consequently, any new climate regime that fails to minimize ocean impacts would be incomplete and inadequate.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "711a239fc6dfe9c596f92d61065b9ac1b1b65502", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016470740", "DOI": "10.1021/J100248A024", "CorpusId": 91830205}, "title": "Solvent effects on emission yield and lifetime for coumarin laser dyes.

Seven measures were identified that, if rapidly implemented, would significantly reduce global warming over the next 50 years, with the potential to prevent millions of deaths worldwide from outdoor air pollution. Furthermore, some crop yields could be improved by decreasing agricultural damage. Most of the measures thus appear to have economic benefits well above the cost of their implementation. Reducing anthropogenic emissions of methane and black carbon would have multiple climate and health benefits. Tropospheric ozone and black carbon (BC) contribute to both degraded air quality and global warming. We considered ~400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming ~0.5\u00b0C by 2050. This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than $250).

The dependence of the taxi-out time on these factors is analyzed and modeled. The performance of the model is validated through a comparison of its predictions with observed data at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport (BOS).

Different scenarios examine the impacts with revenue recycling through a uniform sales tax reduction, reduction of labor income tax, reduction of business income tax, direct transfer back to households, and use by the government to reduce debt.

Among those who declined, the baseline EC predicted longitudinal memory and temporal neocortex metabolic reductions. At follow-up, those who declined showed memory impairment and hypometabolism in temporal lobe neocortex and Hip. Among those subjects who declined, apolipoprotein E E4 carriers showed marked longitudinal temporal neocortex reductions.

The top ten most produced ENMs by mass were analyzed in a dozen major applications. Emissions during the manufacturing, use, and disposal stages were estimated, including intermediate steps through wastewater treatment plants and waste incineration plants.

Previous analyses have used single N-rate experiments to define a linear response to N additions across climate, management, and soil conditions globally. Here, we provide a first quantitative comparison of N2O emissions for all available studies that have used multiple N rates. Results show that a nonlinear emission factor better represents global emission patterns with lower uncertainty, offering more power for balancing the global N2O budget and for designing effective mitigation strategies. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) that also depletes stratospheric ozone. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate is the best single predictor of N2O emissions from agricultural soils, which are responsible for \u223c50% of the total global anthropogenic flux, but it is a relatively imprecise estimator. Accumulating evidence suggests that the emission response to increasing N input is exponential rather than linear, as assumed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodologies. We performed a metaanalysis to test the generalizability of this pattern. From 78 published studies (233 site-years) with at least three N-input levels, we calculated N2O emission factors (EFs) for each nonzero input level as a percentage of N input converted to N2O emissions. We found that the N2O response to N inputs grew significantly faster than linear for synthetic fertilizers and for most crop types. N-fixing crops had a higher rate of change in EF (\u0394EF) than others. A higher \u0394EF was also evident in soils with carbon >1.5% and soils with pH <7, and where fertilizer was applied only once annually. Our results suggest a general trend of exponentially increasing N2O emissions as N inputs increase to exceed crop needs. Use of this knowledge in GHG inventories should improve assessments of fertilizer-derived N2O emissions, help address disparities in the global N2O budget, and refine the accuracy of N2O mitigation protocols.

Yet, the emissions savings from ME remain poorly understood, owing in part to the multitude of material uses and diversity of circumstances and in part to a lack of analytical effort.

We find that there can be a systematic trade-off between material use in the production of buildings, vehicles, and appliances and energy use in their operation, requiring a careful life cycle assessment of ME strategies. We find that the largest potential emission reductions quantified in the literature result from more intensive use of and lifetime extension for buildings and the light-weighting and reduced size of vehicles.

A review of enteric methane mitigation options.", "abstract": "The goal of this review was to analyze published data related to mitigation of enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminant animals to document the most effective and sustainable strategies. Increasing forage digestibility and digestible forage intake was one of the major recommended CH4 mitigation practices. Although responses vary, CH4 emissions can be reduced when corn silage replaces grass silage in the diet. Feeding legume silages could also lower CH4 emissions compared to grass silage due to their lower fiber concentration. Dietary lipids can be effective in reducing CH4 emissions, but their applicability will depend on effects on feed intake, fiber digestibility, production, and milk composition. Inclusion of concentrate feeds in the diet of ruminants will likely decrease CH4 emission intensity (Ei; CH4 per unit animal product), particularly when inclusion is above 40% of dietary dry matter and rumen function is not impaired. Supplementation of diets containing medium to poor quality forages with small amounts of concentrate feed will typically decrease CH4 Ei. Nitrates show promise as CH4 mitigation agents, but more studies are needed to fully understand their impact on whole-farm greenhouse gas emissions, animal productivity, and animal health. Through their effect on feed efficiency and rumen stoichiometry, ionophores are likely to have a moderate CH4 mitigating effect in ruminants fed high-grain or mixed grain-forage diets. Tannins may also reduce CH4 emissions although in some situations intake and milk production may be compromised. Some direct-fed microbials, such as yeast-based products, might have a moderate CH4-mitigating effect through increasing animal productivity and feed efficiency, but the effect is likely to be inconsistent. Vaccines against rumen archaea may offer mitigation opportunities in the future although the extent of CH4 reduction is likely to be small and adaptation by ruminal microbes and persistence of the effect is unknown. Overall, improving forage quality and the overall efficiency of dietary nutrient use is an effective way of decreasing CH4 Ei.

The clean air actions implemented by the Chinese\ngovernment in 2013 have led to significantly improved air quality in\nBeijing. In this work, we combined the in\u00a0situ measurements of the chemical\ncomponents of submicron particles (PM1) in Beijing during the winters\nof 2014 and 2017 and a regional chemical transport model to investigate the\nimpact of clean air actions on aerosol chemistry and quantify the relative\ncontributions of anthropogenic emissions, meteorological conditions, and\nregional transport to the changes in aerosol chemical composition from 2014\nto 2017. We found that the average PM1 concentration in winter in\nBeijing decreased by 49.5\u2009% from 2014 to 2017 (from 66.2\nto 33.4\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123). Sulfate exhibited a much larger decline than\nnitrate and ammonium, which led to a rapid transition from sulfate-driven to\nnitrate-driven aerosol pollution during the wintertime. Organic aerosol\n(OA), especially coal combustion OA, and black carbon also showed large\ndecreasing rates, indicating the effective emission control of coal\ncombustion and biomass burning. The decreased sulfate contribution and\nincreased nitrate fraction were highly consistent with the much faster\nemission reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) due to phasing out coal in\nBeijing compared to reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions estimated by\nbottom-up inventory. The chemical transport model simulations with these\nemission estimates reproduced the relative changes in aerosol composition\nand suggested that the reduced emissions in Beijing and its surrounding\nregions played a dominant role. The variations in meteorological conditions\nand regional transport contributed much less to the changes in aerosol\nconcentration and its chemical composition during 2014\u20132017 compared to the\ndecreasing emissions. Finally, we speculated that changes in precursor\nemissions possibly altered the aerosol formation mechanisms based on ambient\nobservations. The observed explosive growth of sulfate at a relative\nhumidity (RH) greater than 50\u2009% in 2014 was delayed to a higher RH of\n70\u2009% in 2017, which was likely caused by the suppressed sulfate formation\nthrough heterogeneous reactions due to the decrease in SO2 emissions.\nThermodynamic simulations showed that the decreased sulfate and nitrate\nconcentrations have lowered the aerosol water content, particle acidity, and\nammonium particle fraction. The results in this study demonstrate the\nresponse of aerosol chemistry to the stringent clean air actions and\nidentify that the anthropogenic emission reductions are a major driver,\nwhich could help to further guide air pollution control strategies in China.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "48bfc5912ec6bfb4ba50c653c7185a95fa9399d0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2123627601", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-011-0152-3", "CorpusId": 53973991}, "title": "RCP2.6: exploring the possibility to keep global mean temperature increase below 2\u00b0C", "abstract": "The RCP2.6 emission and concentration pathway is representative of the literature on mitigation scenarios aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2\u00b0C.

This impact study covers the four main energy consuming sectors: transportation, manufacturing, power generation, and residential. Previously published four case studies on passenger cars, trucks and buses, paper machines and the mining industry were included in our detailed calculations as reference data in our current analyses. The following can be concluded:\nIn total, ~23% (119 EJ) of the world\u2019s total energy consumption originates from tribological contacts. Of that 20% (103 EJ) is used to overcome friction and 3% (16 EJ) is used to remanufacture worn parts and spare equipment due to wear and wear-related failures.By taking advantage of the new surface, materials, and lubrication technologies for friction reduction and wear protection in vehicles, machinery and other equipment worldwide, energy losses due to friction and wear could potentially be reduced by 40% in the long term (15 years)and by 18% in the short term (8 years). On global scale, these savings would amount to 1.4% of the GDP annually and 8.7% of the total energy consumption in the long term.The largest short term energy savings are envisioned in transportation (25%) and in the power generation (20%) while the potential savings in the manufacturing and residential sectors are estimated to be ~10%. In the longer terms, the savings would be 55%, 40%, 25%, and 20%, respectively.Implementing advanced tribological technologies can also reduce the CO2 emissions globally by as much as 1,460 MtCO2 and result in 450,000 million Euros cost savings in the short term. In the longer term, the reduction can be 3,140 MtCO2 and the cost savings 970,000 million Euros. Fifty years ago, wear and wear-related failures were a major concern for UK industry and their mitigation was considered to be the major contributor to potential economic savings by as much as 95% in ten years by the development and deployment of new tribological solutions. The corresponding estimated savings are today still of the same orders but the calculated contribution to cost reduction is about 74% by friction reduction and to 26% from better wear protection.

We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions.

Baseline evaluations included complete clinical and laboratory evaluations, exercise stress (ramp treadmill), 2D Doppler echocardiogram, single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion scan, and 24-hour Holter monitoring.

For these measurements a fully automated, computerized sampling and analyzing system was developed which allowed the simultaneous determination of CH4 emission rates at 16 different field plots. CH4 emission rates showed strong diurnal and seasonal variations. Diurnal changes correlated with changes in soil temperature. During the season, CH4 emission rates showed a first maximum in May\u2013June before tillering and a second maximum in July during the reproductive stage of the rice plants. In 1985 and 1986 two maxima were observed during summer in addition to the first maximum in the rate of CH4 emission during spring. Application of mineral and/or organic fertilizer strongly influenced the CH4 emission rates, depending on the type, rate, and mode of fertilizer application. Thus the rates decreased by at most 40% and 60% after fertilization by deep incorporation with 200 kg N/ha urea and 200 kg N/ha ammonium sulfate, respectively. Application of 200 kg N/ha calcium cyanamide led to a reduction of the first maximum of CH4 emission but caused the second maximum to increase, the overall result being that the seasonally averaged CH4 emission rate was comparable to that observed in unfertilized fields. Application of rice straw at a rate of 12 t/ha enhanced the rate of CH4 emission by a factor of 2 compared with the control. Higher application rates of rice straw did not cause a further increase in CH4 emission. The complete records of CH4 emissions over three vegetation periods indicate an average seasonal CH4 emission rate from unfertilized fields of 0.28 g CH4/m2 d, with a range of 0.16\u20130.38 g CH4/m2 d.

Such shocks can erase decades ofhard work and leave people with irreversible human and physical losses.

Absent such good development, many people will still be living in or closeto extreme poverty in 2030, with few resources to cope with climate shocks and adapt to longterm trends, and climate change could increase extreme poverty by more than 100 million people by 2030.

These benefits would be largest in the winter heating season when severe air pollution occurs. Household emissions, mostly from space heating and cooking with solid fuels, are an important and generally unrecognized source of ambient air pollution in China and other developing countries. Alternative fuels and other ways of reducing emissions would have large benefits.

We use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry to evaluate potential residential emission controls in Beijing and in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) region.

Annually burned straw PM2.5 emissions during 1997 ~ 2013 for 31 China provinces were calculated based on crop and related burning information for 12 months based on satellite detection of agricultural burning. Annual emissions from other anthropogenic sources were collected from the literature and allocated to monthly values using air pollution index measurements. The results indicate that the annual PM2.5 emissions from open straw burning in China were 1.036 m tons. The monthly PM2.5 emission ratios of straw burning to other anthropogenic sources during June, the harvest period for many regions, were several times larger than the annual ratios at national, regional, and province levels, suggesting that, in contrast to annual emissions that were used in the PM2.5 inventories in Chinese cities to assess the contributions from other sources, monthly emissions should be used to assess the contributions from straw burning during the harvest or other active burning periods. The larger contributions from straw burning shown in this study also suggest that substantial reduction of open field straw burning would dramatically improve air quality in many Chinese regions during the harvest or other active burning periods.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2be6448fd1095f641ef61697d5c84f900225d98a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1935089707", "DOI": "10.2307/1313296", "CorpusId": 83657305}, "title": "Nitrogen Saturation in Temperate Forest Ecosystems", "abstract": "N itrogen emissions to the atmosphere due to human activity remain elevated in industrialized regions of the world and are accelerating in many developing regions (Galloway 1995).

Arctic haze is a seasonal phenomenon with high concentrations of accumulation-mode aerosols occurring in the Arctic in winter and early spring. Chemistry transport models and climate chemistry models struggle to reproduce this phenomenon, and this has recently prompted changes in aerosol removal schemes to remedy the modeling problems. In this paper, we show that shortcomings in current emission data sets are at least as important. We perform a 3 yr model simulation of black carbon (BC) with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. The model is driven with a new emission data set (\"ECLIPSE emissions\") which includes emissions from gas flaring. While gas flaring is estimated to contribute less than 3% of global BC emissions in this data set, flaring dominates the estimated BC emissions in the Arctic (north of 66\u00b0 N). Putting these emissions into our model, we find that flaring contributes 42% to the annual mean BC surface concentrations in the Arctic. In March, flaring even accounts for 52% of all Arctic BC near the surface. Most of the flaring BC remains close to the surface in the Arctic, so that the flaring contribution to BC in the middle and upper troposphere is small. Another important factor determining simulated BC concentrations is the seasonal variation of BC emissions from residential combustion (often also called domestic combustion, which is used synonymously in this paper). We have calculated daily residential combustion emissions using the heating degree day (HDD) concept based on ambient air temperature and compare results from model simulations using emissions with daily, monthly and annual time resolution. In January, the Arctic-mean surface concentrations of BC due to residential combustion emissions are 150% higher when using daily emissions than when using annually constant emissions. While there are concentration reductions in summer, they are smaller than the winter increases, leading to a systematic increase of annual mean Arctic BC surface concentrations due to residential combustion by 68% when using daily emissions. A large part (93%) of this systematic increase can be captured also when using monthly emissions; the increase is compensated by a decreased BC burden at lower latitudes. In a comparison with BC measurements at six Arctic stations, we find that using daily-varying residential combustion emissions and introducing gas flaring emissions leads to large improvements of the simulated Arctic BC, both in terms of mean concentration levels and simulated seasonality. Case studies based on BC and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from the Zeppelin observatory appear to confirm flaring as an important BC source that can produce pollution plumes in the Arctic with a high BC / CO enhancement ratio, as expected for this source type. BC measurements taken during a research ship cruise in the White, Barents and Kara seas north of the region with strong flaring emissions reveal very high concentrations of the order of 200\u2013400 ng m \u22123 . The model underestimates these concentrations substantially, which indicates that the flaring emissions (and probably also other emissions in northern Siberia) are rather under- than overestimated in our emission data set. Our results suggest that it may not be \"vertical transport that is too strong or scavenging rates that are too low\" and \"opposite biases in these processes\" in the Arctic and elsewhere in current aerosol models, as suggested in a recent review article (Bond et al., Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: a scientific assessment, J.

Agriculture, deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions and local/regional climate change have been closely intertwined in Brazil.

On one hand, this accrues considerable environmental dividends including a pronounced reduction in deforestation (which is becoming decoupled from agricultural production), resulting in a decrease of \u223c40% in nationwide greenhouse gas emissions since 2005, and a potential cooling of the climate at the local scale.

This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane, aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE) for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular. To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years (GTP20) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50 and 80 %, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production, waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs, elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves, agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important. These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5 months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3 months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found for China (1.8 months) and India (11\u201312 months). The climate metrics cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 \u00b1 0.14 K between the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041\u20132050, the warming was reduced by 0.22 \u00b1 0.07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced warming of 0.22 \u00b1 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that non-CH4 SLCPs contribute ~ 22 % to this response and CH4 78 %. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations, which attributed about 90 % of the temperature response to CH4 reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4 SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39\u20130.49) K the largest over the Arctic.

Sulphate-coupled AOM is believed to be mediated by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulphate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria but the underlying mechanism has not yet been resolved. Here we show that zero-valent sulphur compounds (S0) are formed during AOM through a new pathway for dissimilatory sulphate reduction performed by the methanotrophic archaea. Hence, AOM might not be an obligate syntrophic process but may be carried out by the ANME alone. Furthermore, we show that the produced S0\u2014in the form of disulphide\u2014is disproportionated by the Deltaproteobacteria associated with the ANME.

The definition of natural visibility conditions is adequate for current planning, but it will need to be refined as visibility improves.

A large portion of this carbon is in the form of gaseous CO2, and approximately 30% of this CO2 comes from fossil fuel power plants. In addition to rising levels of atmospheric CO2, the earth\u2019s temperature is increasing. Since CO2 can act as a trap for heat (similar to the glass in a greenhouse), reduction of CO2 emissions is an important area of research. Separation and sequestration of CO2 are near-term goals for emissions reduction. Better fuel efficiency (in power production, transportation, and other areas) can be considered a mid-term goal. An acceptable long-term goal for reducing emissions is using alternate power sources such as nuclear, solar, and wind power. Because separation and sequestration are short-term goals, they are critical and challenging steps for researchers. Methods that are reviewed in this paper include absorption using solvents or solid sorbents, pressure- and temperature-swing adsorption using various solid sorbents, cryogenic distillation, membranes, and several novel and emerging technologies. Upon completion of this review, it was concluded that the most promising current method for CO2 separation is liquid absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA). While this method is currently most promising, the development of ceramic and metallic membranes for membrane diffusion should produce membranes significantly more efficient at separation than liquid absorption. The other methods investigated in this report are either too new for comparison or appear unlikely to experience significant changes to make them desirable for implementation.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "0eebe49ea37a7dada164ec3da1b83bb3be5ba2ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2325510615", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aad2705", "CorpusId": 206642623, "PubMed": "26966190"}, "title": "A 21st-century shift from fossil-fuel to biogenic methane emissions indicated by 13CH4", "abstract": "Getting a rise out of agriculture Methane, a powerful and important greenhouse gas, has been accumulating nearly uninterruptedly in the atmosphere for the past 200 years, with the exception of a mysterious plateau between 1999 and 2006. Schaefer et al. measured methane's carbon isotopic composition in samples collected over the past 35 years in order to constrain the cause of the pause. Lower thermogenic emissions or variations in the hydroxyldriven methane sink caused the plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn't resume to cause the subsequent rise. Instead, the ongoing rise is most likely due to biogenic sources, most notably agriculture. Science, this issue p. 80 The atmospheric methane level has resumed its increase after a plateau between 1999 and 2006. Between 1999 and 2006, a plateau interrupted the otherwise continuous increase of atmospheric methane concentration [CH4] since preindustrial times. Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate-sensitive sources. We reconstructed the global history of [CH4] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air, and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH4 sink caused the [CH4] plateau. Thermogenic emissions did not resume to cause the renewed [CH4] rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH4 emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b2f8b7c63892acdf0a2e1c33348fb8ce52c76193", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2777475609", "DOI": "10.1051/ANIMRES:2000119", "CorpusId": 15261783}, "title": "Methane production by ruminants: its contribution to global warming", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to review the role of methane in the global warming scenario and to examine the contribution to atmospheric methane made by enteric fermentation, mainly by rumi- nants. Agricultural emissions of methane in the EU-15 have recently been estimated at 10.2 million tonnes per year and represent the greatest source. Of these, approximately two-thirds come from enteric fermentation and one-third from livestock manure. Fermentation of feeds in the rumen is the largest source of methane from enteric fermentation and this paper considers in detail the reasons for, and the consequences of, the fact that the molar percentage of the different volatile fatty acids pro- duced during fermentation influences the production of methane in the rumen. Acetate and butyrate promote methane production while propionate formation can be considered as a competitive pathway for hydrogen use in the rumen. The many alternative approaches to reducing methane are considered, both in terms of reduction per animal and reduction per unit of animal product. It was concluded that the most promising areas for future research for reducing methanogenesis are the development of new products/delivery systems for anti-methanogenic compounds or alternative electron acceptors in the rumen and reduction in protozoal numbers in the rumen. It is also stressed that the reason ruminants are so important to mankind is that much of the world's biomass is rich in fibre. They can convert this into high quality protein sources (i.e. meat and milk) for human consumption and this will need to be balanced against the concomitant production of methane.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "9db95d808cb4b6af740590944dfa812da56732e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087445190", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2005.02.001", "CorpusId": 154678166}, "title": "Allocation of CO2 emission permits - economic incentives for emission reductions in developing countries.", "abstract": null, "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "2c909e4be39baae549f2e8d8bd42ea3e4e5dc026", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986114579", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2007.08.026", "CorpusId": 154078790}, "title": "Scenario analysis on CO2 emissions reduction potential in China's electricity sector", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "8baea017cef92ce06f3e7a32d066da759a5519e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2138334526", "DOI": "10.3382/JAPR.2007-00076", "CorpusId": 97858315}, "title": "Reduction of Ammonia Emissions from Stored Laying Hen Manure Through Topical Application of Zeolite, Al + Clear, Ferix-3, or Poultry Litter Treatment", "abstract": "SUMMARY Practical means to decrease aerial emissions will enhance the ability of the US egg industry to improve environmental stewardship while continuing to provide consumers safe and affordable eggs. Ammonia emissions from manure-belt laying hen houses have been shown to be less than 10% of the emissions from high-rise counterparts where manure is stored in-house for a year. However, on-farm manure storage for manure-belt houses also emits NH3, which is a part of the total farm emissions. Nevertheless, treating manure in storage sheds to decrease NH3 emissions may be more readily implemented than treatment inside the layer houses because of potential bird health concerns and possible detrimental effects of the treatment on the housing equipment. The laboratory-scale experiments reported here examined the efficacy of 4 commercially available treatment agents, topically applied to laying hen manure at 3 different dosages, in decreasing NH3 emissions from the manure storage. The treatment agents included zeolite, 2 forms of Al + Clear (aluminum sulfate, 48.5% liquid and granular), Ferix-3 (ferric sulfate), and Poultry Litter Treatment (PLT, sodium bisulfate). All the tested agents showed appreciable NH3 emission reduction of 33 to 94%. In all cases, the greatest application dosage provided little additional NH3 reduction as compared with the medium dosage (P > 0.70). Comparison among the dry granular Al + Clear, Ferix-3, and PLT in reduction of NH3 emission over a 7-d manure storage period showed no significant difference when the agents were applied at 0.5 kg/m 2 of manure surface area (P = 0.40) but greater reduction for Al + Clear (92 \u00b1 3%) and Ferix-3 (90 \u00b1 1%) as compared with PLT (81 \u00b1 2%) when applied at 1.0 kg/m 2 (P < 0.01).

Our results show that when using future anticipated costs for wind and solar, carbon dioxide emissions from the US electricity sector can be reduced by up to 80% relative to 1990 levels, without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity. The reductions are possible with current technologies and without electrical storage. Wind and solar power increase their share of electricity production as the system grows to encompass large-scale weather patterns. This reduction in carbon emissions is achieved by moving away from a regionally divided electricity sector to a national system enabled by high-voltage direct-current transmission.
