Replacing fertiliser nitrogen with biologically fixed\nnitrogen (BFN) through legumes has been suggested as a strategy for nitrous\noxide (N2O) mitigation from intensively managed grasslands. While\ncurrent literature provides evidence for an N2O emission reduction\neffect due to reduced fertiliser input, little is known about the effect of\nincreased legume proportions potentially offsetting these reductions, i.e.\nby increased N2O emissions from plant residues and root exudates. In\norder to assess the overall effect of this mitigation strategy on permanent\ngrassland, we performed an in situ experiment and quantified net N2O fluxes\nand biomass yields in two differently managed grass\u2013clover mixtures. We\nmeasured N2O fluxes in an unfertilised parcel with high clover\nproportions vs. an organically fertilised control parcel with low clover\nproportions using the eddy covariance (EC) technique over 2\u00a0years.\nFurthermore, we related the measured N2O fluxes to management and\nenvironmental drivers. To assess the effect of the mitigation strategy, we\nmeasured biomass yields and quantified biologically fixed nitrogen using the\n15N natural abundance method. The amount of BFN was similar in both parcels in 2015 (control: 55\u00b15\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha\u22121\u2009yr\u22121; clover parcel: 72\u00b15\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha\u22121\u2009yr\u22121) due to similar clover proportions (control:\n15\u2009% and clover parcel: 21\u2009%), whereas in 2016 BFN was substantially\nhigher in the clover parcel compared to the much lower control (control: 14\u00b12\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha\u22121\u2009yr\u22121 with 4\u2009% clover in DM; clover\nparcel: 130\u00b18\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha\u22121\u2009yr\u22121 and 44\u2009% clover). The\nmitigation management effectively reduced N2O emissions by 54\u2009%\nand 39\u2009% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, corresponding to 1.0 and\n1.6\u2009t\u2009ha\u22121\u2009yr\u22121\u2009CO2 equivalents. These reductions in\nN2O emissions can be attributed to the absence of fertilisation on\nthe clover parcel. Differences in clover proportions during periods with no\nrecent management showed no measurable effect on N2O emissions,\nindicating that the decomposition of plant residues and rhizodeposition did not\ncompensate for the effect of fertiliser reduction on N2O emissions.\nAnnual biomass yields were similar under mitigation management, resulting in\na reduction of N2O emission intensities from\n0.42\u2009g\u2009N2O-N\u2009kg\u22121\u2009DM (control) to\n0.28\u2009g\u2009N2O-N\u2009kg\u22121\u2009DM (clover parcel) over the 2-year\nobservation period. We conclude that N2O emissions from fertilised\ngrasslands can be effectively reduced without losses in yield by increasing\nthe clover proportion and reducing fertilisation.\n", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3fe5d549a69dbae3bddc288de3fe06ebce291139", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2333470484", "DOI": "10.1021/CM502106V", "CorpusId": 101988366}, "title": "Mesoporous Co3O4 with Controlled Porosity: Inverse Micelle Synthesis and High-Performance Catalytic CO Oxidation at \u221260 \u00b0C", "abstract": "Crystalline mesoporous cobalt oxides with improved catalytic activity in CO oxidation were synthesized using an inverse surfactant micelle method.

Zinc sulfide-catalyzed photoreduction of aldehydes and related derivatives: two-electron-transfer reduction and relationship with spectroscopic properties", "abstract": "Photocatalytic activity and spectroscopic properties of ZnS suspensions for the two-electron reduction of aldehydes or related compounds in aqueous medium are described. The ZnS suspension (ZnS-O) prepared by cooling from aqueous ZnSO{sub 4} and Na{sub 2}S solutions catalyzes photoredox reactions of acetaldehyde, giving ethanol without much H{sub 2} evolution as a two-electron-reduction product, and acetic acid, biacetyl, and acetoin as oxidation products. When the ZnS-O suspension is refluxed (giving ZnS-100) or dried to powder, the resulting ZnS shows an increased activity for H{sub 2} evolution but a decreased activity for the two-electron reduction. The two-electron photoreduction is ascribed to the sequential transfer of active electrons in the conduction band of defect-free aggregates of ZnS microcrystallites (quantized ZnS). This mechanism is supported by product analysis, energetics at ZnS interfaces, the sharp and blue-shifted onset of absorption and excitation spectra, and the long-life band gap emission of the active ZnS-O suspension. UV, emission, and ESR spectra, as well as the enhancement of the particle size and crystallinity, suggest that the activity change observed after heating or drying to powder is due to the formation of surface states which may trap active electrons.

Methods: An area was identified where certain streets were subject to air pollution from heavy road traffic, which was likely to improve following the construction of a by-pass. A respiratory survey was conducted among the residents, together with the residents of nearby uncongested streets, at baseline and again a year after the by-pass opened.

PM10 decreased by 23% (8.0 \u03bcg/m3) in the congested streets and by 29% (3.4 \u03bcg/m3) in the uncongested streets, with similar proportionate falls in PM2.5.

Moreover, because border adjustments involve both tariffs and export rebates, it is the differences in emissions intensity across sector rather than emissions level which matters. Where there is no difference in emissions intensities across sectors, Lerner symmetry holds for the border adjustment and no relative effects occur. In our numerical simulation analyses border tax adjustments accompany carbon emission reduction commitments made either unilaterally , or as part of a global treaty and to be applied against non signatories. We use a four-region (US, EU, China, ROW) general equilibrium structure which captures energy trade and has endogenously determined energy supply so that global emissions can change with policy changes.

Results indicate only small impacts of these measures on global emissions, trade and welfare, but the signs of effects are as expected. BTAs alleviate leakage effects as expected.

In this review article, the current understanding of the influence of emission reductions on atmospheric pollutant concentrations and air quality is summarized for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), ammonia, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide (CO). In the first 7 months following the onset of the pandemic, more than 200 papers were accepted by peer-reviewed journals utilizing observations from ground-based and satellite instruments. Only about one-third of this literature incorporates a specific method for meteorological correction or normalization for comparing data from the lockdown period with prior reference observations despite the importance of doing so on the interpretation of results. We use the government stringency index (SI) as an indicator for the severity of lockdown measures and show how key air pollutants change as the SI increases. The observed decrease of NO2 with increasing SI is in general agreement with emission inventories that account for the lockdown. Other compounds such as O3, PM2.5, and CO are also broadly covered. Due to the importance of atmospheric chemistry on O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, their responses may not be linear with respect to primary pollutants. At most sites, we found O3 increased, whereas PM2.5 decreased slightly, with increasing SI. Changes of other compounds are found to be understudied. We highlight future research needs for utilizing the emerging data sets as a preview of a future state of the atmosphere in a world with targeted permanent reductions of emissions.

The growth of combustion chamber deposits (CCD) is a dynamic and, to an extent, reversible process which at any given time reflects the balance between the formation and removal processes. Engine surface temperature is the most important parameter that affects their formation and changes in engine operation which tend to increase surface temperature, reduce deposit growth. At a fixed temperature, less volatile fuels tend to form more deposits than more volatile fuels. Some detergent additive packages tend to increase CCD levels. CCD reduce the heat lost to the coolant and increase charge temperature thereby increasing flame propagation rates but reducing volumetric efficiency; they might also affect the final phase of combustion by as yet undefined chemical means. This is reflected as an increase in octane requirement and NOx and a reduction in maximum power but an improvement in fuel economy and a reduction in CO2 emissions. They might also lead to higher HC emissions but not necessarily always since there might be competing mechanisms which come into play. CCD effect on CO emissions is not clearly established. They can also cause other interference problems like carbon rap. It is not known to what extent engine performance is affected by small changes in CCD levels. There is a large variation in deposit growth and its response to changes in fuel, additives and engine operating conditions across the combustion chamber and between different engines. Similarly, the performance of different engines will be affected to different extents by the deposits.

A field study was conducted to investigate the effects of water management practices on CH4 emission from rice field plots on a silty sand Aeric Tropaquept soil at Research Station for Agricultural Environment Preservation, Jakenan, Central Java, Indonesia, during the dry season of March to June 2002. Four water regimes tested were: (1) 5 cm continuous flooding (CF), (2) 0-1 cm continuous flooding (ST), (3) intermittent irrigation (IR) where plots received continuously 5 cm of flooding with two times of draining at 15-20 and 25-30 days after transplanting (DAT), and (4) pulse irrigation (PI) where plots were watered until 5 cm level and left to dry by itself until the water table reached 30 cm beneath soil surface then watered again. The total CH4 emissions of the four water treatments were 254, 185, 136 and 96 kg CH4 ha -1 for CF, ST, IR and PI, respectively. Methane emission increased during the early growing season, which coincided with the low redox potential of -100 to -150 mV in all treatments. Dry matter weight of straw and filled grain among the water treatments did not show significant differences. Likewise, total grain yield at 14% moisture content was not significantly different among treatments. However, this result should be carefully interpreted because the rice plants in all water treatments were infested by stem borer, which reduced the total grain yield of IR64 between 11% and 16%.

The Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region has been suffering from the most severe fine-particle (PM2.\u20095) pollution in China, which causes serious health damage and economic loss. Quantifying the source contributions to PM2.\u20095 concentrations has been a challenging task because of the complicated nonlinear relationships between PM2.\u20095 concentrations and emissions of multiple pollutants from multiple spatial regions and economic sectors. In this study, we use the extended response surface modeling (ERSM) technique to investigate the nonlinear response of PM2.\u20095 concentrations to emissions of multiple pollutants from different regions and sectors over the BTH region, based on over 1000 simulations by a chemical transport model (CTM). The ERSM-predicted PM2.\u20095 concentrations agree well with independent CTM simulations, with correlation coefficients larger than 0.99 and mean normalized errors less than 1\u202f%. Using the ERSM technique, we find that, among all air pollutants, primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 makes the largest contribution (24\u201336\u202f%) to PM2.\u20095 concentrations. The contribution of primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 emissions is especially high in heavily polluted winter and is dominated by the industry as well as residential and commercial sectors, which should be prioritized in PM2.\u20095 control strategies. The total contributions of all precursors (nitrogen oxides, NOx; sulfur dioxides, SO2; ammonia, NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; intermediate-volatility organic compounds, IVOCs; primary organic aerosol, POA) to PM2.\u20095 concentrations range between 31 and 48\u202f%. Among these precursors, PM2.\u20095 concentrations are primarily sensitive to the emissions of NH3, NMVOC\u202f+\u202fIVOC, and POA. The sensitivities increase substantially for NH3 and NOx and decrease slightly for POA and NMVOC\u202f+\u202fIVOC with the increase in the emission reduction ratio, which illustrates the nonlinear relationships between precursor emissions and PM2.\u20095 concentrations. The contributions of primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 emissions to PM2.\u20095 concentrations are dominated by local emission sources, which account for over 75\u202f% of the total primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 contributions. For precursors, however, emissions from other regions could play similar roles to local emission sources in the summer and over the northern part of BTH.

In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires.

Such a strategy could evolve from current single-pollutant regulatory practices using a series of steps that would seek to minimize risk of exposure for humans and ecosystems while providing for a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of the management process. The tools needed to support multipollutant air quality management are summarized. They include application of a formal risk analysis, accounting for atmospheric processes, ambient measurements, emissions characterization, air quality modeling of emissions to ambient concentrations, and characterization of human and ecological responses to ambient pollutant exposure. The new management strategy would expand the current practice of accountability that relates emission reductions and attainment of air quality derived from air quality criteria and standards. Conceptually, achievement of accountability would establish goals optimizing risk reduction associated with pollution management. This expanded approach takes into account the sequence of processes from emissions reduction to resulting changes in ambient concentration. Using ambient concentration as a proxy for exposure, the resulting improvement in human and ecosystem health is estimated. The degree to which this chain of processes and effects can be achieved in current practice is examined in a multipollutant context exemplified by oxidants, as indicated by ozone, particulate matter, and some hazardous air pollutants.

Second, capture the benefits inherent in the use of ETC technology by undertaking a comparative analysis of pre-ETC and post-ETC scenarios. The primary measures of effectiveness used are (1) increased throughput and hence reduced wait time at the toll plazas; and (2) reduced mobile emissions [hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxide (NO\\d\\ix)]. It was determined from the simulation and mobile emissions models that the current deployment level of M-Tag has improved the average travel speed by more than 125% and has decreased the mobile emissions rate by up to 41% at the Fort McHenry Tunnel toll plaza.

The levy experience has not been studied systematically, but anecdotal critiques have suggested that the system is arbitrarily administered and ineffective in controlling pollution. Enforcement is thought to vary widely, so that factories in different regions face different penalties for polluting. And it is widely believed that the levy provides little incentive to control pollution because official rates are below marginal abatement costs. The authors test the conventional critique of the levy system using solid new province-level data for 1987-93. Their results suggest that the water pollution levy system is neither arbitrary nor ineffective. During 1987-93, rapid development in many provinces led to sharp increases in the effective rate. Their results also suggest that the emissions intensity of Chinese industry was highly responsive to those increases, because marginal abatement costs were often lower than levy rates. And from 1987 to 1993, provincial pollution intensities fell at a median rate of 50 percent, and total discharges at a median rate of 22 percent. The results suggest several lessons for regulators in developing countries: 1) local enforcement of national standards will determine the effective price of pollution in each area; 2) the locally enforced price of pollution rises with industrial development; and 3) early in the regulatory process, industrial emissions intensity is highly responsive to changes in the price of pollution, mainly because marginal costs are often quite low in low to medium abatement ranges.

The value for the recovery of heart rate was defined as the decrease in the heart rate from peak exercise to one minute after the cessation of exercise.

The origins of three such problems, the atmospheric deposition of N compounds, the leaching of nitrates to ground-water and the anthropogenic N-input to the North Sea, are investigated by means of a Substance Flow Analysis (SFA); the reference year is 1988. Although the problems occur at various scales and have varying direct causes, food production and consumption together are the main responsible sectors, and the production and import of fertilizer appear to be the major ultimate sources in all three cases. Measures to combat these problems have been agreed to in various international frameworks: the European Community, the International North Sea Conference and the Rhine States Conference. These measures include technical emission reduction for acidifying compounds resulting in a 30% emission reduction; extension of the sewage treatment network and application of denitrification with 50% effectiveness; and introduction of measures directed at efficiency increase and emission reduction in agricultural practice in 10% of the agricultural area. The recent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are not expected to lead to significant changes in N flows.

The leaching of nitrates to the ground-water is expected to remain at the current level or even to increase a little.

Across the sample, there was a factor of six in carbon dioxide emissions per unit floor area, and even more per occupant. The air-conditioned buildings tended to use the most energy: they usually contained more equipment, were more intensively occupied, but also usually ran more liberally and wastefully \u2013 as did more complex systems generally. Often complication seemed to have been added before the fundamentals had been made efficient. Design objectives were also frustrated by poor airtightness, control problems, unintended consequences, a dearth of energy management, and a tendency for systems to default to \u2018on\u2019 - also a pathological trend for information technology and its associated cooling demands.

In these notes I suggest a way to exploit this approach to limiting accumulations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The ?service? that produces the control is the reduction, by nations, in the levels of emissions over time from what they would otherwise choose, also known as the ?business as usual? emissions path. In the scheme as envisioned, which could be used in a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, the fact that all nations are sellers of reductions ameliorates the enforcement problems typical of commitments to particular emission paths. Another difference from the Kyoto-style system: In the scheme sketched here, the distributive of burdens is explicit, rather than implicit in the allowable emission amounts.

Combustion performance and exhaust emissions of using the fuel have been measured from no load up to full load engine condition. For comparison diesel fuel JIS#2 have been used. SVO gives higher NOx but lower smoke emissions at high load compared with JIS#2. Lower smoke emissions at high load is due to oxygen content in the SVO that can eliminate partially unburned fuel at stratified fuel rich zone during combustion. Enhanced combustion raises the temperature inside the combustion chamber and caused higher NOx emission. In addition of using SVO as fuel, this study also had blend several percentages of ethanol into SVO with the presence of octanol as surfactant. As percentage of ethanol increased in this SVO-ethanol blend, smoke and particulate emissions reduced with unchanged NOx level. This is because the reduction of kinematic viscosity of SVO-ethanol blend improves the atomization and vaporization of injected fuel droplets that leads to lower particulate emission. Simultaneous reduction of NOx and particulate emissions can be obtained by transform the SVO into an emulsion fuel by blending some percentages of water into SVO with existence of castor oil as surfactant. Evaporation of water during combustion reduces the combustion temperature and causes the reduction of NOx emission. Reduction of particulate emission is due to water gas reaction.

This paper considers the economic case for such support. Using recent data on emissions, program effectiveness and program costs, we estimate the cost of carbon emissions abatement via family planning and female education. We compare our estimates with the costs of numerous technical abatement options that have been estimated by Naucler and Enkvist in a major study for McKinsey and Company (2009). We find that the population policy options are much less costly than almost all of the options Naucler and Enkvist provide for low-carbon energy development, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, second-generation biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. They are also cost-competitive with forest conservation and other improvments in forestry and agricultural practices.

Here we calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with the invasion of an agricultural pest from Asia to North America. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first discovered in North America in 2000, and has led to a substantial increase in insecticide use in soybeans. We estimate that the manufacture, transport, and application of insecticides against soybean aphid results in approximately 10.6 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent greenhouse gasses being emitted per hectare of soybeans treated. Given the acreage sprayed, this has led to annual emissions of between 6 and 40 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses in the United States since the invasion of soybean aphid, depending on pest population size. Emissions would be higher were it not for the development of a threshold aphid density below which farmers are advised not to spray. Without a threshold, farmers tend to spray preemptively and the threshold allows farmers to take advantage of naturally occurring biological control of the soybean aphid, which can be substantial. We find that adoption of the soybean aphid economic threshold can lead to emission reductions of approximately 300 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year in the United States. Previous studies have documented that biological control agents such as lady beetles are capable of suppressing aphid densities below this threshold in over half of the soybean acreage in the U.S. Given the acreages involved this suggests that biological control results in annual emission reductions of over 200 million kg of CO2 equivalents.

Sixteen MS subjects were restudied after 6 weeks of very low calorie diet intervention.

Describing catalyst features that control the selectivity of these two pathways is important to determine the formation of specific products. At the same time, identification of morphological changes occurring to catalysts under reaction conditions can be crucial to tune their catalytic performance. In this contribution we investigate the dependency of selectivity for CO2 reduction on the size of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and on support. We find that even at rather low temperatures (210 \u00b0C), oxidative pretreatment induces redispersion of Ru NPs supported on CeO2 and leads to a complete switch in the performance of this material from a well-known selective methanation catalyst to an active and selective RWGS catalyst. By utilizing in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the low-temperature redispersion process occurs via decomposition of the metal oxide phase with size-dependent kinetics, producing stable single-site RuO x/CeO2 species strongly bound to the CeO2 support that are remarkably selective for CO production.

A series of long-term and temporary measurements were conducted to study the improvement of air quality in Beijing during the Olympic Games period (8\u201324 August 2008). To evaluate actions taken to improve the air quality, comparisons of particle number and volume size distributions of August 2008 and 2004\u20132007 were performed. The total particle number and volume concentrations were 14 000 cm \u22123 and 37 \u03bcm \u22123 cm \u22123 in August of 2008, respectively. These were reductions of 41% and 35% compared with mean values of August 2004\u20132007. A cluster analysis on air mass history and source apportionment were performed, exploring reasons for the reduction of particle concentrations. Back trajectories were classified into five major clusters. Air masses from the south direction are always associated with pollution events during the summertime in Beijing. In August 2008, the frequency of air mass arriving from the south was 1.3 times higher compared to the average of the previous years, which however did not result in elevated particle volume concentrations in Beijing. Therefore, the reduced particle number and volume concentrations during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games cannot be only explained by meteorological conditions. Four factors were found influencing particle concentrations using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. They were identified as local and remote traffic emissions, combustion sources as well as secondary transformation. The reductions of the four sources were calculated to 47%, 44%, 43% and 30%, respectively.

Significant reductions in energy and emissions are derived from the decrease of energy-intensive production with virgin materials. In many cities, competing priorities can lead to limited consideration given to system optimal collection and processing strategies that can drive down costs and increase revenue while simultaneously reducing system energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We evaluate three alterations to a hypothetical California city's recycling network to discern the conditions under which the changes.constitute system improvements to cost, energy, and emissions. The system initially operates with a collection zoning scheme that does not mitigate the impact of seasonal variations in consumer tonnage. In addition, two collection organizations operate redundantly, collecting recyclables from different customer types on the same street network. Finally, the system is dual stream, meaning recyclables are separated at the curbside. In some scenarios, this practice can limit the consumer participation rate leading to lower collection quantities. First, we evaluate a \"business as usual\" (BAU) scenario and find that the system operates at a $1.7 M/yr loss but still avoids a net 18.7 GJ and 1700 kg of greenhouse gas equivalent (GGE) per ton of material recycled. Second, we apply an alternative zoning scheme for collection that creates a uniform daily pickup demand throughout the year reducing costs by $0.2 M/yr, energy by 30 MJ/ton, and GHG emissions by 2 kg GGE/ton. Next, the two collection organizations are consolidated into a single entity further reducing vehicle fleet size and weekly vehicle miles traveled resulting in savings from BAU of $0.3 M/yr, 100 MJ/ton, and 8 kg GGE/ton. Lastly, we evaluate a switch to a single-stream system (where recyclables are commingled). We showthat single-stream recycling can increase the total amount of material collected to a degree that lowers overall net cost ($0.2 M/yr) and leads to further reductions in energy use (210 MJ/ton) and emissions(16 kg GGEton).

This paper outlines the history and relevance of the IPCC for building services engineers as well as reviewing the world trends in carbon emissions from buildings and the future scenarios on which they are based.

We quantify the global and regional precipitation responses to U.S. SO2 emission reductions using three fully coupled chemistry\u2010climate models: Community Earth System Model version 1, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model 3, and Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE2. We contrast 200 year (or longer) simulations in which anthropogenic U.S. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are set to zero with present\u2010day control simulations to assess the aerosol, cloud, and precipitation response to U.S. SO2 reductions. In all three models, reductions in aerosol optical depth up to 70% and cloud droplet number column concentration up to 60% occur over the eastern U.S. and extend over the Atlantic Ocean. Precipitation responses occur both locally and remotely, with the models consistently showing an increase in most regions considered. We find a northward shift of the tropical rain belt location of up to 0.35\u00b0 latitude especially near the Sahel, where the rainy season length and intensity are significantly enhanced in two of the three models. This enhancement is the result of greater warming in the Northern versus Southern Hemispheres, which acts to shift the Intertropical Convergence Zone northward, delivering additional wet season rainfall to the Sahel. Two of our three models thus imply a previously unconsidered benefit of continued U.S. SO2 reductions for Sahel precipitation.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "9a319c4d93291a8f340aa115b2c3816f054246e0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2269080600", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2014.953908", "CorpusId": 53377376}, "title": "Marginal abatement cost curves and the quality of emission reductions: a case study on Brazil", "abstract": "Decision makers facing emission-reduction targets need to decide which abatement measures to implement, and in which order. This article investigates how marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves can inform such a decision. We re-analyse a MAC curve built for Brazil by 2030, and show that misinterpreting MAC curves as abatement supply curves can lead to suboptimal strategies. It would lead to (1) under-investment in expensive, long-to-implement and large-potential options, such as clean transportation infrastructure, and (2) over-investment in cheap but limited-potential options such as energy-efficiency improvement in refineries. To mitigate this issue, the article proposes a new graphical representation of MAC curves that explicitly renders the time required to implement each measure. Policy relevance In addition to the cost and potential of available options, designing optimal short-term policies requires information on long-term targets (e.g. halving emissions by 2050) and on the speed at which measures can deliver emission reductions. Mitigation policies are thus best investigated in a dynamic framework, building on sector-scale pathways to long-term targets. Climate policies should seek both quantity and quality of abatement, by combining two approaches: a \u2018synergy approach\u2019 that focuses on the cheapest mitigation options and maximizes co-benefits, and an \u2018urgency approach\u2019 that starts from a long-term objective and works backward to identify actions that need to be implemented early. Accordingly, sector-specific policies may be used (1) to remove implementation barriers on negative- and low-cost options and (2) to ensure short-term targets are met with abatement of sufficient quality. Indeed, such policies can avoid under-investment in the long-to-implement options required to reach long-term targets, which are otherwise difficult to enforce.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "3e57212371b6e288d3be06c92a3ec70e0822394f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2076104241", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.61.5.559", "CorpusId": 33046216, "PubMed": "21608496"}, "title": "Photochemical Modeling in California with Two Chemical Mechanisms: Model Intercomparison and Response to Emission Reductions", "abstract": "ABSTRACT An updated version of the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) chemical mechanism (SAPRC07C) was implemented into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) version 4.6. CMAQ simulations using SAPRC07C and the previously released version, SAPRC99, were performed and compared for an episode during July\u2013 August, 2000. Ozone (O3) predictions of the SAPRC07C simulation are generally lower than those of the SAPRC99 simulation in the key areas of central and southern California, especially in areas where modeled concentrations are greater than the federal 8-hr O3 standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) and/or when the volatile organic compound (VOC)/nitrogen oxides (NOx) ratio is less than 13. The relative changes of ozone production efficiency (OPE) against the VOC/NOx ratio at 46 sites indicate that the OPE is reduced in SAPRC07C compared with SAPRC99 at most sites by as much as approximately 22%. The SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C mechanisms respond similarly to 20% reductions in anthropogenic VOC emissions. The response of the mechanisms to 20% NOx emissions reductions can be grouped into three cases. In case 1, in which both mechanisms show a decrease in daily maximum 8-hr O3 concentration with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 decrease in SAPRC07C is smaller. In case 2, in which both mechanisms show an increase in O3 with decreasing NOx emissions, the O3 increase is larger in SAPRC07C. In case 3, SAPRC07C simulates an increase in O3 in response to reduced NOx emissions whereas SAPRC99 simulates a decrease in O3 for the same region. As a result, the areas where NOx controls would be disbeneficial are spatially expanded in SAPRC07C. Although the results presented here are valuable for understanding differences in predictions and model response for SAPRC99 and SAPRC07C, the study did not evaluate the impact of mechanism differences in the context of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance for using numerical models in demonstrating air quality attainment. Therefore, additional study is required to evaluate the full regulatory implications of upgrading air quality models to SAPRC07. IMPLICATIONS CMAQ simulations of gas-phase pollutants over California were conducted using the newly released SAPRC07C gas-phase chemical mechanism and the previous released version, SAPRC99. SAPRC07C predicted slightly lower concentrations of O3 and important radical species than did SAPRC99 in key polluted regions of California. In certain regions, SAPRC07C simulates an increase in O3 in response to 20% reductions in NOx emissions, whereas SAPRC99 simulates a decrease in O3. A consequence of this difference is that areas where NOx controls would be disbeneficial are spatially expanded for SAPRC07C compared with SAPRC99.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "c4dbe7a364bec62ac712d788a371ba47ff69d0bb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992453574", "DOI": "10.3763/cpol.2008.0591", "CorpusId": 153765490}, "title": "An assessment of the climate change policies and performance of large European companies", "abstract": "How are large companies responding to the challenges of reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions? An analysis of the published climate change policies and performance of 125 large European companies is presented. The results suggest that most large European companies have now developed the management systems and processes necessary for them to effectively manage their GHG emissions and related business risks. However, there is a significant disconnect between the targets that companies set for themselves and the more ambitious targets being set by the European Union (which has committed to a 20% reduction in its emissions by 2020 against a 1990 baseline). Of the companies surveyed, just over one-third had stabilized or reduced their total GHG emissions over the period 2002\u20132007, and fewer than one-third expected their emissions to stabilize or reduce in the coming years. The relationship between the quality of corporate policies and performance outcomes (in terms of GHG emissions) suggests that while companies with stronger policies are likely to have relatively better performance, only a minority of those companies with the highest-quality policies are committing to absolute reductions in their GHG emissions.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "727532684e40476be0362ac3852ef7d2177a47b7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120369176", "DOI": "10.1039/B109893D", "CorpusId": 97969328}, "title": "Microspectroscopy at a moving reduction front in zirconia solid electrolyte", "abstract": "Employing photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) and scanning photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) the surface reduction of zirconia solid electrolyte under cathodic polarisation has been observed in situ.
