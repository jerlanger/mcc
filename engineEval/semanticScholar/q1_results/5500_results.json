One of these is the Kyoto Protocol, which contains provisions for emissions reductions by trading carbon through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM is a market-based instrument that allows companies in Annex I countries to offset their greenhouse gas emissions through energy and tree offset projects in the global South. I set out to examine the governance challenges posed by the institutional design of carbon sequestration projects under the CDM. I examine three global narratives associated with the design of CDM forest projects, specifically North\u2013South knowledge politics, green developmentalism, and community participation, and subsequently assess how these narratives match with local practices in two projects in Latin America. Findings suggest that governance problems are operating at multiple levels and that the rhetoric of global carbon actors often asserts these schemes in one light, while the rhetoric of those who are immediately involved locally may be different. I also stress the alarmist's discourse that blames local people for the problems of environmental change. The case studies illustrate the need for vertical communication and interaction and nested governance arrangements as well as horizontal arrangements. I conclude that the global framing of forests as offsets requires better integration of local relationships to forests and their management and more effective institutions at multiple levels to link the very local to the very large scale when dealing with carbon sequestration in the CDM.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "62f29ce5adf0edda4ae20d4701b6b4a6d60d2be2", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3847209", "MAG": "2111151008", "DOI": "10.1186/1472-6785-13-32", "CorpusId": 6689096, "PubMed": "24010540"}, "title": "Methane transport and emissions from soil as affected by water table and vascular plants", "abstract": "BackgroundThe important greenhouse gas (GHG) methane is produced naturally in anaerobic wetland soils. By affecting the production, oxidation and transport of methane to the atmosphere, plants have a major influence upon the quantities emitted by wetlands. Different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited. Here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions. To quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants (the chimney effect), we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.ResultsWe found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant (i.e. bare soil). Species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass. Emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.ConclusionsWe conclude that plant species (and functional groups) vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere. However, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane. A shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "24aceeefe0b186624e514c54e46811bab3f6ab02", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1993267280", "DOI": "10.1103/PHYSREVB.2.4432", "CorpusId": 119592941}, "title": "Infrared Excitation of Visible Luminescence in Y 1 \u2212 x Er x F 3 via Resonant Energy Transfer", "abstract": "The temperature and concentration dependences of the visible emission of ${\\mathrm{Er}}^{3+}$ in Y${\\mathrm{F}}_{3}$ under infrared excitation of the $^{4}I_{\\frac{11}{2}}$ levels have been measured.

A number of indicators have been proposed to reflect comparability of effort and differences in national circumstances; key amongst these are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (per capita), GDP per capita, as well as GHG mitigation potential. This paper focuses on mitigation potential to provide a comparative assessment between six OECD member economies: Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico and the US. GHG mitigation potential is defined to be the level of GHG emission reductions that could be realised, relative to the projected emission baseline in a given year, for a given carbon price. Data for the selected countries were obtained across the time horizon of 2005-2050 from a total of 19 models, including models that are used to inform climate policy-makers in each of these economies. The paper examines the implications of model structure, and assesses how baseline scenarios vary between the models, before analysing the GHG mitigation potential estimates. GHG mitigation potential is compared for carbon prices of USD 20, 50 and 100/tCO2e. For an assumed carbon price of USD 50/tCO2e, mitigation potential in Japan is estimated to be relatively lower than for the other five economies, ranging from 5-20% emission reduction from baseline in 2020. Although noticeably fewer models report data for Mexico at this price level, the models show deeper potential reductions in the range of 25-37% at the same carbon price. Mitigation potential estimates for Australia, Canada and the US show a wider range of 14-39% reduction relative to 2020 baselines. The EU shows a relatively tighter range of 16-29% emission reductions to 2020. The results of this study show greater emission reduction potentials in the year 2050 than in the year 2020 across the six economies examined, reflecting structural and technical changes that occur over time, including the availability of carbon capture and storage from 2030. In general, the paper finds closer agreement across the models for mitigation potential in 2020 than for later years, reflecting greater uncertainty as projections extend into the future. La question de la comparabilite des objectifs fixes par les differents pays en matiere d\u2019attenuation, et des mesures prises pour les atteindre, reste d\u2019actualite dans les negociations internationales sur le climat. Une serie d\u2019indicateurs ont ete proposes pour evaluer la possibilite de comparer les efforts deployes et les disparites dues aux specificites nationales ; parmi ces indicateurs figurent, au premier chef, les emissions de gaz a effet de serre (GES) par habitant, le PIB par habitant et le potentiel d\u2019attenuation des GES. La presente etude s\u2019interesse principalement a ce dernier facteur et livre une comparaison entre six economies de l\u2019OCDE : Australie, Canada, Etats-Unis, Japon, Mexique et Union europeenne. Par potentiel d\u2019attenuation, on entend le niveau de reduction des emissions de GES qu\u2019il a ete possible d\u2019atteindre, par rapport aux quantites d\u2019emissions prevues dans le scenario de reference pour une annee donnee, et pour un prix donne du carbone. Les donnees relatives aux pays choisis ont ete obtenues pour la periode 2005-2050, a partir de 19 modeles au total, dont certains servent a informer les responsables des politiques climatiques de ces economies. Le document examine les implications de la structure des modeles, ainsi que les variations entre les scenarios de reference des differents modeles, avant d\u2019analyser les estimations du potentiel d\u2019attenuation des GES. La comparaison entre les potentiels d\u2019attenuation des GES se fonde sur des prix du carbone fixes a 20, 50 et 100 USD/t eq. CO2. Pour un prix etabli a 50 USD/t eq. CO2, on estime que ce potentiel est plus faible au Japon que dans les cinq autres economies, ou la reduction des emissions devrait se situer en 2020 entre 5 et 20 % par rapport au scenario de reference. Les modeles fournissant des donnees sur le Mexique -- sensiblement moins nombreux pour ce niveau de prix -- font apparaitre des possibilites de reduction plus importantes, comprises entre 25 et 37 % pour un prix identique du carbone. Les estimations effectuees pour l\u2019Australie, le Canada et les Etats-Unis revelent une fourchette plus large, le potentiel de reduction allant de 14 a 39 % par rapport aux scenarios de reference pour 2020. S\u2019agissant de l\u2019UE, l\u2019eventail est relativement plus resserre, puisque les reductions se situent entre 16 et 29 % a l\u2019horizon 2020. Les conclusions de cette etude font ressortir un potentiel de reduction des emissions plus eleve en 2050 qu\u2019en 2020 pour les six economies considerees, en raison d\u2019evolutions structurelles et techniques intervenant au fil du temps, et notamment gr\u00e2ce a la possibilite de pieger et de stocker le carbone a partir de 2030. De maniere generale, le document montre que les modeles relatifs au potentiel d\u2019attenuation presentent davantage de points communs en 2020 que dans les annees ulterieures, signe que les incertitudes sont plus marquees des lors que les projections portent sur des periodes plus eloignees.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "82b5e3c29755ef5e9f80c139495f0127a07dcb03", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147678713", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehp396", "CorpusId": 14063202, "PubMed": "19797329"}, "title": "Abnormal myocardial insulin signalling in type 2 diabetes and left-ventricular dysfunction.", "abstract": "AIMS\nWhole body and myocardial insulin resistance are features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD).

Electricity supply options are wind, gas turbine, BES, and a generic dispatchable-zero-carbon (DZC) source as a proxy for fossil fuel plants with carbon capture or nuclear plants.

We examine sensitivity of the electricity cost to storage performance under a range of emissions constraints. Availability of inexpensive BES systems in general and particularly electrochemical technologies has a small impact on the overall cost of decarbonization. Proportional reductions in capital costs of wind and DZC lower decarbonization costs far more. We find no economic justification for seasonal storage. Intermittent renewables can be used to decarbonize the electricity supply with a proportionally small requirement for BES because gas provides much of the intermittency management even when the carbon emissions intensity is cut to less than 30% of today's U.S. average.

Together with sulphur dioxide (SO2), emissions of nitrogen oxides are the main causes of acidification, which results in widespread damage to vegetation in forests and lakes. In addition, nitrogen oxides contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which has adverse effects on vegetation and human health, and they are a main cause of eutrophication in forest soils and on sea beds. Emissions of nitrogen oxides are connected to several of the 15 national environmental quality objectives, such as Natural acidification only and Zero eutrophication. The acidification objective has an interim target, stating that emissions of nitrogen oxides are to be reduced to 148 000 tonnes per year by 2010. This is in line with the EC Air Quality Directive and would mean a 56 per cent reduction compared to 1990 levels. Emissions are also regulated in the UNECECLRTAP Protocol to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone. In the 1980s acidification was a major problem in Sweden. In 1985, the Swedish Parliament decided that airborne emissions of nitrogen oxides should be reduced by 30 per cent by 1995, compared to 1980 levels. In line with proposals put forward by the Swedish Environmental Charges Commission in the late 1980s, a charge on emissions of nitrogen oxides from energy generation at combustion plants was introduced on 1 January 1992.

E. Cravens (1997, Geophys. Res. Lett. 24, 105\u2013108). Very small attogram particles were detected in Comet Halley by N. G. Utterback and J. Kissel (1990, Astron. J. 100, 1315\u20131322) using the PUMA and PIA dust analyzers from the Vega and Giotto spacecraft. Of all these processes, only scattering by very small particles and charge transfer of the solar-wind heavy ions are capable of producing the measured soft X-ray emission. In the case of very small particles, the mean particle mass of 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u221219 g suggested by Utterback and Kissel implies that the total production of these particles, which exceeds that of gas by a factor 3.6 (in mass), is inconsistent with the polarization and color of Comet Halley. Both polarization and color require a reduction of the mean mass to (1\u20132) \u00d7 10 \u221219 g. This reduction strongly affects the visible brightness of the particles, which is proportional to m 2 , with a relatively weak effect on the soft X-ray emission.

The recorded Tsurf dependence, obtained in a series of 34 identical discharges with ratch-up of Tsurf by plasma impact and inertial cooling after the discharge, revealed that the reduction of BeD is correlated with an increase of D2 emission.

We find that the increase in crop prices under the RFS is likely to be less than 20% in most cases and this increase is much smaller when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy since these policies induce a switch away from corn ethanol to cellulosic biofuels. The impact of the RFS on GHG emissions reduction in the U.S. is fairly modest in size but increases when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy.

Both scenarios required assumptions about the future course of numerous factors such as population growth, technical change and non-climate policies like taxes. Approach: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of unanticipated macroeconomic shocks to growth in developing countries or a global financial crisis o n the performance of three climate policy regimes: A globally-harmonized carbon tax; a global cap and tr ade system and the McKibbin-Wilcoxen hybrid. The G-cubed dynamic general equilibrium model has been used to explore how the shocks would affect emissions, prices, incomes and wealth under each regime. Results: It has been found that a global cap and trade regime will significantly chan ge the way growth shocks will otherwise be transmitted between regions while price-based syste ms such as a global carbon tax or a hybrid policy will not. Moreover, in case of a financial meltdown , a price based system will enable significant emissions reductions at low economic cost whereas a quantity target base system will lead to loss of the opportunity for low cost emission reduction bec ause the target is fixed. Conclusion: The results of this study have explored these issues by examining the effects of shocks that have actually occurred i n the past decade: A surprising surge of economic gro wth in developing countries and a global financial crisis.

A downstream system at the household level would lead to similar changes in emissions but would raise major administrative and privacy issues. Greater changes in behavior might result from a vehicle manufacturer\u2013based scheme, but there are complex administrative issues. Tailpipe standards appear to be achieving the same result. An offset system would provide financial incentives for a wider range of abatement measures, including those undertaken by local governments such as smart growth zoning, parking pricing, and transit improvements. Empirical experience with the Clean Development Mechanism, however, suggests that transportation offsets, particularly those reliant on travel behavior changes, face significant hurdles in proving \u201cadditionality\u201d and documenting emissions savings. This paper therefore proposes a \u201cmunicipal mobility manager\u201d trading design, under which local governments would assume responsibility for transportation emissions. This would give them the same financial incentives to implement abatement measures as under an offset scheme but would avoid the methodological and administrative challenges.

The adverse health aspects related to climate change may include heat-related disorders, such as heat stress and economic consequences of reduced work capacity; respiratory disorders, including those exacerbated by air pollution and aeroallergens, such as asthma; infectious diseases, including vectorborne diseases and waterborne diseases, such as childhood gastrointestinal diseases; food insecurity, including reduced crop yields and an increase in plant diseases; and mental health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, that are associated with natural disasters. Substantial health and economic cobenefits could be associated with reductions in fossil fuel combustion. For example, greenhouse gas emission policies may yield net economic benefit, with health benefits from air quality improvements potentially offsetting the cost of US and international carbon policies.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nEvidence over the past 20 years indicates that climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes.

The Finnish detached house building stock was divided into four age classes according to the building code in effect at the time of their construction. Multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm was used to minimize the life cycle cost and CO2 emissions in each building type for five different main heating systems (district heating, wood/oil boiler, direct electric heating, and ground-source heat pump) by improving the building envelope and systems. Cost-effective emission reductions were possible with all heating systems, but especially with ground-source heat pumps. Replacing oil boilers with ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs), emissions could be reduced by 79% to 92% across all the studied detached houses and investment levels. With all the other heating systems, emission reductions of 20% to 75% were possible.

From bauxite mine to aluminum ingot, the total global average emissions vary somewhat in the literature, but most reported values are now between 12 and 17 metric tonnes of CO 2 -equivalents per tonne of aluminum, depending on the various estimates and assumptions made. Two-thirds of these gases are emitted because the electricity used for electrolysis is produced from fossil fuel sources, mainly coal but also natural gas. Reduction of these emissions is now the main environmental challenge for the aluminum industry. Globally, the best result is obtained by maximizing aluminum production using green electrical energy from renewable sources. Aluminum production is categorized as an activity at very high risk of carbon leakage, which occurs when there is an increase in carbon dioxide emissions by new production in one country as a result of ceased production with emissions reduction in a second country with a strict climate policy.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "23a447b80c61c866b8a30898a1264aec608e2835", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2034533373", "DOI": "10.4271/2014-01-1209", "CorpusId": 33550721}, "title": "Fuel System Pressure Increase for Enhanced Performance of GDi Multi-Hole Injection Systems", "abstract": "The progressive trend towards the GDi engine downsizing, the focus on better fuel efficiency and performance, and the regulatory requirements with respect to the combustion emissions have brought the focus of attention on strategies for improvement of in-cylinder mixture preparation and identification and elimination of the sources of combustion emissions, in particular the in-cylinder particulate formation.

Methods We designed interventions for laparoscopic hysterectomy from approaches that sustainable health care organizations advocate. We used a hybrid environmental life cycle assessment framework to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from the proposed interventions. We conducted the study from September 2015 to December 2016 at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Results The largest carbon footprint savings came from selecting specific anesthetic gases and minimizing the materials used in surgery. Energy-related interventions resulted in a 10% reduction in carbon footprint per case but would result in larger savings for the whole facility. Commonly implemented approaches, such as recycling surgical waste, resulted in less than a 5% reduction in greenhouse gases. Conclusions To reduce the environmental emissions of surgeries, health care providers need to implement a combination of approaches, including minimizing materials, moving away from certain heat-trapping anesthetic gases, maximizing instrument reuse or single-use device reprocessing, and reducing off-hour energy use in the operating room. These strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of an average laparoscopic hysterectomy by up to 80%. Recycling alone does very little to reduce environmental footprint.

We show that many species communities and ocean habitats will change from their current states. Ocean acidification and warming increase the potential for an overall simplification of ecosystem structure and function with reduced energy flow among trophic levels and little scope for species to acclimate. The future simplification of our oceans has profound consequences for our current way of life, particularly for coastal populations and those that rely on oceans for food and trade. Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anticipated to drive change to ocean ecosystems, but a conceptualization of biological change derived from quantitative analyses is lacking. Derived from multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632 published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this response does not translate into greater secondary production, which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth\u2019s heat budget. Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for microbes. This conceptualization of change across whole communities and their trophic linkages forecast a reduction in diversity and abundances of various key species that underpin current functioning of marine ecosystems.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0b6e57419b9c73439002de48892ab38e276b8f7a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1996227762", "DOI": "10.1080/03088839.2012.671543", "CorpusId": 153493328}, "title": "Environmental awareness and practice concerning maritime air emissions: the case of the Greek shipping industry", "abstract": "One of the most urgent environmental problems facing the shipping industry today is the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from its operations and the possible cost-effective ways in which this reduction could be accomplished.

We demonstrate that the characterisation factors as calculated to date are unstable due to being derived from the non-smooth and highly varying part of the underlying emission-impact functions. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the currently available characterisation factors and to propose a modification that makes use of the full range of the underlying functions. Method The characterisation factors derived in this paper are based on updates of data used to support European air pollution agreements under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) and the European Commission. The focus in this paper is on the analysis of characterisation factors for acidification. The analysis of characterisation factors for terrestrial eutrophication from nitrogen compounds is a simple extension of the methods described here. The analysis is conducted for 25 European nations, i.e. for 23 EU countries plus Norway and Switzerland; Cyprus and Malta are excluded due to lack of data on critical loads. Results and Conclusions We show that a linear model which is calibrated to emission changes of \u009650% is generally more reliable than characterisation factors which are based on emission changes of plus or minus 10%. Application of these characterisation factors are justified for emission reductions up to 30% in total European emissions, compared to 2000.

Ultimately, total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the product of population, economic activity per capita, energy use per unit of economic activity, and the carbon intensity of energy used. Although greenhouse gas emissions can be limited by reducing economic activity, this option obviously has little appeal even to rich countries, let alone poor ones. Much attention has therefore been placed on the role that technological improvements can play in reducing carbon emissions and in lowering the cost of those reductions. In addition, the influence of technological changes on the emission, concentration, and cost of reducing GHGs will tend to overwhelm other factors, especially in the longer term. Understanding the process of technological change is therefore of utmost importance. Nonetheless, the task of measuring, modeling, and ultimately influencing the path of technological development is fraught with complexity and uncertainty?as are the technologies themselves. Although there is little debate over the importance of energy efficiency in limiting GHG emissions, there is intense debate about its cost-effectiveness and about the government policies that should be pursued to enhance energy efficiency. At the risk of excessive simplification, we can characterize \"technologists\" as believing that there are plentiful opportunities for low-cost, or even \"negative-cost\" improvements in energy efficiency, and that realizing these opportunities will require active intervention in markets for energy-using equipment to help overcome barriers to the use of more efficient technologies. Most economists, on the other hand, acknowledge that there are \"market barriers\" to the penetration of various technologies that enhance energy efficiency, but that only some of these barriers represent real \"market failures\" that reduce economic efficiency. In this essay, we examine what lies behind this dichotomy in perspectives. Ultimately, the veracity of different perspectives is an empirical question and reliable empirical evidence on the issues identified above is surprisingly limited. We review the evidence that is available, finding that although energy and technology markets certainly are not perfect (no markets are), the balance of evidence supports the view that there is not as much \"free lunch\" in energy efficiency as some would suggest. On the other hand, a case can be made for the existence of certain inefficiencies in energy technology markets, thus raising the possibility of some inexpensive GHG control through energy-efficiency enhancement.

We aimed to investigate the effects of 6\u00a0years of fertilizer application on N2O emission pathways and the N2O emission ratio from heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrification in tea plantation.MethodsWe performed a 15N-tracing experiment under 40 and 60\u00a0% water-holding capacity (WHC) to investigate the effects of 6\u00a0years of fertilizer application on N2O-emission pathways and emission ratios from heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrification in soil from tea plantations.ResultsSix years of fertilizer application stimulated both heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrification, particularly under conditions of higher soil moisture. Autotrophic nitrification was the predominant pathway for N2O emission in tea soils, being responsible for 66.7\u201375.9\u00a0% and 50.4\u201356.9\u00a0% of N2O emission in unfertilized and fertilized soils, respectively.

More specifically, this paper intends to analyze environmental efficiency of ports in Korea and to estimate the potential CO2 emission reduction by ports in the country. The main methodology is a Slacks-Based Measure Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) model. Data, on labor, capital, and energy used as major inputs of the port sector; on cargo tonnage and vessel tonnage handled as desirable outputs; and on CO2 emissions as an undesirable output, were collected and estimated. The SBM-DEA model was able to provide us with a more comprehensive efficiency of combining economic performance and environmental performance and was also able to capture slack values of input excess and undesirable output excess (CO2) as well as desirable output shortage. Using the model and the data, it was found that Korean ports are deemed to be economically inefficient, but environmentally efficient when considering economic and environmental performances simultaneously.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "b498eefb005dc8bcb3ef50b7e494222fcb72732e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2411741920", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb00093.x", "CorpusId": 2084947, "PubMed": "10514872"}, "title": "Positron Emission Tomography Receptor Studies", "abstract": "Several PET receptor ligands have been used to investigate the neurochemical basis of the epilepsies. 11C-Flumazenil binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR)-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor complex; 11C-diprenorphine, 18F-cyclofoxy, and 11C-carfentanil to opiate receptors; and 11C-Deprenyl to monoamine oxidase B. These studies should be considered alongside high-quality magnetic resonance imaging that demonstrates the structural basis of the condition. The results should be correlated with those of quantitative in vitro neuropathologic and autoradiographic studies. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy has been studied with 11C-flumazenil and 11C-diprenorphine. There is no evidence of any interictal overall abnormality of opioid receptors in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, but typical absences have been found to displace 11C-diprenorphine from the association areas of the neocortex. This finding implies that release of endogenous opioids has a role in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of typical absences in humans. In contrast, binding of 11C-flumazenil to cBZRs has been shown not to be affected by serial absences. Studies of interictal 11C-flumazenil binding in idiopathic generalized epilepsy have not given uniform results. In one investigation a slight reduction was reported in the neocortex of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in comparison with patients with partial seizures. Also observed was increased benzodiazepine receptor density in the cerebellar nuclei and decreased density in the thalamus. Widespread increases in cBZRs also have been reported in cerebral neocortex, thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. In unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, reduction of binding of 11C-flumazenil has been shown to be confined to the hippocampus and to be over and above that caused by neuron loss and hippocampal atrophy. In malformations of cortical development, abnormalities of cBZRs, as demonstrated with 11C-flumazenil PET, are more extensive than the structural abnormality revealed with magnetic resonance imaging. There often are areas of increased cBZRs, a pattern that appears unique to malformations of cortical development and that may reflect both functional and structural anomalies. In patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, upregulation of mu opioid receptors has been found in lateral neocortex without an overall increase of opioid receptor binding. The pathophysiologic explanation for this finding is not clear. Possibilities include up-regulation of mu receptors in response to epileptic activity and down-regulation or occupation of kappa opioid receptors. Important future developments in this field that will increase understanding of the processes that underlie the epilepsies will come from the development of further ligands, particularly tracers that are specific for excitatory amino acid receptors, the subtypes of the opioid receptors, and the GABAB receptor.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "6a3ed32d6a7b078fd700042b789197f501e76463", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1521705238", "DOI": "10.1002/er.1871", "CorpusId": 94491899}, "title": "A methodology for territorial distribution of CO2 emission reductions in transport sector", "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emission reduction is the pillar of the Kyoto Protocol and one of the main goals of the European Union (UE) energy policy.

This paper transfers global greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in both these documents to the transport sector and specifically to CO2 emissions. It proposes a nonlinear distribution method with objective, dynamic targets for reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector, according to the context and characteristics of each geographical area. First, we analyse CO2 emissions from transport in the reference year (1990) and their evolution from 1990 to 2007. We then propose a nonlinear methodology for distributing dynamic CO2 emission reduction targets. We have applied the proposed distribution function for 2012 and 2020 at two territorial levels (EU member states and Spanish autonomous regions). The weighted distribution is based on per capita CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per gross domestic product. Finally, we show the weighted targets found for each EU member state and each Spanish autonomous region, compare them with the real achievements to date, and forecast the situation for the years the Kyoto and EU goals are to be met. The results underline the need for \u2018weighted\u2019 decentralised decisions to be made at different territorial levels with a view to achieving a common goal, so relative convergence of all the geographical areas is reached over time.

Subtraction analyses of the binding potential maps were then performed within subjects, between conditions, on a voxel-by-voxel basis.\n\n\nSETTING\nImaging center at a university medical center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFourteen healthy female volunteers. Intervention Sustained neutral and sadness states, randomized and counterbalanced in order, elicited by the cued recall of an autobiographical event associated with that emotion.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nChanges in mu-opioid receptor availability and negative and positive affect ratings between conditions. Increases or reductions in the in vivo receptor measure reflect deactivation or activation of neurotransmitter release, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe sustained sadness condition was associated with a statistically significant deactivation in mu-opioid neurotransmission in the rostral anterior cingulate, ventral pallidum, amygdala, and inferior temporal cortex. This deactivation was reflected by increases in mu-opioid receptor availability in vivo. The deactivation of mu-opioid neurotransmission in the rostral anterior cingulate, ventral pallidum, and amygdala was correlated with the increases in negative affect ratings and the reductions in positive affect ratings during the sustained sadness state.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data demonstrate dynamic changes in mu-opioid neurotransmission in response to an experimentally induced negative affective state.

Seven different emission scenarios were modeled to assess the relationship between the emission of precursors and ambient aerosol concentration, including a baseline emission inventory, and six sensitivity scenarios with emission reductions in relation to the baseline inventory: a 50% reduction in SO2 emissions; no SO2 emissions; a 50% reduction in SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions; no sulfate (PSO4) particle emissions; no PSO4 and nitrate (PNO3) particle emissions; and no PNO3 emissions. Results show that ambient PM2.5 behavior is not linearly dependent on the emission of precursors. Variation levels in PM2.5 concentrations did not correspond to the reduction ratios applied to precursor emissions, mainly due to the contribution of organic and elemental carbon, and other secondary organic aerosol species.

We find that post-Kyoto agreements are likely to cover only small reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions with abatement duties predominantly assigned to the industrialized countries while developing countries do not make any commitments, but can sell emission abatement to the industrialized world.

The X-ray crystal structure of all complexes, including 3a (R = H) and 3b (R = Me), showed that while the carboranyl C-C bond distance increases with the increasing steric effect of the 2-R substituent (3a-3d), the bond distance is more likely to be influenced by the electronic effect of the substituent for the 2-aryl substituted complexes (3e-3g).

Objectives: This study had three aims: a) Compare the range in projected impacts that arises from using different adaptation modeling methods; b) compare the range in impacts that arises from adaptation uncertainty with ranges from using multiple climate models and emissions scenarios; c) recommend modeling method(s) to use in future impact assessments. Methods: We estimated impacts for 2070\u20132099 for 14 European cities, applying six different methods for modeling adaptation; we also estimated impacts with five climate models run under two emissions scenarios to explore the relative effects of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. Results: The range of the difference (percent) in impacts between including and excluding adaptation, irrespective of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty, can be as low as 28% with one method and up to 103% with another (mean across 14 cities). In 13 of 14 cities, the ranges in projected impacts due to adaptation uncertainty are larger than those associated with climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. Conclusions: Researchers should carefully consider how to model adaptation because it is a source of uncertainty that can be greater than the uncertainty in emissions and climate modeling.

Using interviews and observation in combination with life cycle assessment, we compare GHG emissions resulting from the baseline case (1,200 tonnes per day [t/d] recycled through informal channels; 5,700 t/d landfilled) to three alternative scenarios that formalize the recycling sector: the prohibition of informal recycling; a reduction in informal recycling coupled with a scale\u2010up of formalized recycling; and the replacement of informal recycling with formal recycling. We find that the baseline recycling scenario, dependent on the informal sector only, emits far fewer GHGs than do all formalization scenarios.

We compared two organic farming systems \u2013 biodynamic (BIODYN) and bioorganic (BIOORG) \u2013 with two non-organic systems \u2013 solely mineral fertilisation (CONMIN) and mixed farming including farmyard manure (CONFYM) \u2013 all reflecting Swiss farming practices\u2013together with an unfertilised control (NOFERT). We observed a 40.2% reduction of N2O emissions per hectare for organic compared to non-organic systems. In contrast to current knowledge, yield-scaled cumulated N2O emissions under silage maize were similar between organic and non-organic systems. Cumulated on area scale we recorded under silage maize a modest CH4 uptake for BIODYN and CONMIN and high CH4 emissions for CONFYM. We found that, in addition to N input, quality properties such as pH, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass significantly affected N2O emissions. This study showed that organic farming systems can be a viable measure contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation in the agricultural sector.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e89667ad7f1d1b07207556b53d321c9d12bf6037", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2254277128", "DOI": "10.29310/WP.2015.06", "CorpusId": 155846655}, "title": "Are we turning a brighter shade of green? The relationship between household characteristics and greenhouse gas emissions from consumption in New Zealand", "abstract": "We test whether New Zealand households have become greener consumers by estimating environmental Engel curves (EECs), which describe the relationship between household income and the pollution embodied in a household\u2019s consumption bundle. Our pollutants of interest are greenhouse gases (GHGs). To our knowledge, this is the first paper that tests for a change over time in climate change-related household behaviour. We calculate the greenhouse gases embodied in household consumption bundles using standard environmental input-output (IO) analysis combined with detailed household expenditure data from the 2006/07 and 2012/13 waves of the New Zealand Household Economic Survey. Consistent with international literature, we find that emissions increase less-than-proportionately with household expenditure (a proxy for permanent income). There is significant variation in expenditure elasticities across consumption categories; emissions from household energy are unresponsive to household expenditure, while emissions from transport are highly responsive to expenditure. Household expenditure and composition explain the majority of the cross-sectional variation in household emissions. We conduct a simple test for changes over time in household consumption patterns that affect emissions, taking price changes into account. We find that, controlling for a rich set of household characteristics, household emissions were marginally lower on average in the 2012/13 survey than the 2006/07 survey. This result is largely driven by a reduction in emissions from household energy. We also find that wealthier households had a smaller reduction in emissions between surveys. Our results suggest this is due to higher levels of international air travel by wealthier households.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "ce661d7d2371840343cd2e88fd66c032e0791edd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2098409095", "DOI": "10.1890/04-1322", "CorpusId": 28202486}, "title": "NITROGEN CYCLING IN TROPICAL PLANTATION FORESTS: POTENTIAL CONTROLS ON NITROGEN RETENTION", "abstract": "The establishment and management of tropical plantations has the potential to significantly alter patterns in nitrogen (N) cycling relative to old-growth tropical forests, which are generally characterized by high N availability and large fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas. We used 15 N tracer additions to examine the effects of plantation establishment and management on gross N-cycling rates, N retention via microbial assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate (NO 3 2 ) reduction to ammonium (NH4 1 ) (DNRA), and N losses via N2O emissions. In general, plantations had lower rates of N cycling and increased potential for N losses compared to old-growth forests, but there were few differences between very short (one-year) rotation and 10-yr-old uncut plantations. Gross N mineralization declined by almost 50% in the plantations compared to the old- growth forests, and much of the mineralized N was nitrified at all sites. Gross nitrification rates were more variable and did not differ between old-growth forests and unfertilized plantations; however, fertilization increased gross nitrification by a factor of 6 in short- rotation forests, signaling a potential mechanism for increased N losses via leaching and gaseous emissions. Old-growth forests had significantly higher microbial biomass N and NH4 1 assimilation rates. No microbial N assimilation was measured in the plantation soils, nor was there evidence of gross NH4 1 immobilization from estimates of NH4 1 consumption and nitrification. Plantations and old-growth forests had similar DNRA rates (0.23 mg\u00b7g 21 \u00b7d 21 ), which retains N in the ecosystem, and plantations had lower N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes from plantations were highly sensitive to reducing conditions, high- lighting the potential for high rates of N 2O losses. Our results show that plantation estab- lishment can decrease rates of N cycling, but once forests are converted to plantations, internal N-cycling pathways and N2O fluxes are relatively resistant to disturbance associated with short rotation length.", "year": 2005}]}
