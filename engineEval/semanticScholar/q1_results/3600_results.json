Data were collected during six measuring periods in two years (1995, 1996). The evaluation of more than 5700 measuring series demonstrated very strong seasonal and interannual variations of methane emission, with extremely high rates in the range between 24 and 104\u00a0mg CH 4 m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 in June/July 1995, and the lowest values in the range between 0\u00b703 and 0\u00b711\u00a0mg\u00a0CH 4 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 in October 1996. The highest single emission rate was 243\u00a0mg\u00a0CH 4 \u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 . Therefore this shore region represents, at least periodically, a hot spot for methane emission from a brackish water ecosystem into the atmosphere. The crucial controlling factor for the interannual and seasonal variations of methane emission and also for the small spatial differences was found to be the amount of organic matter in the sediment. This exerted a direct influence on methanogenesis and additionally indirect effects on oxygen dynamics and the relationships between methanogenesis and sulphate reduction. The significant correlation between methane emission and temperature in the water and sediment demonstrated that diurnal and long-term variations of emission rates during each season were mainly regulated by temperature. Only at low emission rates did other, indirect ecological factors become more important in controlling methane emission.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "f27d7d294daf66b90dd07ceabd33092d61516f08", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2054996805", "DOI": "10.1111/gcbb.12179", "CorpusId": 85243775}, "title": "Sustainability of forest bioenergy in Europe: land\u2010use\u2010related carbon dioxide emissions of forest harvest residues", "abstract": "Increasing bioenergy production from forest harvest residues decreases litter input to the soil and can thus reduce the carbon stock and sink of forests. This effect may negate greenhouse gas savings obtained by using bioenergy. We used a spatially explicit modelling framework to assess the reduction in the forest litter and soil carbon stocks across Europe, assuming that a sustainable potential of bioenergy from forest harvest residues is taken into use. The forest harvest residue removal reduced the carbon stocks of litter and soil on average by 3% over the period from 2016 to 2100. The reduction was small compared to the size of the carbon stocks but significant in comparison to the amount of energy produced from the residues. As a result of these land\u2010use\u2010related emissions, bioenergy production from forest harvest residues would need to be continued for 60\u201380 years to achieve a 60% carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in heat and power generation compared to the fossil fuels it replaces in most European countries. The emission reductions achieved and their timings varied among countries because of differences in the litter and soil carbon loss.

Coal and coke are currently the primary fuels for the sector, supplanting the dominance of natural gas in the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1997, primary physical energy intensity for cement production (SIC 324) dropped 30%,from 7.9 GJ/t to 5.6 GJ/t, while carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption (carbon dioxide emissions expressed in tons of carbon per ton cement) dropped 25%, from 0.16 tC/ton to 0.12 tC/ton. Carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption and clinker calcination dropped 17%, from 0.29 tC/ton to 0.24 tC/ton. They examined 30 energy efficient technologies and measures and estimated energy savings, carbon dioxide savings, investment costs, and operation and maintenance costs for each of the measures. They constructed an energy conservation supply curve for U.S. cement industry which found a total cost-effective reduction of 0.6 GJ/ton of cement consisting of measures having a simple payback period of 3 years or less. This is equivalent to potential energy savings of 11% of 1994 energy use for cement making and a savings of 5% of total 1994 carbon dioxide emissions by the U.S. cement industry. Assuming the increased production of blended cement in the U.S., as is common in many parts of the world, the technical potential for energy efficiency improvement would not change considerably.

The increase in the methane burden began in 2007, with the mean global mole fraction in remote surface background air rising from about 1,775 ppb in 2006 to 1,850 ppb in 2017. Simultaneously the 13C/12C isotopic ratio (expressed as \u03b413CCH4) has shifted, now trending negative for more than a decade. The causes of methane's recent mole fraction increase are therefore either a change in the relative proportions (and totals) of emissions from biogenic and thermogenic and pyrogenic sources, especially in the tropics and subtropics, or a decline in the atmospheric sink of methane, or both. Unfortunately, with limited measurement data sets, it is not currently possible to be more definitive. The climate warming impact of the observed methane increase over the past decade, if continued at >5 ppb/year in the coming decades, is sufficient to challenge the Paris Agreement, which requires sharp cuts in the atmospheric methane burden.

In this study, we measured the volatilization losses after banding of urea at depths of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 cm in a slightly acidic (pH 6) silt loam soil using wind tunnels. Mineral nitrogen (N) concentration and pH were measured in the top 2 cm of soil to determine the extent of urea N migration and the influence of placement depth on the availability of ammoniacal N for volatilization near the soil surface. Ammonia volatilization losses were 50% of applied N when urea was banded at the surface, and incorporation of the band decreased emissions by an average of 7% cm (14% cm when expressed as a percentage of losses after surface banding). Incorporating urea at depths >7.5 cm therefore resulted in negligible NH emissions and maximum N retention. Cumulative losses increased exponentially with increasing maximum NH-N and pH values measured in the surface soil during the experiment. However, temporal variations in these soil properties were poorly related to the temporal variations in NH emission rates, likely as a result of interactions with other factors (e.g., water content and NH-N adsorption) on, and fixation by, soil particles. Laboratory and field volatilization data from the literature were summarized and used to determine a relationship between NH losses and depth of urea incorporation. When emissions were expressed as a percentage of losses for a surface application, the mean reduction after urea incorporation was approximately 12.5% cm.

One option for reducing net emissions is to lessen damage to residual forests during selective logging, thereby retaining additional carbon in biomass. A pilot carbon offset project was initiated in Sabah, Malaysia, in 1992 in which a power company provided funds to a timber concessionaire to implement guidelines aimed at reducing logging damage; in doing so, the utility gained potential credit towards future emissions reduction requirements. To quantify the carbon retained due to this effort, we compared dipterocarp forests logged according to reduced-impact logging guidelines with forests logged by conventional methods in terms of the above- and below-ground biomass both before and after logging. Prior to logging, the forest stored approximately 400 Mg biomass ha-1, 17 percent of which was belowground.

Forty-one percent of the unharvested trees <60 cm DBH were severely damaged (uprooted and crushed) from logging in conventional logging areas in contrast to 15 percent in reduced-impact logging areas. Approximately 18 and 12 percent, respectively, of the remaining residual trees in conventional and reduced-impact logging areas suffered less severe damage (e.g., crown or bark damage). Mortality rates of the less severely damaged trees in all DBH classes were higher during the first year in conventional logging areas than in reduced-impact logging areas. One yr post harvest, conventional and reduced-impact logging areas contained biomass equivalent to about 44 percent and 67 percent of pre-logging levels, respectively. Approximately 62 percent of the difference in carbon retention was due to fewer trees killed in the reduced-impact logging areas; the remaining 38 percent was due to a lower mass of branches, stumps and waste wood from felled trees in reduced-impact logging areas. Mortality of damaged trees in both areas may contribute to net decreases in biomass for several years after logging.

The 2013 mean combustion-derived OC concentrations were 0.5 to 1.4\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 at the five sites operating in that year. Mean annual combustion-derived OC concentrations declined from 3.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 (68\u202f% of total OC) to 1.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 (60\u202f% of total OC) between 1999 and 2013 at the urban Atlanta, Georgia, site (JST) and from 2.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 (39\u202f% of total OC) to 0.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 (30\u202f% of total OC) between 2001 and 2013 at the urban Birmingham, Alabama (BHM), site. The urban OC declines coincide with reductions of motor vehicle emissions between 2006 and 2010, which may have decreased mean OC concentrations at the urban SEARCH sites by >\u202f2\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123.

Analyses using non-soil potassium as a biomass burning tracer indicate that biomass burning OC occurs throughout the year at all sites. All eight SEARCH sites show an association of OC with sulfate (SO4) ranging from 0.3 to 1.0\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 on average, representing \u2009\u223c\u2009\u202f25\u202f% of the 1999 to 2013 mean OC concentrations.

At Class I areas downwind of major urban areas (e.g., California), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), predominantly because of mobile sources, is the dominant contributor to haze. For many western Class I areas, POM from wildland fires and fine particles from windblown dust, largely uncontrollable sources, are significant contributors to haze. International emissions are an additional uncontrollable and significant contribution to total sulfate (SO4) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations at the western Class I areas. In the Southeast, SO2 emissions reductions are projected to result in nearly 1:1 regional SO4 reductions; oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions reductions have minimal impact on NO3 concentrations and haze. In the West, SO2 emissions reductions result in incremental SO4 reductions, whereas mobile NOx emissions reductions are projected to reduce NO3 and improve visibility at Class I areas affected by urban areas. Because wildfire, dust, and international emissions have large contributions to the haziest days and are mostly uncontrollable in the West, reductions from anthropogenic sources in the West have less effect in improving visibility compared with the Southeast.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "3366d9e6a5b9c036e517d882b79e751b7e2bf3ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998672869", "DOI": "10.3141/2139-20", "CorpusId": 108816741}, "title": "Achieving Carbon-Efficient Transportation", "abstract": "Transportation is a major user of carbon-based fuels and is increasingly being highlighted as the sector that contributes the least to carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction targets.

A backcasting study approach was used, and the likely impacts of alternative images of 2025 were tested. A transportation and carbon simulation game was also developed for London. Within this game, users are able to consider a series of potential policy packages, such as low-emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimens, public transportation, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long-distance travel substitution, freight transportation, and international air, and select various levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emissions reduction targets. The roles of two external enabling measures, carbon rationing and oil pricing, were also considered. The paper considers an optimized policy package for 2025. A deep reduction in CO2 emissions from the transportation sector is theoretically possible, yet difficult to achieve.

The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO2 equivalent. Units of CO2 equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks.MethodsCO2 equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG\u2019s global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO2 over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO2, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO2 equivalent today.Results and discussionA GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building\u2019s life cycle emissions showed a 30\u00a0% reduction in CO2 equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs.

Future changes in climate and emissions projected by the IPCC A1B scenario are imposed separately and together through sensitivity simulations. Accounting for sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) aerosols, concentrations of individual aerosol species change by \u22121.5 to +0.8 \u03bcg m\u22123, and PM2.5 levels are projected to change by about 10\u201320% in eastern China as a result of 2000\u20132050 change in climate alone. With future changes in anthropogenic emissions alone, concentrations of sulfate, BC, and OC are simulated to decrease because of assumed reductions in emissions, and those of nitrate are predicted to increase because of higher NOx emissions combined with decreases in sulfate. The net result is a predicted reduction of seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China by 1\u20138 \u03bcg m\u22123 (or 10\u201340%) over 2000\u20132050.

Under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Joint Implementation instrument and the Clean Development Mechanism now provide an opening for substantial international resource transfers and potential for supporting sustainable development through the transfer of cleaner technologies or sustainable forestry and agro\u2013forestry practices.

This paper argues that \u2013 given the combination of political, economic and scientific realities as they are \u2013 Kyoto is a good foundation, a good first stepping stone on the most practical path if we are to address Climate Change seriously. A constructive approach asks what are the requirements for the design of a second step in the process, a successor to the Kyoto regime of 2008-2012, one that would build on what is good about it and fix what is most lacking. This paper offers a proposal that seeks realistically to bring in all countries and to look far into the future. It argues that the path of emission targets for the 21st century must be selected sequentially, perhaps one decade at a time, all within a common framework. An analogy for the framework would be the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which gave us 50 years of successful rounds negotiating trade liberalization, even though the original signers did know what specifics would emerge. The paper proposes allocating relative targets across countries by means of a formula that is fairly general at first but that becomes increasingly specific as the decade in question approaches. New joiners would be obligated to adopt emissions targets, but these paths need not immediately fall below their \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d growth path. Allowing new joiners to sell permits in the initial budget period would then provide them with an economic incentive to join, or at least would not penalize them. It would carry economic benefits for both rich and poor countries, while also bringing environmental benefits to all. Countries would be required in subsequent budget periods of their participation to adopt steeper reductions in their emissions targets relative to their \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d paths. The extent of relative cuts across countries would depend on such factors in the formulas as the per capita income and past emission levels of the country in question. The extent of cuts in aggregate global emissions would depend \u2013 as is inevitable -- on how strong is the international political consensus for aggressive action at that point in history.

The elicitor of the pine's response is located in the sawfly's oviduct secretion enveloping the eggs after deposition. Application of this secretion on twigs with artificially conducted ovipositional woundings mimics the effects of egg deposition. Furthermore, jasmonic acid (JA) induces a volatile pattern similar, but not identical, to the one induced by egg deposition. To gain deeper insight into the transduction of plant signals induced by herbivore egg deposition, it was investigated whether ethylene emission from pine is affected by sawfly egg deposition. Systemically induced ethylene emission from differently treated pine twigs was monitored for a period of 3 d after treatment. Ethylene emissions from untreated control twigs were compared with those from twigs treated as follows: (i) sawfly egg secretion [=oviduct secretion (OVI)] was transferred on artificially wounded pine needles (attractive volatiles), (ii) needles were artificially wounded (non-attractive volatiles), and (iii) the twig was supplied with JA (attractive volatiles). Ethylene emission from systemically OVI-induced twigs was significantly lower than from untreated controls, whereas artificial wounding had no detectable effect.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil moisture during the non-rice growing season on CH 4 emission, production, and oxidation within the subsequent rice-growing season. Five moisture levels ranging from air-dryness to flooding were established in pots during the non-rice growing season. The CH 4 fluxes from rice soils in the pots were monitored in a dosed chamber and dark incubation was performed to determine CH 4 production and oxidation potentials. Both CH 4 emission and production increased significantly as the soil got wetter except when it was air-dated. The CH 4 oxidation potential was also stimulated by the previous higher soil water content, which therefore buffered emission of the gas as its production increased. Soil water content considerably affected the seasonal variation pattern of CH 4 flux and soil redox potential (E H ). The higher the soil water content, the quicker soil E H declined and the earlier CH 4 emission initiated after rice transplantation. Previous soil water content significantly affected soil organic C content before rice transplantation. Within the rice-growing season both the mean CH4 flux and its production rate were significantly correlated with soil organic C content. Thus water-history-induced change of soil organic C content may have affected soil reduction rate, and then CH 4 production and emission within the rice-growing season.

In response, world governments have agreed to limit global temperature change to 2\u00b0C, which requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In advanced economies, a commitment to a 2\u00b0C limit generally represents a reduction of emissions of between 80-95% from the 1990 baseline. Despite this, emissions from international aviation increased by 53 % between 1990 and 2011 in those countries. Academic researchers are among the highest emitters, primarily as a result of emissions from flying to conferences, project meetings, and fieldwork.

While stimulating ideas and creating personal links of trust are important benefits of face-to-face meetings, these benefits may be outweighed by the opportunities to reach much wider communities by developing and using new social media and online platforms. We argue that the research community needs a roadmap to reduce its emissions following government targets, which ironically are based on findings of the research community. A roadmap to a low-carbon research space would need simple monitoring, an example of which is presented here and documents the Tyndall Travel Tracker, incentives from international and national research platforms and funders, and a fundamental change in the research culture to align the walk with the talk.

Isoprene and monoterpenes accounted for \ufffd 75% of the total OH reactivity in this region and are important volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for modeling atmospheric chemistry in Amazonia. The presence of fair weather clouds (cumulus humilis) had an important impact on the vertical distribution and chemistry of VOCs through the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the cloud layer, and the free troposphere (FT). Entrainment velocities between 10:00 and 11:30 local time (LT) are calculated to be on the order of 8\u201310 cm/s. The ratio of methyl-vinyl-ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MAC) (unique oxidation products of isoprene chemistry) with respect to isoprene showed a pronounced increase in the cloud layer due to entrainment and an increased oxidative capacity in broken cloud decks. A decrease of the ratio in the lower free troposphere suggests cloud venting through activated clouds. OH modeled in the planetary boundary layer using a photochemical box model is much lower than OH calculated from a mixed layer budget approach. An ambient reactive sesquiterpene mixing ratio of 1% of isoprene would be sufficient to explain most of this discrepancy. Increased OH production due to increased photolysis in the cloud layer balances the low OH values modeled for the planetary boundary layer.

Increased production of oil and natural gas, particularly from shale resources using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, made the United States the world\u2019s largest producer of oil and natural gas in 2014. This review examines air quality impacts, specifically, changes in greenhouse gas, criteria air pollutant, and air toxics emissions from oil and gas production activities that are a result of these changes in energy supplies and use. National emission inventories indicate that volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from oil and gas supply chains in the United States have been increasing significantly, whereas emission inventories for greenhouse gases have seen slight declines over the past decade. These emission inventories are based on counts of equipment and operational activities (activity factors), multiplied by average emission factors, and therefore are subject to uncertainties in these factors. Although uncertainties associated with activity data and missing emission source types can be significant, multiple recent measurement studies indicate that the greatest uncertainties are associated with emission factors. In many source categories, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. When super-emitters are accounted for, multiple measurement approaches, at multiple scales, produce similar results for estimated emissions. Challenges moving forward include identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes. Work done to date suggests that both equipment malfunction and operational practices can be important. Finally, although most of this review focuses on emissions from energy supply infrastructures, the regional air quality implications of some coupled energy production and use scenarios are examined. These case studies suggest that both energy production and use should be considered in assessing air quality implications of changes in energy infrastructures, and that impacts are likely to vary among regions. Implications: The energy supply infrastructure in the United States has been changing dramatically over the past decade, leading to changes in emissions from oil and natural gas supply chain sources. In many source categories along these supply chains, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions.

We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions.

Here we demonstrate a modulation of the optoelectronic properties of 2D TMDCs, including MoS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, by interfacing them with two metal-centered phthalocyanine (MPc) molecules: nickel Pc (NiPc) and magnesium Pc (MgPc). We show that the photoluminescence (PL) emission can be selectively and reversibly engineered through energetically favorable electron transfer from photoexcited TMDCs to MPcs. NiPc molecules, whose reduction potential is positioned below the conduction band minima (CBM) of monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2, but is higher than that of MoS2, quench the PL signatures of MoSe2 and WSe2, but not MoS2. Similarly, MgPc quenches only WSe2, as its reduction potential is situated below the CBM of WSe2, but above those of MoS2 and MoSe2. The quenched PL emission can be fully recovered when MPc molecules are removed from the TMDC surfaces, which may be refunctionalized and recycled multiple times. We also find that photocurrents from TMDCs, probed by photoconductive atomic force microscopy, increase over 2-fold only when the PL is quenched by MPcs, further supporting the photoinduced charge transfer mechanism.

It is a sector- and technology-oriented approach, and we calculated quantitative emission limitation objectives and global emissions starting from bottomup information on long-term reduction opportunities. Central to the calculations were long-term sustainability targets for the year 2050, formulated for (1) energy efficiency in the energy-intensive industry, (2) greenhouse gas intensity of electricity production, and (3) per capita emissions in the domestic sectors. Calculated emission limitation objectives for 13 world regions ranged from about \u221230% to more than +200%. The ranking of world regions in the differentiation turned out to be independent of the levels chosen for the long-term sustainability targets. The objectives seem sufficient to maintain the long-term possibility of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at about 550 ppm CO2-eq, but will require severe emission reductions. These may be relaxed to a certain degree if stabilization at 650 ppm CO2-eq is aimed for. We conclude that the bottom-up character of the approach made it possible to examine important basic principles of the Climate Convention, including equity, the needs and circumstances of developing countries, cost-effectiveness and sustainable development.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "eb942ea3414262ea9a5b7672273de09f2278234b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "642987635", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-015-9484-4", "CorpusId": 152323069}, "title": "Efficiency and equity of climate change policy", "abstract": "1.

In addition, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has become commercially available.

Relatively new developments in ICP-AES include: suspension nebulization analysis of clays (Laird et aI., 1991); interfacing ICP spectrometers with flow injection analyzers for automatic dilution, calibration, separation, concentration, standard additions and many other operations (Greenfield, 1983; LaFemiere et aI., 1985); interfacing ICP-AES with liquid chromatographs for concentration and speciation of elements (Roychowdhury & Koropchack, 1990); high salt neulizers to prevent clogging of nebulizers (Legere & Burgener, 1985); successful use of concentration and elimination or reduction of spectral interference techniques such as chelation/solvent extraction (Huang & Wai, 1986;", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "609c87100445a5d3be94002f3395a1327b665e60", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2006063080", "DOI": "10.1021/CG049973R", "CorpusId": 95551006}, "title": "Catalytic synthesis and structural characteristics of high-quality tetrapod-like ZnO nanocrystals by a modified vapor transport process", "abstract": "High-quality tetrapod-like ZnO (T-ZnO) nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified vapor transport process. NiO nanocrystals were prepared on a Si substrate as a catalyst. High-yield zinc vapor was produced by a carbothermal reduction of zinc carbonate to promote the synthesis of T-ZnO nanocrystals. The as-grown T-ZnO nanocrystals are assembled by four hexagonal prismatic nanorods, whose diameters and lengths are 80\u2212100 and 600\u22121000 nm, respectively. In the center of a T-ZnO nanocrystal, a tetrahedral core and several irregular patches were found among the nanorods. As a whole, T-ZnO nanocrystals are preferentially arranged along the \u3008001\u3009 direction of ZnO. The photoluminescence spectrum of T-ZnO nanocrystals showed two emission bands, a strong ultraviolet emission at around 390 nm and a weak blue emission at 440 nm.

The study assumes early actions and quantifies the market penetration of low carbon technologies, the emission pathways and the economic costs for an efficient reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such that the temperature limit is not exceeded. We evaluate the potential role of direct air capture (DAC) and its impact on policy costs and energy consumption. DAC is a technology that removes emissions directly from the atmosphere contributing to negative carbon emissions. We find that, with our modelling assumptions, limiting global temperature to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C is only possible when using DAC. Our results show that the DAC technology can play an important role in realising deep decarbonisation goals and in the reduction of regional and global mitigation costs with stringent targets. DAC acts a substitute to Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the stringent scenarios.

The special interest is in nanosized solid particles. The effect of an open channel filter on particle emissions of a modern heavy-duty diesel engine (MAN D2066 LF31, model year 2006) was studied. Here, the authors show that the open channel filter made from metal screen efficiently reduced the number of the smallest particles and, notably, the number and mass concentration of soot particles. The filter used in this study reached 78% particle mass reduction over the European Steady Cycle. Considering the size-segregated number concentration reduction, the collection efficiency was over 95% for particles smaller than 10 nm. The diffusion is the dominant collection mechanism in small particle sizes, thus the collection efficiency decreased as particle size increased, attaining 50% at 100 nm. The overall particle number reduction was 66\u201399%, and for accumulation-mode particles the number concentration reduction was 62\u201369%, both depending on the engine load.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "8b9351cf274b8ffbda6a1f1d3a2de269cfeeb15e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "269577035", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2015.04.007", "CorpusId": 92550794}, "title": "Carbon negative oil: A pathway for CO2 emission reduction goals", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "e9495d9db519859ae9fdcd2ce7c9b373d28e04eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998830668", "DOI": "10.1021/CM020040X", "CorpusId": 94878592}, "title": "Room-Temperature Synthesis and Characterization of Nanocrystalline CdS, ZnS, and CdxZn1-xS", "abstract": "A novel and simple chemical reduction route at room temperature is described to synthesize nanocrystalline CdS, ZnS, and CdxZn1-xS.
