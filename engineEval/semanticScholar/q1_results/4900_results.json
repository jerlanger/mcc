We have developed a model to assess the impact on GHG emissions of a growth of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity.

The impact of growth is to delay net GHG emission reductions by around 4 and 9 years in the Indian and German scenarios receptively. This dynamic approach quantifies the benefit of technologies with a lower GHG footprint in achieving rapid GHG emission reductions. In addition, short lifetime PV technologies, with a low GHG footprint, such as organic PV, can show greater emission reductions despite a higher levelised global warming potential (gCO2eq per kWh).

The former policy levies a quantity-based, the latter an emission based duty on imports from non-abating countries. In a stylised two-country model we demonstrate that the policies address both problems.

In an ischaemic territory, irreversible damage progresses over time from the centre of the most severe flow reduction to the periphery with less disturbed perfusion. This centrifugal progression of irreversible tissue damage is characterised by a complex cascade of interconnected electrophysiological, molecular, metabolic and perfusion disturbances. Waves of depolarisations, the peri infarct spreading depressions, inducing activation of ion pumps and liberation of excitatory transmitters play an important role in the drastically increased metabolic demand during reduced oxygen supply causing hypoxic tissue changes and lactacidosis, which further damage the tissue. Positron emission tomography allows the quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, the regional metabolic rate for oxygen and the regional oxygen extraction fraction, which can be used to identify regions with a critical reduction in these physiologic variables as indicators of penumbra and irreversible damage within ischaemic territories in animal models and patients with stroke. These positron emission tomography methods require arterial blood sampling and due to the complex logistics involved, are limited for routine application. Therefore, newer tracers were developed for the noninvasive detection of irreversible tissue damage (flumazenil) and of hypoxic tissue changes (fluoromisonidazole). As a widely applicable clinical tool, diffusion/perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is used; the \u2018mismatch\u2019 between perfusion and diffusion changes serves as a surrogate marker of the penumbra. However, in comparative studies of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, diffusion-weighted imaging showed a high false-positive rate of irreversible damage, and the perfusion-weighted\u2013diffusion-weighted mismatch overestimated the penumbra as defined by positron emission tomography. Advanced analytical procedures of magnetic resonance imaging data may improve the reliability of these surrogate markers but should be validated with quantitative procedures.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "732f8ed4c87b3c7a0fa23d819d945ee124757ec7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980568657", "DOI": "10.1002/EP.670100116", "CorpusId": 93939379}, "title": "Application of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology for NOx reduction from refinery combustion sources", "abstract": "Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied as a NOx abatement technique for stationary sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in Japan since the early 1970s.

Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N2O\u2010reducers (nosZII) was related to the potential capacity of the soil to act as a N2O sink. However, little is known about how this group responds to different agricultural practices. Here, we investigated how N2O\u2010producers and N2O\u2010reducers were affected by agricultural practices across a range of cropping systems in order to evaluate the consequences for N2O emissions. The abundance of both ammonia\u2010oxidizers and denitrifiers was quantified by real\u2010time qPCR, and the diversity of nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Denitrification and nitrification potential activities as well as in situ N2O emissions were also assessed. Overall, greatest differences in microbial activity, diversity, and abundance were observed between sites rather than between agricultural practices at each site. To better understand the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to the in situ N2O emissions, we subdivided more than 59,000 field measurements into fractions from low to high rates. We found that the low N2O emission rates were mainly explained by variation in soil properties (up to 59%), while the high rates were explained by variation in abundance and diversity of microbial communities (up to 68%). Notably, the diversity of the nosZII clade but not of the nosZI clade was important to explain the variation of in situ N2O emissions.

SIA concentrations, which contribute to about 50% of the PM10 concentration in northwestern Europe, have been studied by means of several model runs for different emission scenarios. SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions have been varied within a domain covering Germany and within a domain covering Europe. It was confirmed that the response of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium concentrations and deposition fluxes of S and N to SO 2, NOx and NH3 emission changes is non-linear. The deviation from linearity was found to be lower for total deposition fluxes of S and N than for SIA concentrations. Furthermore, the study has shown that incorporating explicit cloud chemistry in the model adds non-linear responses to the system. It significantly modifies the response of modelled SIA concentrations and S and N deposition fluxes to changes in precursor emissions.

The simulation is for a day with relatively high electricity demand and accounts for transmission constraints. In addition to the lowering of the NOx emissions, there are co-benefits of the redispatching of generation from coal to natural gas, including reductions in the emissions of sulfur oxides (24%\u201071%), Hg (16%\u201082%) and CO2 (8.8%\u201022%).

The objective of the scheduling is to maximize the generation profits, which are determined by the electricity sales revenue, the generating cost, and the emissions penalty over the planning horizon. Using a piecewise linear function to express the variable penalty factor, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model.

The essential variability can be achieved by fully variable mechanical valve trains or mechatronic systems both showing a robust running behavior in emissions and cyclic fluctuations. The camshaft driven mechanical system is based on the technology of the BMW Double-VANOS system. An additional variability makes it possible to shift the valve lift continuously in order to control the valve closing. The highest variability is given by a system with each valve being controlled seperatly. The electromechanical valve train enables the optimised timing of the individual valve offering a reduction in fuel consumption by about 10 per cent and a additional peak torque of 5 per cent.

As a result, the methodology omits factors that are crucial in determining current emissions, and has no mechanism to assess the potential impact of future climate and land\u2010use change. Scotland is used as a case study to illustrate the development of a new methodology, which retains the simple structure of the IPCC tier 1 methodology, but incorporates crop\u2010 and climate\u2010dependent emission factors (EFs). It also includes a factor to account for the effect of soil compaction because of trampling by grazing animals. These factors are based on recent field studies in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK. Under current conditions, the new methodology produces significantly higher estimates of annual N2O emissions than the IPCC default methodology, almost entirely because of the increased contribution of grazed pasture. Total emissions from applied fertilizer and N deposited by grazing animals are estimated at 10\u2003662\u2003t\u2003N2O\u2010N\u2003yr\u22121 using the newly derived EFs, as opposed to 6\u2003796\u2003t\u2003N2O\u2010N\u2003yr\u22121 using the IPCC default EFs. On a spatial basis, emission levels are closer to those calculated using field observations and detailed soil modelling than to estimates made using the IPCC default methodology.

The new methodology is also applied in conjunction with scenarios for future climate\u2010 and land\u2010use patterns, to assess how these emissions may change in the future. The results suggest that by 2080, Scottish N2O emissions may increase by up to 14%, depending on the climate scenario, if fertilizer and land management practices remain unchanged.

However, over much of China, aerosol pollution scatters and absorbs sunlight, significantly reducing surface solar radiation suitable for PV electricity generation. We evaluate the impact of aerosols on PV generation and find aerosol-related annual average reductions in eastern China to be more than 20%. In winter, aerosols have comparable impacts to clouds over eastern provinces. Improving air quality in China would increase efficiency of solar PV generation. As a positive feedback, increased PV efficiency and deployment would further reduce air pollutant emissions as well. Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is expanding rapidly in China, with total capacity projected to be 400 GW by 2030. However, severe aerosol pollution over China reduces solar radiation reaching the surface. We estimate the aerosol impact on solar PV electricity generation at the provincial and regional grid levels in China. Our approach is to examine the 12-year (2003\u20132014) average reduction in point-of-array irradiance (POAI) caused by aerosols in the atmosphere. We apply satellite-derived surface irradiance data from the NASA Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) with a PV performance model (PVLIB-Python) to calculate the impact of aerosols and clouds on POAI. Our findings reveal that aerosols over northern and eastern China, the most polluted regions, reduce annual average POAI by up to 1.5 kWh/m2 per day relative to pollution-free conditions, a decrease of up to 35%. Annual average reductions of POAI over both northern and eastern China are about 20\u201325%. We also evaluate the seasonal variability of the impact and find that aerosols in this region are as important as clouds in winter. Furthermore, we find that aerosols decrease electricity output of tracking PV systems more than those with fixed arrays: over eastern China, POAI is reduced by 21% for fixed systems at optimal angle and 34% for two-axis tracking systems.

Previous tests have suggested that reducing the delay between the diesel and natural gas injections, increasing the injection pressure, or adjusting the combustion timing have individually achieved substantial emissions benefits. To investigate the effectiveness of combining these techniques, and of using them over a wide range of operating conditions, a series of tests were carried out. The first set of tests investigated the interactions between these effects and the EGR fraction. For all the gaseous emissions, substantial interactions were found between the EGR level, combustion timing, and diesel-natural gas injection delay.

The calculated average emissions were used together with food consumption statistics and literature data on imported products to estimate trends in per capita emissions from animal food consumption. Total life cycle emissions from the Swedish livestock production were around 8.5 Mt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) in 1990 and emissions decreased to 7.3 Mt CO2e in 2005 (14% reduction). Around two-thirds of the emission cut was explained by more efficient production (less GHG emission per product unit) and one-third was due to a reduced animal production. The average GHG emissions per product unit until the farm-gate were reduced by 20% for dairy, 15% for pork and 23% for chicken meat, unchanged for eggs and increased by 10% for beef. A larger share of the average beef was produced from suckler cows in cow-calf systems in 2005 due to the decreasing dairy cow herd, which explains the increased emissions for the average beef in 2005. The overall emission cuts from the livestock sector were a result of several measures taken in farm production, for example increased milk yield per cow, lowered use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers in grasslands, reduced losses of ammonia from manure and a switch to biofuels for heating in chicken houses. In contrast to production, total GHG emissions from the Swedish consumption of animal products increased by around 22% between 1990 and 2005. This was explained by strong growth in meat consumption based mainly on imports, where growth in beef consumption especially was responsible for most emission increase over the 15-year period. Swedish GHG emissions caused by consumption of animal products reached around 1.1 t CO2e per capita in 2005. The emission cuts necessary for meeting a global temperature-increase target of 2\u00b0 might imply a severe constraint on the long-term global consumption of animal food.

We investigated the use of percutaneous LV EMM to assess the efficacy of myocardial gene transfer (GTx) of naked plasmid DNA encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor (phVEGF165), administered during surgery by direct myocardial injection in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia. Methods and ResultsA total of 13 consecutive patients (8 men, mean age 60.1\u00b12.3 years) with chronic stable angina due to angiographically documented coronary artery disease, all of whom had failed conventional therapy (drugs, PTCA, and/or CABG), were treated with direct myocardial injection of phVEGF165 via a minithoracotomy. Foci of ischemic myocardium were identified on LV EMM by preserved viability associated with an impairment in linear local shortening. Myocardial viability, defined by mean unipolar and bipolar voltage recordings \u22655 and \u22652 mV, respectively, did not change significantly after GTx. Analysis of linear local shortening in areas of myocardial ischemia, however, disclosed significant improvement after (15.26\u00b10.98%) versus before (9.94\u00b11.53%, P =0.004) phVEGF165 GTx. The area of ischemic myocardium was consequently reduced from 6.45\u00b11.37 cm2 before GTx to 0.95\u00b10.41 cm2 after GTx (P =0.001). These findings corresponded to improved perfusion scores calculated from single-photon emission CT\u2013sestamibi myocardial perfusion scans recorded at rest (7.4\u00b12.1 before GTx versus 4.5\u00b11.4 after GTx, P =0.009) and after pharmacological stress (12.8\u00b12.7 before GTx versus 8.5\u00b11.7 after GTx, P =0.047). ConclusionsThe results of EMM constitute objective evidence that phVEGF165 GTx augments perfusion of ischemic myocardium.

We present the results from an 8-year tropospheric chemistry reanalysis for the period 2005\u20132012 obtained by assimilating multiple data sets from the OMI, MLS, TES, and MOPITT satellite instruments. The reanalysis calculation was conducted using a global chemical transport model and an ensemble Kalman filter technique that simultaneously optimises the chemical concentrations of various species and emissions of several precursors. The optimisation of both the concentration and the emission fields is an efficient method to correct the entire tropospheric profile and its year-to-year variations, and to adjust various tracers chemically linked to the species assimilated. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite, and ozonesonde observations demonstrate the quality of the analysed O3, NO2, and CO concentrations on regional and global scales and for both seasonal and year-to-year variations from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. The data assimilation statistics imply persistent reduction of model error and improved representation of emission variability, but they also show that discontinuities in the availability of the measurements lead to a degradation of the reanalysis. The decrease in the number of assimilated measurements increased the ozonesonde-minus-analysis difference after 2010 and caused spurious variations in the estimated emissions. The Northern/Southern Hemisphere OH ratio was modified considerably due to the multiple-species assimilation and became closer to an observational estimate, which played an important role in propagating observational information among various chemical fields and affected the emission estimates.

We find that the introduction of assumptions developed by a group of \u2018bottom-up\u2019 modelers for the LEESS scenarios into a \u2018top-down\u2019 model, the Edmonds-Reilly-Barns Model, leads to \u2018top down\u2019 emissions trajectories similar to those of the LEESS. The cumulative effect of advanced energy technologies is to reduce annual emissions from fossil fuel use to levels which stabilize atmospheric concentrations below 550 ppmv. While all energy technologies play roles, the introduction of advanced biomass energy production technology is particularly important. The consideration of all greenhouse related anthropogenic emissions, and in particular sulfur dioxide, is found to be important. We find that the consideration of sulfur dioxide emissions coupled to rapid reductions in carbon dioxide emissions leads to higher global mean temperatures prior to 2050 than in the reference case. This result is due to the short-term cooling impact of sulfate aerosols, which dominates the long-term warming impact of CO2 and CH4 in the years prior to 2050. We also show that damage calculations which use only mean global temperature and income may be underestimating damages by up to a factor of five.

Strict emission controls were implemented in Beijing and adjacent provinces to ensure good air quality during the 2015 China Victory Day parade. Here, we conducted synchronous measurements of submicron aerosols (PM1) at ground level and 260\u202fm on a meteorological tower by using a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor, respectively, in Beijing from 22\u00a0August to 30\u00a0September. Our results showed that the average PM1 concentrations are 19.3 and 14.8\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 at ground level and 260\u202fm, respectively, during the control period (20\u00a0August\u20133\u00a0September), which are 57 and 50\u202f% lower than those after the control period (4\u201330\u00a0September). Organic aerosols (OAs) dominated PM1 during the control period at both ground level and 260\u202fm (55 and 53\u202f%, respectively), while their contribution showed substantial decreases (\u223c\u2009\u202f40\u202f%) associated with an increase in secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) after the parade, indicating a larger impact of emission controls on SIA than OA. Positive matrix factorization of OA further illustrated that primary OA (POA) showed similar decreases as secondary OA (SOA) at both ground level (40\u202f% vs. 42\u202f%) and 260\u202fm (35\u202f% vs. 36\u202f%).

Simulated PM concentrations show a strong negative correlation (i.e. R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.86) with regional wind speed, implying that reduced regional ventilation is likely associated with more stagnant conditions that cause severe pollutant episodes in South Korea.

Carbon dioxide emissions from wild and anthropogenic fires return the carbon absorbed by plants to the atmosphere, and decrease the sequestration of carbon by land ecosystems. Future climate warming will likely increase the frequency of fire-triggering drought, so that the future terrestrial carbon uptake will depend on how fires respond to altered climate variation. In this study, we modelled the role of fires in the global terrestrial carbon balance for 1901\u20132012, using the ORCHIDEE global vegetation model equipped with the SPITFIRE model. We conducted two simulations with and without the fire module being activated, using a static land cover. The simulated global fire carbon emissions for 1997\u20132009 are 2.1 Pg C yr\u22121, which is close to the 2.0 Pg C yr\u22121 as estimated by GFED3.1. The simulated land carbon uptake after accounting for emissions for 2003\u20132012 is 3.1 Pg C yr\u22121, which is within the uncertainty of the residual carbon sink estimation (2.8 \u00b1 0.8 Pg C yr\u22121). Fires are found to reduce the terrestrial carbon uptake by 0.32 Pg C yr\u22121 over 1901\u20132012, or 20% of the total carbon sink in a world without fire. The fire-induced land sink reduction (SRfire) is significantly correlated with climate variability, with larger sink reduction occurring in warm and dry years, in particular during El Nino events. Our results suggest a \"fire respiration partial compensation\". During the 10 lowest SRfire years (SRfire = 0.17 Pg C yr\u22121), fires mainly compensate for the heterotrophic respiration that would occur in a world without fire. By contrast, during the 10 highest SRfire fire years (SRfire = 0.49 Pg C yr\u22121), fire emissions far exceed their respiration partial compensation and create a larger reduction in terrestrial carbon uptake. Our findings have important implications for the future role of fires in the terrestrial carbon balance, because the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon will be diminished by future climate change characterized by increased frequency of droughts and extreme El Nino events.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "1ed212926c9e072826669737bee7f088382d33bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2233415723", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2006.9685623", "CorpusId": 6335009}, "title": "Learning and climate change", "abstract": "Abstract Learning\u2014i.e. the acquisition of new information that leads to changes in our assessment of uncertainty\u2014plays a prominent role in the international climate policy debate.

We conduct a base and five sensitivity simulations, in which sulfur emissions from each continent are tagged, to establish the source-receptor (S-R) relationship between EA sulfur emissions and sulfate concentrations over source and downwind regions. We find that from west to east across the North Pacific, EA sulfate contributes approximately 80%\u201320% of sulfate at the surface, but at least 50% at 500 hPa. Surface sulfate concentrations are dominated by local anthropogenic sources. Of the sulfate produced from sources other than local anthropogenic emissions (defined here as \"background\" sulfate), EA sources account for approximately 30%\u201350% (over the Western US) and 10%\u201320% (over the Eastern US). The surface concentrations of sulfate from EA sources over the Western US are highest in MAM (up to 0.15 \u03bcg/m 3 ), and lowest in DJF (less than 0.06 \u03bcg/m 3 ). Reducing EA SO 2 emissions will significantly decrease the spatial extent of the EA sulfate influence (represented by the areas where at least 0.1 \u03bcg m \u22123 of sulfate originates from EA) over the North Pacific both at the surface and at 500 hPa in all seasons, but the extent of influence is insensitive to emission increases, particularly in DJF and JJA. We find that EA sulfate concentrations over most downwind regions respond nearly linearly to changes in EA SO 2 emissions, but sulfate concentrations over the EA source region increase more slowly than SO 2 emissions, particularly at the surface and in winter, due to limited availability of oxidants (in particular of H 2 O 2 , which oxidizes SO 2 to sulfate in the aqueous phase). We find that similar estimates of the S-R relationship for trans-Pacific transport of EA sulfate would be obtained using either sensitivity (i.e., varying emissions from a region to examine the effects on downwind concentrations) or tagging techniques. Our findings suggest that future changes in EA sulfur emissions may cause little change in the sulfate-induced health impact over downwind continents.

N2 emissions exceeded N2O emissions by a factor of 5\u2009\u00b1\u20092 at 70% soil water holding capacity (WHC) and a factor of 55\u2009\u00b1\u200927 at 130% WHC.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of urea application on N2O emissions from pastoral soil. A closed soil chamber technique was used to measure the N2O emissions from a pasture which received either 0 (control) or 50 kg N ha\u20131 (as urea) per application during different seasons between 2003 and 2005. Overall, urea fertiliser application generally increased N2O fluxes above control levels for up to 30 days, but the duration for which N2O levels were elevated depended on the season. These increases in the N2O fluxes were largely caused by a combination of changes in the soil mineral N level due to urea application, and moisture content of soil in different seasons. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher during the winter and spring measurement periods when the soil water\u2010filled pore space (WFPS) was mostly above field capacity, and the emissions were lower during the summer and autumn measurement periods when the soil WFPS was below field capacity. The estimated N2O emission factors for urea ranged between 0 and 1.56% of the urea\u2010N applied, with a calculated average emission factor of 0.56%.

Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 results in a reduction in pH termed \"Ocean Acidification\" (OA). Comparatively little attention has been given to the effect of OA on the early life history stages of marine animals. Consequently, we investigated the effect of culture in CO2-acidified sea water (approx. 1200 ppm, i.e. average values predicted using IPCC 2007 A1F1 emissions scenarios for year 2100) on early larval stages of an economically important crustacean, the European lobster Homarus gammarus. Culture in CO2-acidified sea water did not significantly affect carapace length of H. gammarus. However, there was a reduction in carapace mass during the final stage of larval development in CO2-acidified sea water. This co-occurred with a reduction in exoskeletal mineral (calcium and magnesium) content of the carapace. As the control and high CO2 treatments were not undersaturated with respect to any of the calcium carbonate polymorphs measured, the physiological alterations we record are most likely the result of acidosis or hypercapnia interfering with normal homeostatic function, and not a direct impact on the carbonate supply-side of calcification per se. Thus despite there being no observed effect on survival, carapace length, or zoeal progression, OA related (indirect) disruption of calcification and carapace mass might still adversely affect the competitive fitness and recruitment success of larval lobsters with serious consequences for population dynamics and marine ecosystem function.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "2cf18e8e28350984643912f9a132bd056721536d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983461422", "DOI": "10.1021/ac900781d", "CorpusId": 25265053, "PubMed": "19691270"}, "title": "Potential sensing platform of silver nanoparticles embedded in functionalized silicate shell for nitroaromatic compounds.", "abstract": "A simple and new method to grow a pentagonally twinned structure of silver-silicate core-shell nanoparticles in aqueous environment at room temperature and its application in nitrobenzene (NB) sensing is described here.

For the developing economies, in particular, it is imperative to reduce such emissions in order to sustain the growth of the respective economies. However, for designing appropriate emission reduction policies, it is appropriate to identify the sectors which contribute the most to carbon dioxide emissions and dampen the growth of overall economy. Against this background, the key intention of this study was to examine the influence of carbon dioxide emissions generated from various sources on the economic progress in Pakistan between 1971 and 2017. This study is important for Pakistan to sustain its economic progress and enable the nation to comply with commitments of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. The econometric analysis conducted in this study considers a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model which is applied to ascertain the short- and long-run economic growth impacts associated with positive and negative shocks to CO2 emissions generated from various sources. The choice of this model is driven by its capacity to perform an asymmetric analysis which is relevant for suitable policy-making purposes. The overall results, in a nutshell, reveal that carbon dioxide emissions from Pakistan\u2019s transportation sector influence the country\u2019s economic progress. Positive shocks to such carbon dioxide emissions are originate to reduce economic progress in the long run while negative shocks are evidenced to boost economic growth both in the short and long run. In contrast, carbon dioxide emissions from other major sectors are found to be ineffective in influencing Pakistan's economic growth both in the short and long run. Hence, keeping into consideration the prospects of attaining sustainable economic growth, the Pakistan government must prioritize the implementation of CO2 emissions-inhibiting policies within the transportation sector. Simultaneously, the traditional fossil fuel dependency within this sector should also be phased out.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "9f27fe3d498af6313a7b1270ecfc6d348776d118", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2173073975", "DOI": "10.1080/08111140802311236", "CorpusId": 130984618}, "title": "Travel to Work in Australian Capital Cities, 1976\u20132006", "abstract": "This report uses data from 1976 to 2006 Australian censuses to identify the major trends in travel to work in Australia's capital cities over three decades.

The former federal government's Auslink funding program has exacerbated the problems identified in this report, because it is biased in favour of roads and against public transport. It needs to be replaced by a new 'mode-neutral' funding model which is tied to environmental outcomes, especially the reduction of greenhouse emissions.

Direct measurements show that ambient atmospheric particulate black carbon absorbs less solar radiation than theory suggested. Atmospheric black carbon (BC) warms Earth\u2019s climate, and its reduction has been targeted for near-term climate change mitigation. Models that include forcing by BC assume internal mixing with non-BC aerosol components that enhance BC absorption, often by a factor of ~2; such model estimates have yet to be clearly validated through atmospheric observations.

L. Zhang et al. (2012), in a recent report, compared model estimates with new observations of oxidized and particulate mercury species (Hg2+ and Hgp) in the Great Lakes region and found that the sum of Hg2+ and Hgp varied between a factor of 2 to 10 between measurements and model. They suggested too high emission inputs as Hg2+ and too fast oxidative conversion of Hg0 to Hg2+ and Hgp as possible causes. This study quantitatively explores measurement uncertainties in detail. These include sampling efficiency, composition of sample, interfering species and calibration errors. Model (Global/Regional Atmospheric Heavy Metals Model \u2013 GRAHM) sensitivity experiments are used to examine the consistency between various Hg measurements and speciation of Hg near emission sources to better understand the discrepancies between modelled and measured concentrations of Hg2+ and Hgp. We find that the ratio of Hg0, Hg2+ and Hgp in the emission inventories, measurements of surface air concentrations of oxidized Hg and measurements of wet deposition are currently inconsistent with each other in the vicinity of emission sources. Current speciation of Hg emissions suggests higher concentrations of Hg2+ in air and in precipitation near emission sources; however, measured air concentrations of Hg2+ and measured concentrations of Hg in precipitation are not found to be significantly elevated near emission sources compared to the remote regions. The averaged unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated and observed concentrations of Hg2+ is found to be reduced by 42% and for Hgp reduced by 40% for 21 North American sites investigated, when a ratio for Hg0 : Hg2+ : Hgp in the emissions is changed from 50 : 40 : 10 (as specified in the original inventories) to 90 : 8 : 2. Unbiased RMSE reductions near emissions sources in the eastern United States and Canada are found to be reduced by up to 58% for Hg2+. Significant improvement in the model simulated spatial distribution of wet deposition of mercury in North America is noticed with the modified Hg emission speciation. Measurement-related uncertainties leading to lower estimation of Hg2+ concentrations are 86%. Uncertainties yielding either to higher or lower Hg2+ concentrations are found to be 36%. Finally, anthropogenic emission uncertainties are 106% for Hg2+. Thus it appears that the identified uncertainties for model estimates related to mercury speciation near sources, uncertainties in measurement methodology and uncertainties in emissions can close the gap between modelled and observed estimates of oxidized mercury found in L. Zhang et al. (2012). Model sensitivity simulations show that the measured concentrations of oxidized mercury, in general, are too low to be consistent with measured wet deposition fluxes in North America. Better emission inventories (with respect to speciation), better techniques for measurements of oxidized species and knowledge of mercury reduction reactions in different environments (including in-plume) in all phases are needed for improving the mercury models.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "ce6d6b91ade174cf361101ee0c18b888e54946a8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016973827", "DOI": "10.1029/2007JG000569", "CorpusId": 18046687}, "title": "Methane production and bubble emissions from arctic lakes: Isotopic implications for source pathways and ages", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0This study reports an atmospheric methane (CH4) source term previously uncharacterized regarding strength and isotopic composition. Methane emissions from 14 Siberian lakes and 9 Alaskan lakes were characterized using stable isotopes (13C and D) and radiocarbon (14C) analyses. We classified ebullition (bubbling) into three categories (background, point sources, and hot spots) on the basis of fluxes, major gas concentrations, and isotopic composition. Point sources and hot spots had a strong association with thermokarst (thaw) erosion because permafrost degradation along lake margins releases ancient organic matter into anaerobic lake bottoms, fueling methanogenesis. With increasing ebullition rate, we observed increasing CH4 concentration of greater radiocarbon age, depletion of 13CCH4, and decreasing bubble N2 content. Microbial oxidation of methane was observed in bubbles that became trapped below and later within winter lake ice; however, oxidation appeared insignificant in bubbles sampled immediately after release from sediments. Methanogenic pathways differed among the bubble sources: CO2 reduction supported point source and hot spot ebullition to a large degree, while acetate fermentation appeared to contribute to background bubbling. To provide annual whole-lake and regional CH4 isofluxes for the Siberian lakes, we combined maps of bubble source distributions with long-term, continuous flux measurements and isotopic composition. In contrast to typical values used in inverse models of atmospheric CH4 for northern wetland sources (\u03b413CCH4 = \u221258\u2030, 14C age modern), which have not included northern lake ebullition as a source, we show that this large, new source of high-latitude CH4 from lakes is isotopically distinct (\u03b413CCH4 = \u221270\u2030, 14C age 16,500 years, for North Siberian lakes).", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "43831fe55d6fccbf90f109d5b70b6abe9d500044", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3090809821", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/ABBD02", "CorpusId": 225007240}, "title": "The CO2 reduction potential for the European industry via direct electrification of heat supply (power-to-heat)", "abstract": "The decarbonisation of industry is a bottleneck for EU's 2050 target of climate neutrality. Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity is at the core of this challenge; however, the aggregate electrification potential and resulting system-wide CO2 reductions for diverse industrial processes are unknown. Here, we present the results from a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of the energy use in eleven industrial sectors (accounting for 92% of Europe's industry CO2 emissions), and estimate the technological potential for industry electrification in three stages. 78% of the energy demand is electrifiable with technologies that are already established, while 99% electrification can be achieved with the addition of technologies currently under development. Such a deep electrification reduces CO2 emissions already based on the carbon intensity of today's electricity (~300 gCO2/kWhel). With an increasing decarbonisation of the power sector (IEA: 12 gCO2/kWhel in 2050), electrification could cut CO2 emissions by 78%, and almost entirely abate the energy-related CO2 emissions, reducing the industry bottleneck to only residual process emissions. Despite its decarbonisation potential, the extent to which direct electrification will be deployed in industry remains uncertain and depends on the relative cost of electric technologies compared to other low-carbon options.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "556fbb2f87165ca8554e03c645d33dad2698b9e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2102510225", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-15-11861-2015", "CorpusId": 16598678}, "title": "How consistent are top-down hydrocarbon emissions based on formaldehyde observations from GOME-2 and OMI?", "abstract": "The vertical columns of formaldehyde (HCHO) retrieved from two satellite instruments, the Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument-2 (GOME-2) on Metop-A and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura, are used to constrain global emissions of HCHO precursors from open fires, vegetation and human activities in the year 2010. To this end, the emissions are varied and optimized using the adjoint model technique in the IMAGESv2 global CTM (chemistry-transport model) on a monthly basis and at the model resolution. Given the different local overpass times of GOME-2 (09:30 LT) and OMI (13:30 LT), the simulated diurnal cycle of HCHO columns is investigated and evaluated against ground-based optical measurements at 7 sites in Europe, China and Africa. The modelled diurnal cycle exhibits large variability, reflecting competition between photochemistry and emission variations, with noon or early afternoon maxima at remote locations (oceans) and in regions dominated by anthropogenic emissions, late afternoon or evening maxima over fire scenes, and midday minima in isoprene-rich regions. The agreement between simulated and ground-based columns is found to be generally better in summer (with a clear afternoon maximum at mid-latitude sites) than in winter, and the annually averaged ratio of afternoon to morning columns is slightly higher in the model (1.126) than in the ground-based measurements (1.043). \r\n\r\nThe anthropogenic VOC (volatile organic compound) sources are found to be weakly constrained by the inversions on the global scale, mainly owing to their generally minor contribution to the HCHO columns, except over strongly polluted regions, like China. The OMI-based inversion yields total flux estimates over China close to the bottom-up inventory (24.6 vs. 25.5 in the a priori) with, however, pronounced increases in the Northeast China and reductions in the south. Lower fluxes are estimated based on GOME-2 HCHO columns (20.6 TgVOC), in particular over the Northeast, likely reflecting mismatches between the observed and the modelled diurnal cycle in this region. \r\n\r\nThe resulting biogenic and pyrogenic flux estimates from both optimizations generally show a good degree of consistency. A reduction of the global annual biogenic emissions of isoprene is derived, by 9 and by 13% according to GOME-2 and OMI, respectively, compared to the a priori estimate of 363 Tg in 2010. The reduction is largest (up to 25\u201340%) in the Southeastern US, in accordance with earlier studies. The GOME-2 and OMI satellite columns suggest a global pyrogenic flux decrease by 36 and 33%, respectively, compared to the GFEDv3 inventory. This decrease is especially pronounced over tropical forests such as Amazonia and Thailand/Myanmar, and is supported by comparisons with IASI CO observations. In contrast to these flux reductions, the emissions due to harvest waste burning are strongly enhanced in the Northeastern China plain in June (by ca. 70% in June according to OMI) as well as over Indochina in March. Sensitivity inversions showed robustness of the inferred estimates, which were found to lie within 7% of the standard inversion results at the global scale.", "year": 2015}]}
