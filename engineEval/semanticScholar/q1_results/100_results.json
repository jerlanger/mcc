In addition, in recent years, there is evidence of a shift in consumer preferences in favour of low-carbon products. Using a theoretical model, where the shift in consumer preferences is explicitly incorporated, we evaluate the impact of carbon emission reduction cost-sharing on supply chain profit. In our model, consumers are willing to pay a higher price for low-carbon products and hence the retailer considers sharing the cost of carbon emission reduction with the manufacturer. Our model also includes a carbon trading mechanism. We identify a range of carbon emission reduction cost-sharing such that both supply chain enterprises are better-off. We find that, while achieving the aim of carbon emission reduction, consumer preference for low-carbon products can benefit both supply chain enterprises.

In this paper, we propose a systematic design method for a cold-start supervisory control algorithm based on the Dynamic Programming (DP) methodology. First, a system-level parallel HEV model is developed to efficiently predict tailpipe emissions as well as fuel economy.The optimal control problem for minimization of cold-start emissions and fuel consumption is then solved via DP. Since DP solution cannot be directly implemented as a real-time controller, more useful control strategies are extracted from DP solution over the entire state space via the comprehensive extraction method. The DP results indicate that the engine on/off, gear-shift, and power-split strategies must be properly adjusted to achieve fast catalyst warm-up with minimal cold-start engine-out emissions.

Current strategy of replacing coal-based UCH with natural gas-based UCH is expected to decrease CO(2) emissions by 63.5%.

The particle size is characterised using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The Nano particles (100 mg/l) were dispersed in the fuel by an ultrasonicator with the assistance of optimised surfactant concentration. It was noticed that the addition of Nano cobalt oxide additive reduced specific energy consumption at part load and full load conditions. Cobalt oxide acts asan oxygen buffer which improves the combustion and reduces the emissions. The introduction of Nano-fuel additive resulted in maximum reduction of about 60% in unburnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) and 50% reduction in carbon monoxide at full load and 75% load respectively for neat biodiesel operation. It was observed that NOx emission were higher at neat biodiesel operation compared with neat diesel operation and it was countered by introduction of Nano-fuel additive which resulted in 45% reduction in NOx emission at the same biodiesel operation. Magnalium particles are highly energetic materials and it reduces the energy consumption and improves the thermal efficiency, the reason is that, the additive releases energy during combustion, in addition to the liquid fuel.

Public transit is more energy efficient on major urban corridors. Some transit improvements, such as bus lanes and faster loading, increase operating efficiency. High quality transit can leverage additional energy savings by stimulating transit-oriented development and by supporting other energy conservation strategies such as pricing reforms. High quality transit can provide other savings and benefits in addition to energy conservation and emission reductions.

China, known as the world\u2019s top emitter of gaseous ammonia, plans to control ammonia emissions to mitigate the haze pollution that has recently emerged. However, the complex side effects are still unclear. By integrating a chemical transport model, nationwide measurements, and a sophisticated ammonia emission model, we find that ammonia emission control would significantly aggravate acid rain pollution, thereby offsetting the benefit from reduced fine particle pollution and nitrogen deposition. Our work suggests that region-specific ammonia-control strategies provide a more rational and effective way to achieve the dual benefits of protecting human and ecosystem health in China. China has been experiencing fine particle (i.e., aerodynamic diameters \u2264 2.5 \u00b5m; PM2.5) pollution and acid rain in recent decades, which exert adverse impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Recently, ammonia (i.e., NH3) emission reduction has been proposed as a strategic option to mitigate haze pollution. However, atmospheric NH3 is also closely bound to nitrogen deposition and acid rain, and comprehensive impacts of NH3 emission control are still poorly understood in China. In this study, by integrating a chemical transport model with a high-resolution NH3 emission inventory, we find that NH3 emission abatement can mitigate PM2.5 pollution and nitrogen deposition but would worsen acid rain in China. Quantitatively, a 50% reduction in NH3 emissions achievable by improving agricultural management, along with a targeted emission reduction (15%) for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can alleviate PM2.5 pollution by 11\u221217% primarily by suppressing ammonium nitrate formation. Meanwhile, nitrogen deposition is estimated to decrease by 34%, with the area exceeding the critical load shrinking from 17% to 9% of China\u2019s terrestrial land. Nevertheless, this NH3 reduction would significantly aggravate precipitation acidification, with a decrease of as much as 1.0 unit in rainfall pH and a corresponding substantial increase in areas with heavy acid rain. An economic evaluation demonstrates that the worsened acid rain would partly offset the total economic benefit from improved air quality and less nitrogen deposition.

The annual emission trends of the four largest megacities, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen are -0.76 \u00b1 0.29%, 0.69 \u00b1 0.27%, -4.46 \u00b1 1.22%, and -7.18 \u00b1 2.88% yr(-1), considerably lower than the regional averages or surrounding rural regions. These results appear to suggest that a number of factors, including emission control measures of thermal power plants, increased hydro-power usage, vehicle emission regulations, and closure or migration of high-emission industries, have significantly reduced or even reversed the increasing trend of NOx emissions in more economically developed megacities and southern coastal regions, but their effects are not as significant in other major cities or less economically developed regions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "3fd99abbf04c6964c0dd9ba61993830e5c731142", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2372940210", "CorpusId": 112166446}, "title": "Multi-objective Unit Commitment Fuzzy Modeling and Optimization for Energy-saving and Emission Reduction", "abstract": "It is necessary to cut green house emission and develop energy-saving and emission-reducing in power generation scheduling.

The use of PFC gases in these processes is crucial to the production of semiconductor devices, as there are no effective substitutes that can be utilized. Although PFC emissions caused by the semiconductor industry are a tiny fraction of all industry greenhouse gases emissions, the world's semiconductor manufacturers, assembled in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and its affiliated associations, have officially agreed to voluntarily reduce atmospheric emissions of PFCs to 10% below baseline levels in 2010. The WSC has established a reporting program to track PFC emissions by the present five semiconductor manufacturing associations (USA, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Korea). Data released by the WSC today show that the 2008 PFC emissions in most regions are already below the target set for 2010. This cooperative effort by the members of the WSC to reduce PFC emissions is an excellent example of what can be accomplished by collaboration. Because the PFC emission reduction program is considered to be pre-competitive, members freely share information on techniques and strategies. One of the key success factors has also been the strong involvement of equipment and gas suppliers to the semiconductor industry. Key measures that have contributed to substantially reduce PFC emissions are, among others, installation of dedicated post process tool PFC abatement, and application of NF3 gas in combination with so-called remote plasma in chamber cleans. The latter affords a highly efficient process alternative for the semiconductor industry with minimal PFC emission footprint, since the NF3 is utilized with better than 98% conversion efficiency. A gradual trend is visible, i.e. more advanced tools and facilities with relatively low emissions are supplanting relatively old tools and facilities with relatively high emission profiles. Presently, the global semiconductor industry is considering whether and how PFC emissions can be further reduced post-2010. A new global agreement should include other relevant regions with substantial semiconductor production, such as China and Singapore. Such discussions have already commenced. One of the key elements in a new agreement is harmonization of regional reporting. Moreover, it should be emphasized that semiconductor manufacture is no longer the sole or even the largest industry that makes use of PFCs.

Among the number of lean-NOx reduction technologies, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by NH3 over Cu- and Fe-ion exchanged zeolite catalysts has been extensively studied over the past 30+ years. Despite the significant advances in developing a viable practical zeolite-based catalyst for lean NOx reduction, the insufficient hydrothermal stabilities of the zeolite structures considered cast doubts about their real-world applicability. During the past decade renewed interest in zeolite-based lean NOx reduction was spurred by the discovery of the very high activity of Cu-SSZ-13 (and the isostructural Cu-SAPO-34) in the NH3-SCR of NOx. These new, small-pore zeolite-based catalysts not only exhibited very high NOx conversion and N2 selectivity, but also exhibited exceptionally high hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In this review we summarize the key discoveries of the past \u223c5 years that led to the introduction of these catalysts into practical applications. This review first briefly discusses the structure and preparation of the CHA structure-based zeolite catalysts, and then summarizes the key learnings of the rather extensive (but not complete) characterisation work. Then we summarize the key findings of reaction kinetic studies, and provide some mechanistic details emerging from these investigations. At the end of the review we highlight some of the issues that still need to be addressed in automotive exhaust control catalysis.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "96370b15965ecbcd9e23fb680fe9e7cdafaf02ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2760460369", "PubMedCentral": "5770696", "DOI": "10.1002/advs.201700275", "CorpusId": 13655131, "PubMed": "29375961"}, "title": "Progress and Perspective of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Renewable Carbonaceous Fuels and Chemicals", "abstract": "The worldwide unrestrained emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) has caused serious environmental pollution and climate change issues.

The CO2 emission will be heavily influenced with increasing steel production in the world. It is of great interest to evaluate and decrease the specific CO2 emission and to find out feasible solutions for its reduction. In this work, a process integration method focusing on the integrated steel plant system has been applied. In this paper, an optimization model, which can be used to evaluate CO2 emission for the integrated steel plant system, is presented. Two application cases of analysing CO2 emission reduction possibilities are included in the paper. Furthermore, the possibility to apply the model for a specific integrated steel plant has been discussed. The research work on the optimization of energy and CO2 emission has shown that it is possible to create a combined optimization tool that is powerful to assess the system performance from several aspects for the steel plant.

Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade, we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. We find that the emissions from the production of traded goods and services have increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%). Most developed countries have increased their consumption-based emissions faster than their territorial emissions, and non\u2013energy-intensive manufacturing had a key role in the emission transfers. The net emission transfers via international trade from developing to developed countries increased from 0.4 Gt CO2 in 1990 to 1.6 Gt CO2 in 2008, which exceeds the Kyoto Protocol emission reductions. Our results indicate that international trade is a significant factor in explaining the change in emissions in many countries, from both a production and consumption perspective.

The supply equation takes into account the institutional quality of the country as well as consumer preferences for environmental quality. The results indicate that, all else equal, output growth would have increased CO2 industrial emissions in the Central and Eastern European countries in our sample by 31% between 1995 and 2003, and the composition effect corresponded to an increase of 8.4% of these emissions.

The North China Plain has been identified as a significant hotspot of ammonia\n(NH3) due to extensive agricultural activities. Satellite\nobservations suggest a significant increase of about 30\u2009% in tropospheric\ngas-phase NH3 concentrations in this area during 2008\u20132016.\nHowever, the estimated NH3 emissions decreased slightly by 7\u2009%\nbecause of changes in Chinese agricultural practices, i.e., the transition in\nfertilizer types from ammonium carbonate fertilizer to urea, and in the\nlivestock rearing system from free-range to intensive farming. We note that\nthe emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) have rapidly declined by\nabout 60\u2009% over the recent few years.

The simulations for the period\n2008\u20132016 demonstrate that the annual average sulfate concentrations\ndecreased by about 50\u2009%, which significantly weakens the formation of\nammonium sulfate and increases the average proportions of gas-phase\nNH3 within the total NH3 column concentrations from\n26\u2009% (2008) to 37\u2009% (2016). By fixing SO2 emissions of 2008\nin those multi-year simulations, the increasing trend of the tropospheric\nNH3 concentrations is not observed.

These European anthropogenic sulphur emissions have been steadily decreasing over the last twenty-five years, amounting from about 55 Tg SO 2 in 1980 to 15 Tg SO 2 in 2004. The uncertainty in sulphur emission estimates for individual countries and years are documented to range between 3% and 25%. The relative contribution of European emissions to global anthropogenic sulphur emissions has been halved during this period. Based on annual emission reports from European countries, three emission reduction regimes have been identified. The period 1980\u20131989 is characterized by low annual emission reductions (below 5% reduction per year and 20% for the whole period) and is dominated by emission reductions in Western Europe. The period 1990\u20131999 is characterised by high annual emission reductions (up to 11% reduction per year and 54% for the whole period), most pronounced in Central and Eastern Europe. The annual emission reductions in the period 2000\u20132004 are medium to low (below 6% reduction per year and 17% for the whole period) and reflect the unified Europe, with equally large reductions in both East and West. The sulphur emission reduction has been largest in the sector Combustion in energy and transformation industries , but substantial decreases are also seen in the Non-industrial combustion plants together with the sectors Industrial combustion and Industrial production processes . The majority of European countries have reduced their emissions by more than 60% between 1990 and 2004, and one quarter have already achieved sulphur emission reductions higher than 80%. At European level, the total sulphur target for 2010 set in the Gothenburg Protocol (16 Tg) has apparently already been met by 2004. However, still half of the Parties to the Gothenburg Protocol have to reduce further their sulphur emissions in order to attain their individual country total emission targets for 2010.

The experiment demonstrated that, under industry-relevant conditions, the inhibitor persistently decreased by 30% enteric methane emissions, without negatively affecting animal productivity. The spared methane energy was partially used for tissue synthesis, which led to a greater body weight gain by the inhibitor-treated cows. If adopted, this mitigation practice could lead to a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the ruminant livestock sector. A quarter of all anthropogenic methane emissions in the United States are from enteric fermentation, primarily from ruminant livestock.

Methane emission per unit of feed dry matter intake or per unit of energy-corrected milk were also about 30% less for the 3NOP-treated cows. On average, the body weight gain of 3NOP-treated cows was 80% greater than control cows during the 12-wk experiment. The experiment demonstrated that the methane inhibitor 3NOP, applied at 40 to 80 mg/kg feed dry matter, decreased methane emissions from high-producing dairy cows by 30% and increased body weight gain without negatively affecting feed intake or milk production and composition.

Concerns over the environmental impact of emissions from manure management have resulted in research efforts focusing on emission abatement. However, questions regarding the successful abatement of manure-related emissions remain. This study uses a meta-analytical approach comprising 89 peer-reviewed studies to quantify emission reduction potentials of abatement options for liquid manure management chains from cattle and pigs. Analyses of emission reductions highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between emissions. Only three out of the eight abatement options considered (frequent removal of manure, anaerobic digesters, and manure acidification) reduced ammonia (3-60%), nitrous oxide (21-55%), and methane (29-74%) emissions simultaneously, whereas in all other cases, tradeoffs were identified. The results demonstrate that a shift from single-stage emission abatement options towards a whole-chain perspective is vital in reducing overall emissions along the manure management chain. The study also identifies some key elements like proper clustering, reporting of influencing factors, and explicitly describing assumptions associated with abatement options that can reduce variability in emission reduction estimates. Prioritization of abatement options according to their functioning can help to determine low-risk emission reduction options, specifically options that alter manure characteristics (e.g., reduced protein diets, anaerobic digestion, or slurry acidification).

The results indicate that, first, when carbon emission reduction capacity, responsibility and potential are considered for the comprehensive index of carbon emission quota allocation, the mitigation responsibility plays a relatively higher role than other two indicators. Second, all of the subjective, objective and linear combination weighting methods can be used for effective allocation of carbon emission quotas, and the former two methods have less advantage in light of efficiency.

The aim of this study was to evaluate emissions and the technical reduction potential of SO2, NOx, CO, HC and PM from waterborne traffic in Finland and in marine areas near Finland in 2000 and 2015. The energy consumption of ships in 2000 was estimated based on statistics mapping ship movements in the ports of Finland, Russia, Estonia and Sweden. Combined with emission factors, this data was used as a basis for evaluating the total amount of emissions. Emissions in 2015 were calculated based on predicted growth rates in ship traffic and four different reduction technology scenarios. In 2000 the ship-based SO2 and NOx emissions on sea routes totalled 36000 and 107000 tonnes, respectively. Current international regulations have little impact on emission rates in the studied marine areas.

Brazil, China and India together account for about 20% of today\u2019s CO2 emissions. We analyse the case in which there is no international agreement on emission reduction targets, but countries do have domestic targets, and trade permits across borders. We contrast two scenarios. In one scenario, Brazil, China and India adopt their business as usual emissions as their target. In this scenario, there are substantial exports of emission permits from developing to developed countries, and substantial economic gains for all. In the second scenario, Brazil, China and India reduce their emissions target so that they have no net economic gain from permit trade. Here, developing countries do not accept responsibility for climate change (as they bear no net costs), but they do contribute to emission reduction policy by refusing to make money out of it. Adopting such break-even targets can be done at minor cost to developed and developing countries (roughly $2 bln/year each in extra costs and foregone benefits), while developing countries are still slightly better off than in the case without international emissions trade. This result is robust to variations in scenarios and parameters. It contrasts with Stewart and Wiener (2003) who propose granting \u201chot air\u201d to developing countries to seduce them to accept targets.

A global chemistry-climate model has been used to study the impacts of pollutants released by agriculture on fine-particulate matter (PM2.5), with a focus on Europe, North America, East and South Asia. Simulations reveal that a relatively strong reduction in PM2.5 levels can be achieved by decreasing agricultural emissions, notably of ammonia (NH3) released from fertilizer use and animal husbandry. The absolute impact on PM2.5 reduction is strongest in East Asia, even for small emission decreases. Conversely, over Europe and North America, aerosol formation is not immediately limited by the availability of ammonia. Nevertheless, reduction of NH3 can also substantially decrease PM2.5 concentrations over the latter regions, especially when emissions are abated systematically. Our results document how reduction of agricultural emissions decreases aerosol pH due to the depletion of aerosol ammonium, which affects particle liquid phase and heterogeneous chemistry. Further, it is shown that a 50\u202f% reduction of agricultural emissions could prevent the mortality attributable to air pollution by \u2009\u223c\u2009250\u2006000 people\u202fyr\u22121 worldwide, amounting to reductions of 30, 19, 8 and 3\u202f% over North America, Europe, East and South Asia, respectively.

International agreements to reduce the emission of acidifying sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds have been negotiated on the basis of an understanding of the link between acidification related changes in soil and surface water chemistry and terrestrial and aquatic biota. The quantification of this link is incorporated within the concept of critical loads. Critical loads are calculated using steady state models and give no indication of the time within which acidified ecosystems might be expected to recover. Dynamic models provide an opportunity to assess the timescale of recovery and can go further to provide outputs which can be used in future emission reduction strategies. In this respect, the Target Load Function (TLF) is proposed as a means of assessing the deposition load necessary to restore a damaged ecosystem to some pre-defined acceptable state by a certain time in the future. A target load represents the deposition of S and N in a defined year (implementation year) for which the critical limit is achieved in a defined time (target year). A TLF is constructed using an appropriate dynamic model to determine the value of a chemical criterion at a given point in time given a temporal pattern of S and N deposition loads.

The model includes emissions from various sources and atmospheric transport from the location of emissions to the location where the environmental effect occurs. Emissions can be reduced by several abatement options. The effects of these options, including side effects on emissions of various pollutants, are explicitly incorporated in the model.The model was used for an empirical analysis of interrelations in reducing ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector. In many countries, cost-effective ammonia abatement was found to result in an increase in nitrous oxide emissions. This was caused by measures that effectively reduce ammonia emissions but have adverse side effects on nitrous oxide, such as low ammonia application of manure and animal housing systems with low ammonia emissions. The results also indicated that several measures to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions, such as a lower nitrogen content in the fodder, improved fertiliser efficiency and feed additives improving animal productivity in milk and growth, simultaneously reduce ammonia emissions.Furthermore, the model was used to identify cost-effective emission reduction strategies to achieve geographically specific targets for nitrogen and sulphur deposition, contributing to acidification and eutrophication, combined with reduction targets for nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector, considering the interrelations in reducing emissions from the agricultural sector.

Methane emissions can be considerably reduced from underground coal mining, oil production, natural gas operations, landfilling of waste, and wastewater treatment. Also emissions from enteric fermentation and animal manure can be reduced substantially. The total technical potential for methane emission reduction (given the present activity level) is estimated to be about one third. The economic potential, having net negative emission reduction costs, is estimated to be about half of this value. These reductions can be attained over a period of 10 \u2013 20 years.

In order to understand the mechanism of emissions reduction, multidimensional computations were carried out for a heavy-duty diesel engine with multiple injections. Different injection schemes were considered, and the predicted cylinder pressure, heat release rate and soot and NOx emissions were compared with measured data. Excellent agreements between predictions and measurements were achieved after improvements in the models were made. The improvements include using a RNG k-e turbulence model, adopting a new wall heat transfer model and introducing the nozzle discharge coefficient to account for the contraction of fuel jet at the nozzle exit. The present computations confirm that split injection allows significant soot reduction with out a NOx penalty. Based on the computations, it is found that multiple injections have a similar NOx reduction mechanism as single injections with retarded injection timings. Regarding soot reduction, it is shown that reduced soot formation is due to the fact that the soot producing rich regions at the spray tip are not replenished when the injection is terminated and then restarted. With split injections, the subsequently injected fuel burns rapidly and does not contribute significantly to soot production. The present work also demonstrates the usefulness of multidimensional modeling of diesel combustion to reveal combustion mechanisms and to provide design insights for low emission engines. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH is in progress to reduce both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate (soot) emissions from diesel engines due to environmental concerns. One of the emission-control strategies is in-cylinder reduction of pollutant production. It is well known that it is very difficult to reduce both NOx and soot production simultaneously during the combustion process. Many emission-reduction technologies developed so far tend to increase soot emission while reducing NOx emission, and vice versa. For example, retarding fuel injection timing can be effective to reduce NO formation. However, this usually results in an increase of soot production. On the other hand, although increasing fuel injection pressure can decrease soot emissions, it can also cause higher NOx emissions at the same time [1]*. Recently, it has been shown experimentally that with high-pressure multiple injections, the soot-NOx trade-off curves of a diesel engine can be shifted closer to the origin than those with single-pulse injections, reducing both soot and NOx emissions significantly [2-4]. Nehmer and Reitz experimentally investigated the effect of double-pulse split injection on soot and NOx emissions using a single-cylinder Caterpillar heavy-duty diesel engine [2]. They varied the amount of fuel injected in the first injection pulse from 10 percent to 75 percent of the total amount of fuel and found that split injection affected the sootNOx trade-off. In general, their split-injection schemes reduced NOx with only a minimal increase in soot emissions and did not extend the combustion duration. Tow et al. [3] continued the study of Nehmer and Reitz [2] using the same engine, and included different dwells between injection pulses and triple injection schemes in their investigation. They found that at high engine load (75%), particulate could be reduced by a factor of three with no increase in NOx and only a 2.5% increase in BSFC compared to a single injection, using a double injection with a relatively long dwell between injections. They also found that triple injection could reduce NOx and soot emissions at both light and high loads. Another important conclusion of Tow et al. [3] is that the dwell between injection pulses is very important to control soot production and there exits an optimum dwell at a particular engine operating condition. The optimum dwell of a double-injection was found to be about 10 degree crank angles at 75% load and 1600 rev/min for their engine conditions. * Numbers in brackets designate References at the end of the paper. Pierpont et al. [4] confirmed that the amount of fuel injected in the first pulse affects the particulate (smoke) level in experiments where the NOx emission level was held constant. However, the best double injections were found to also depend on the spray nozzle included angle. For a production injector with a 125 included angle, which results in significant wall impingement on the piston bowl, the best double injections were found to be those with 50% to 60% of the fuel injected in the first pulse. They also found that with a combination of EGR and multiple injections, particulate and NOx were simultaneously reduced to as low as 0.07 and 2.2 g/bhp-hr, respectively, at 75% load and 1600 rev/min. Other multiple injection studies can be also found in the open literature [5, 6]. The published experimental works indicate that multiple-injection is an effective mean to control NO and particulate production during the diesel combustion process. In general, multiple injections allow the injection timing to be retarded to reduce NOx emission while holding the particulate at low levels. Both the amount of fuel injected in the first pulse and the dwell between pulses are important for an optimum injection scheme. With the application of multiple injection technology, the goal of improved injection scheme design and better control of engine combustion is made difficult by the fact that design variables are added with flexible injectors. It is thus helpful to simulate the engine processes with the use of computational models, which can provide detailed temporal and spatial information of precisely parameter-controlled injection and combustion processes. Patterson et al. [7] performed multidimensional computations of multiple injections using an improved KIVA code. They tried to reproduce the experimental results of Nehmer and Reitz [2] and achieved a fair success. However, the accuracy of their model prediction deteriorated for double-pulse injections as the amount of fuel injected in the second pulse increased. Kong, Han and Reitz [8] modified the code by including a modified RNG k-e turbulence model and turbulence boundary conditions [9]. Predictions of combustion and emissions of single-injections were shown to be improved significantly [8]. These successes motivated the application of the code to multiple injections in the present study. It is clear that a good model is necessary in order to predict engine combustion and emissions accurately. Accordingly, the submodels used by Kong, Han and Reitz [8] were implemented together with improved heat transfer and injection models. The models were first applied to the experimental results of the double injections of Nehmer and Reitz [2]. For better understanding of the formation of NO and soot during multiple-injection combustion processes, a set of designed singleand double-injection schemes were computed. Based on the computational results, a mechanism of emission reduction using multiple-injection is suggested.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "0538a755a4cd9d36387ae94a9b8fd7a63f1b854e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1589460610", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-01-3362", "CorpusId": 93744790}, "title": "Control Strategy for NOx - Emission Reduction with SCR", "abstract": "Future emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles like Euro 4, Euro 5, US '07 require advanced engine functionality.

The size of the reductions is currently the subject of international negotiations. This paper is intended to contribute to the analysis and assessment phase leading up to the adoption of new targets and timetables. However, we take a somewhat different approach than that suggested by the Berlin Mandate. Rather than focus exclusively on the next steps by developed countries, we view the issue from the perspective of the Convention's ultimate objective, the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations. We examine what might constitute cost\u2010effective strategies for limiting CO2 concentrations to alternative levels.
