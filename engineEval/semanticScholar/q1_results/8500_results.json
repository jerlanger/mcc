They then go on to discuss the theoretical merits of taxes versus quotas, concluding that theoretically a stable tax would best reflect the true social cost of emissions, which should not change with market conditions. They then go to evaluate the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where allowances for the emission of CO2 are traded (EUAs). The price signals offered by the scheme in its first trading period have been very unsatisfactory with high variability and the price trending down towards very low levels as it has become clear that governments were much too generous in their initial allocation of quotas. What is needed is a stable investment environment for low carbon generation investments. They discuss a number of policy options to achieve this: long period commitments on quotas; allowing unconstrained banking and borrowing of EUAs over multiple periods; long term price declarations to be used in allocation auctions; government issued contracts for differences on the future carbon price; or simply to issue low-carbon electricity contracts. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope for international agreements on carbon emissions reduction.

Emission projections until the year 2020 were prepared for: Status Quo scenario, Extended Emission Control scenario (EXEC) as well as for Maximum Feasible Technical Reduction scenario (MFTR). The general results were that Hg emission in Status Quo scenario, where no further action is taken to reduce mercury emission is predicted to rise between 2005 and 2020 for by-product sources, as a consequence of growing production of industrial goods and the consumption of raw materials, and is expected to be at the same level for the year 2020 for product use sources in comparison to the base year 2005, where no changes in consumption model were assumed. For EXEC and MFTR scenarios, assuming implementation of efficient control devices and changes in consumption model, decrease of mercury emission from by-product sources is expected between 2005 and 2020. Emission from mercury use in products for these scenarios is also predicted to decrease as a result of drop in mercury consumption.

These are not digested in the small intestine due to the natural absence of tissular \u03b1-galactosidase in mammals. The passage of these carbohydrates to the large intestine makes them available for fermentation by gas-producing bacteria leading to intestinal flatulence. The aim of the work reported here was to assess the ability of \u03b1-galactosidase-producing lactobacilli to improve the digestibility of \u03b1-galacto-oligosaccharides in situ.ResultsGnotobiotic rats were orally fed with soy milk and placed in respiratory chambers designed to monitor fermentative gas excretion. The validity of the animal model was first checked using gnotobiotic rats monoassociated with a Clostridium butyricum hydrogen (H2)-producing strain. Ingestion of native soy milk by these rats caused significant H2 emission while ingestion of \u03b1-galacto-oligosaccharide-free soy milk did not, thus validating the experimental system. When native soy milk was fermented using the \u03b1-galactosidase-producing Lactobacillus fermentum CRL722 strain, the resulting product failed to induce H2 emission in rats thus validating the bacterial model. When L. fermentum CRL722 was coadministered with native soy milk, a significant reduction (50 %, P = 0.019) in H2 emission was observed, showing that \u03b1-galactosidase from L. fermentum CRL722 remained active in situ, in the gastrointestinal tract of rats monoassociated with C. butyricum.

Controls on nitrate leaching from upland moorland catchments are not yet fully understood and yet, despite agreements on emission reductions, increased surface water nitrate concentrations may affect significantly the acidity status of these waters in the future.

Using downscaled monthly precipitation and temperature data output from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM), daily precipitation and temperature data were produced based on observed weather station data for the Tuttle Creek Lake watershed in Kansas and Nebraska. The A1B, A2, and B1 SRES emissions scenarios were compared to historical CCSM model output. Eight agricultural BMPs were physically represented within SWAT and compared across climate scenarios. Water yield, surface runoff, baseflow, sediment load, nitrogen load, and phosphorus load increased in all three future climate scenarios. Terraces, contour farming, and native grass were determined to be the most effective in pollution load reduction and percent efficiency at the field and watershed scales in future scenarios. Porous gully plugs and filter strips showed no significant changes in pollution load or percent reduction. Grazing management, no-tillage, conservation tillage, and grazing management percent and load reduction in future scenarios varied at the field and watershed scales.

At the seasonal scale, though an increase of summer precipitation and a reduction of winter precipitation were projected, both runoff and soil loss increased significantly for both periods. The dramatic increases in runoff and soil loss were attributed to the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events in the study area. Predicted soil loss from shrub communities increased more than that predicted for other plant communities under the three emission scenarios.

Chromospheric activity produces both photometric and spectroscopic variations that can be mistaken as planets. Large spots crossing the stellar disc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star. These spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles, and their perturbations alter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that might \u201ccontaminate\u201d the variations induced by a planet. Precise chromospheric activity measurements are needed to estimate the activity-induced noise that should be expected for a given star. \nAims. We obtain precise chromospheric activity measurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d \u2264 25 pc) cool (spectral types F to K) stars, to estimate their expected activity-related jitter. As a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationships between fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit a transformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e., Ca II H & K lines, to others that hold noteworthy advantages. \nMethods. We used high resolution (~50\u2009000) echelle optical spectra. Standard data reduction was performed using the IRAF ECHELLE package. To determine the chromospheric emission of the stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. We measured the equivalent widths of the chromospheric emission lines in the subtracted spectrum and transformed them into fluxes by applying empirical equivalent width and flux relationships. Rotational velocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. To infer activity-related radial velocity (RV) jitter, we used empirical relationships between this jitter and the R\u2019_HK index. \nResults. We measured chromospheric activity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, and projected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars.

In this process, the reduction stage is undertaken in a first reactor in which the framework oxygen of a reducible inorganic oxide is used, instead of the usual atmospheric oxygen, for the combustion of a carbonaceous compound, for instance, methane. The outlet gas from this reactor is mostly composed of CO2 and steam as reaction products and further separation of these two components can be carried out easily by simple condensation of steam. Then, the oxygen carrier found in a reduced state is transported to a second reactor in which carrier regeneration with air takes place at relatively low temperatures, consequently preventing the formation of thermal NOx. Afterward, the regenerated carrier is carried to the first reactor to reinitiate a new cycle and so on for a number of repetitive cycles, while the carrier is able to withstand the severe chemical and thermal stresses involved in every cycle. In this paper, the performance of titania-supported nickel oxides has been investigated in a fixed-bed reactor as oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion of methane. Samples with different nickel oxide contents were prepared by successive incipient wet impregnations, and their performance as oxygen carriers was investigated at 900 degrees C and atmospheric pressure in five-cycle fixed-bed reactor tests using pure methane and pure air for the respective reduction and regeneration stages. The evolution of the outlet gas composition in each stage was followed by gas chromatography, and the involved chemical, structural, and textural changes of the carrier in the reactor bed were studied by using different characterization techniques. From the study, it is deduced that the reactivity of these nickel-based oxygen carriers is in the two involved stages and almost independent of the nickel loading. However, in the reduction stage, carbon deposition, from the thermal decomposition of methane, and CO emissions, mainly derived from the partial reduction of titania as support acting as an additional oxygen source, may impose some constraints to the efficiency of the overall chemical-looping combustion process in CO2 capture.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "099a082352593014a210d53ba9c4684422a18801", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1604067614", "DOI": "10.1080/10789669.2011.578700", "CorpusId": 108735595}, "title": "Numerical comparison between energy and comfort performances of radiant heating and cooling systems versus air systems", "abstract": "A comparison between energy performance, simulated by means of the EnergyPlus building simulation program, of two air systems (all air and fan coil) and radiant heating and cooling floors/ceilings is developed in this work for various European climates (Milan, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Athens, Helsinki, and Moscow) and carried out on a reference building selected from among U.S. Department of Energy commercial building new construction benchmarks.

Because of its vicinity to biogenic and anthropogenic sources and sinks, the Schauinsland CO2 record shows considerably variability. In order to remove these disturbances and derive the large-scale representative \"background\" CO2 levels for the respective area (southwest Germany) we perform rigorous data selection based on wind speed and time of day. During the past 30 years, the selected CO2 mixing rations increased by 1.47 ppm per year, following the mean trend in midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The average seasonal cycle (peak-to-peak) amplitude has decreased slightly from 13.8+/-0.6 ppm in the first decade (1972-1981) to 12.8 +/- 0.7 ppm in the last two decades (1982-2001). This is opposite to other northern latitude sites and is attributed to the decrease of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the catchment area (southwest Germany and France) and its respective change in the seasonal variation. Except for May and June, monthly mean CO2 mixing ratios at Schauinsland are higher by up to 8ppm if compared to marine boundary layer air, mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in Europe. The CO2 measurements when combined with continuous 222Rn observations at the same site allow an estimate of the net CO2 flux in the catchment area of Schauinsland: mean seasonal fluxes compare very well with estimates from a process-oriented biosphere model (SIB-2) as well as from an inverse modelling approach (Peylin et al, 2000). Annual CO2 fluxes vary by more than a factor of 2, although atnthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 emissions show interannual variations of only about 10%. The major part of the variability must therefore be associated to interannual changes of biospheric uptake and release, which are on the order of the total fossil fuel emissions in the same area.

The results showed a strong decoupling during the period of 2010\u20132012, which is considered as the best development situation. In 1994\u20132010 SA had a weak decoupling; while during the period 1990\u20131994, the development in SA presented an expansive negative decoupling state. The comparison of the OECD and Tapio\u2019s methods showed well-correlated results but differed in their applications; however, the OECD method appeared as the simpler one. The results of Kaya identity demonstrated that the increase in population, GDP per capita and deteriorating energy efficiency were the main primary driving forces for the increase of CO2 emissions. It is suggested that SA can expand the share of renewable energy and promote green energy technology in addition to better strategies of the demand side management (DSM) to raise the efficiency of energy consumption as well as CO2 emission reductions.

Aliaga industrial region in Izmir, Turkey is one of the regions receiving POPs in the form of scrap iron and old ships to be scrapped. Ambient air samples were collected by passive sampling during four seasons in 2009 and 2010 (winter, spring, summer, and fall) at forty different sites in Aliaga to determine the spatial and seasonal variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Soil samples were also collected at the air sampling sites during the summer period. Phenanthrene was the most abundant PAH at all sites, and all samples were dominated by low to medium molecular weight PAHs, i.e., fluorene, fluoranthene and pyrene. The spatial distribution of ambient PAH concentrations indicated that the major PAH sources in the region were iron\u2013steel plants, petroleum refinery, and ship dismantling plants. At residential sites, PAH concentrations were higher in winter indicating that wintertime concentrations were mainly affected by residential heating emissions. However, highest atmospheric PCBs concentrations were observed in summer, probably due to increased volatilization from their sources at higher temperatures. Low to medium molecular weight PCBs (tri\u2013, tetra\u2013, penta\u2013CBs) were the most abundant compounds in air for all seasons.

A similar spatial variation was observed for soil PAH and PCB concentrations. Air and soil PAH and PCB concentrations were correlated significantly indicating the interaction of these compartments.

Different strategies for the restoration sector have been identified. However, there is not yet a common understanding of which policies could be the most efficient in reducing the global warming potential of the public restoration service. This paper assesses a set of procurement policies, ranking them according to their potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of public catering.MethodsEleven relevant green public procurement policies were identified from the literature. These are discussed in the context of a case study of the school catering service in the city of Turin (Italy). Initially, a life cycle approach is applied to a baseline scenario of the collective restoration system of the city, to quantify the quantity of greenhouse gases produced by the entire catering service (including all stages from the production of food to the management of waste from kitchens and canteens). Afterwards, the 11 policies were applied to the baseline scenario so that the potential improvement achieved by each policy could be quantified.Results and discussionThe baseline scenario resulted in 1.67\u00a0kgCO2eq per average meal. The production of food dominates the global warming potential of the full service, being responsible for about 78% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Among the selected policies, a change in diet was the most effective (leading to a 32% reduction of the CO2eq emissions), followed by the adoption of improved food production practices (11% reduction) and the purchasing of certified green electricity (6% reduction).ConclusionsThe proposed method allows the assessment of procurement policies in the catering service by applying a simplified life cycle approach that considers all the stages of the process.

High-resolution hydrogen microsensor profiles revealed pronounced differences in hydrogen accumulation among the species (from <1\u2009kPa to the saturation level). However, flux measurements indicated that the hydrogen pool was rapidly turned over in all termites, irrespective of the degree of accumulation. Microinjection of radiotracers into intact guts confirmed that reductive acetogenesis from CO2 dominated hydrogen consumption, whereas methanogenesis played only a minor role. Only negligible amounts of H2 were lost by emission, documenting an overall equilibrium between hydrogen production and consumption within the gut. Mathematical modeling revealed that production dominates in the gut lumen and consumption in the gut periphery for R. santonensis and Z. nevadensis, explaining the large accumulation of H2 in these termites, whereas the moderate hydrogen accumulation in C. secundus indicated a more balanced radial distribution of the two processes.

Nine ruminally cannulated lactating cows were used in a replicated 3\u00d73 Latin square design (32-d period) and fed (ad libitum) a TMR [forage:concentrate ratio of 60:40; dry matter (DM) basis], with the forage portion consisting of either alfalfa silage (0% CS; 56.4% AS in the TMR), a 50:50 mixture of both silages (50% CS; 28.2% AS and 28.2% CS in the TMR), or corn silage (100% CS; 56.4% CS in the TMR). Increasing the CS proportion (i.e., at the expense of AS) in the diet was achieved by decreasing the corn grain proportion and increasing that of soybean meal. Intake of DM and milk yield increased quadratically, whereas DM digestibility increased linearly as the proportion of CS increased in the diet. Increasing the dietary CS proportion resulted in changes (i.e., lower ruminal pH and acetate:propionate ratio, reduced fiber digestibility, decreased protozoa numbers, and lower milk fat and higher milk protein contents) typical of those observed when cows are fed high-starch diets. A quadratic response in daily CH4 emissions was observed in response to increasing the proportion of CS in the diet (440, 483, and 434 g/d for 0% CS, 50% CS, and 100% CS, respectively). Methane production adjusted for intake of DM, and gross or digestible energy was unaffected in cows fed the 50% CS diet, but decreased in cows fed the 100% CS diet (i.e., quadratic effect). Increasing the CS proportion in the diet at the expense of AS improved N utilization, as reflected by the decreases in ruminal NH3 concentration and manure N excretion, suggesting low potential NH3 and N2O emissions. Results from this study, suggest that total replacement of AS with CS in dairy cow diets offers a means of decreasing CH4 output and N losses. However, the reduction in fiber degradation and the resulting increase in volatile solids content of the manure may lead to increased CH4 emissions from manure storage.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "88f29518f75c2c6186916231f4f9e0e421b868d5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1795339875", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2015.09.006", "CorpusId": 108612755}, "title": "Resources saving and emissions reduction of the aluminum industry in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "9c7f6d59ed33ae422f79a7a1a9e240c58de2119f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2116742669", "DOI": "10.4271/2006-01-3474", "CorpusId": 15749842}, "title": "Fuel Economy Improvements and NOx Reduction By Reduction of Parasitic Losses: Effect of Engine Design", "abstract": "Reducing aerodynamic drag and tire rolling resistance in trucks using cooled EGR engines meeting EPA 2004 emissions standards has been observed to result in increases in fuel economy and decreases in NOx emissions.

Thus, in the 2005-07 period, ethanol was extremely profitable inducing substantial new investment.

SCL decisions traditionally have been based upon minimization of total logistics costs (inventory plus transportation). The paper aims to answer the following research question: given the environmental implications of vehicle emissions as a function of load weight, are the familiar SCL policies still optimal?Design/methodology/approach - Nonlinear expressions relating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to vehicle weight, and parameterized by trip length and average travel speed, were derived from published experimental data. Those expressions were included in a simulation model that assessed the environmental impact, in addition to the logistics cost, of the policies concerning when to release a consolidated load.Findings - For short holding times, the quantity policy performs best in terms of both logistics cost and pollution reduction. In the case of low-order arrival rates and long holding times, the time policy is best at reducing emissions and logistics costs. However, the best dispatch policy conflicts in terms of pollution reduction and logistics cost minimization for the following cases: moderate holding times and long holding times combined with high-order arrival rates. In these cases, it is necessary to consider the speed of travel, trip length and unit cost of emissions when evaluating the policies.Research limitations/implications - A carbon trading market appears to be on the horizon in several industries, which will establish a price per unit weight for CO2 emissions and make it beneficial to minimize the total cost (including emissions) of the network. This research only considers CO2 pollution, but future investigations could also consider other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic carbons.Practical implications - SCL policies can include a \u201cgreen logistics\u201d component that is based on empirical data. Originality/value - One undesirable consequence of transportation by truck is CO2 emissions. However, the impact can be lessened, while still emphasizing total logistics cost per load, with our simulation-based results for shipment release policies.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "a69448b3b6a4498d08fad4e9565d63e385fa1500", "externalIds": {"MAG": "46624435", "CorpusId": 127220115}, "title": "Potential Carbon Emissions Reductions from Concentrating Solar Power by 2030", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "34c96263d87cb01ef1eb33e9cf547ba9eccf025e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2139859994", "DOI": "10.1017/S004393391300007X", "CorpusId": 86021442}, "title": "Aspects of selection for feed efficiency in meat producing poultry", "abstract": "Over the last five years, the costs of poultry feed ingredients have increased substantially. This has been due to an increased use of corn for ethanol production and a greater overall global feed grain demand. Across the poultry industry this has led to higher production costs and reaffirmed the importance of feed efficiency on profitability. The effect that an increase in feed costs has on profitability is a clear driver for the selection for birds with better feed efficiency. Feed efficiency selection can be achieved using a number of different analytical methods. Selection for feed conversion ratio (FCR) has been used to improve feed efficiency with success but using a \u2018ratio\u2019 trait has mathematical limitations because selection pressure tends to be placed on the component traits of FCR in a non-linear manner. Another measure, residual feed intake (RFI) shows moderate to high heritability and does not have the mathematical limitations associated with FCR. RFI has little to no correlation with production traits and this indicates that genetic improvement of RFI within a selection index can be done without the confounding issues inherent with FCR. Improvements in RFI or FCR have a favourable effect on environmental emissions and decreases the environmental impact of poultry production. The current global production of ammonia, CH4, and N2O by the poultry industry is significant, at levels of 2.1, 29.44 and 279 million tonnes CO2eq, respectively. Reductions in emissions can be achieved via improvements in feed efficiency by lowering amounts of manure excreted and decreasing emitted by-products such as ammonia and greenhouse gases (N2O, CO2 and CH4). Consequently, improvements in feed efficiency can not only increase profitability of the poultry industries by lowering production costs but also decrease environmental impact by reducing environmental emissions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "fe68dab53da5b5d0af0d8cda717c0e8507b190ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1524248166", "CorpusId": 153305396}, "title": "Development and convergence : a bottom-up analysis for the differentiation of future commitments under the Climate Convention", "abstract": "A key issue in climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is how future commitments can be differentiated amongst countries. This thesis focuses on a more systematic differentiation of such commitments to support international decision making in this respect. Bottom-up information on reduction opportunities is taken into account, as well as the stabilization objective and most of the basic principles of the UNFCCC.\nThe thesis starts from the Triptych approach to the differentiation of commitments. This is a sector- and technology-oriented approach that takes into account various national circumstances to calculate emission targets. It played an important role in the differentiation of the European Union's Kyoto target over its Member States. The approach was upscaled to calculate emission targets at the global level and to identify characteristics of the approach that would need further consideration.\nOne of the outcomes of this exercise was the importance of valueladen choices and uncertainties in the approach. Therefore an assessment was made of the ranges in emission reduction targets that result from valueloading and uncertainty in input data and parameters. A modified version of Cultural Theory and Monte Carlo simulations were used as complementary methods to do so. An important finding was that notwithstanding valueloading and uncertainty the ranking of countries within the calculated differentiation of commitments remains roughly the same. This demonstrates that the Triptych approach is a robust tool for dealing with the issue of differentiation of commitments. \nA major factor affecting the resulting emission targets appeared to be growth assumptions for the energy-intensive industry. Therefore development trajectories of the energy-intensive industry in various regions of the world in the 1980s and 1990s were studied. On the basis of recent per capita growth rates in this sector, rough aggregate growth rates of industrial production per capita for the coming decades were projected: these were around 6% for the 'lower low' income countries, 3-4% for the upper low', 1% for the middle-income and 0.5% for the high-income countries. \nThe presumed rates of energy efficiency improvement turned out to be another factor influencing the outcome of the original Triptych approach. Therefore an assessment was made of international differences in energy efficiency in the energy-intensive industry. Data on energy efficiency were summarized in aggregated values for the Energy Efficiency Index in each world region. For some regions this aggregated EEI may be up to twice the current reference level (best practice), whereas for other regions this factor is not higher than 1.2. The concept of a technological convergence was suggested to estimate the effect of differences in energy efficiency on the differentiation of emission objectives. \nFinally an adjusted approach to the differentiation of commitments is presented, named the Global Triptych approach. The approach starts from three convergence trajectories in each of the energy-consuming sectors: convergence of energy efficiency in the energy-intensive industry, convergence of greenhouse gas intensity of electricity production and convergence of per capita emissions in the domestic sectors, which comprise the remainder of fossil fuel related emissions. For each of these variables global long-term sustainability targets for the year 2050 were defined based on bottom-up information on emission reduction opportunities. Calculated emission limitation objectives for the year 2020 compared to 1995 emissions ranged from \u009630% to more than 200% over all world regions. Meeting such objectives would seem to maintain the long-term possibility of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at about 550 ppm CO2-eq. It was concluded that within the approach various basic principles and the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC could be accommodated. These could be upheld in particular because bottom-up information on reduction opportunities had been incorporated.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "2aedee9ecf45a117a70f3564b90acda3668297c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3049415278", "DOI": "10.1039/d0ta07720h", "CorpusId": 224910500}, "title": "Enabling electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions by a CoP3 nanoneedle array", "abstract": "The Haber\u2013Bosch process for industrial-scale NH3 production suffers from hash reaction conditions and serious greenhouse gas emission.

There is, however, considerable genetic variability in plant responses to O3. To illustrate this, we show that ambient O3 concentrations in the eastern United States cause substantially different levels of damage to otherwise similar snap bean cultivars. Largely undesirable effects of O3 can also occur in seed and fruit chemistry as well as in forage nutritive value, with consequences for animal production. Ozone may alter herbicide efficacy and foster establishment of some invasive species.

Climate-induced drought events have a significant influence on sulphate export from forested catchments in central Ontario, subsequently delaying the recovery of surface waters from acidification. In the current study, a model chain that employed a statistical downscaling model, a hydrological model and two hydrochemical models was used to forecast the chemical recovery of Plastic Lake sub-catchment 1 (PC1) from acidification under proposed deposition reductions and the A2 emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Any predicted recovery in stream acid neutralising capacity and pH owing to deposition reductions were clearly offset by large acid effluxes from climate-induced drought events. By 2100, ANC is predicted to show large variations ranging between 10 and \u221230 \u03bcmolc L\u22121. Similarly, predicted pH in 2100 is lower (>0.05 of a pH unit) than the value simulated for 2000 (pH 4.35). Despite emission reductions, the future scenario paints a bleak picture of reacidification at PC1 to levels commensurate with those of the late 1970s. The principal process behind this reacidification is the oxidation of previously stored (reduced) sulphur compounds in wetlands during periods of low-flow (or drought), with subsequent efflux of sulphate upon re-wetting. Simulated catchment runoff under the A2 emissions scenario predictes increased intensity and frequency of low-flow events from approximately 2030 onwards. The Integrated Catchments model for Carbon indicated that stream DOC concentrations at PC1 will also increase under the future climate scenario, with temperature being the principal driver. Despite the predicted (significant) increase in DOC, pH is not predicted to further decline (beyond the climate-induced oxidation scenario), instead pH shows greater variability throughout the simulation. As echoed by many recent studies, hydrochemical models and model frameworks need to incorporate the drivers and mechanisms (at appropriate time-scales) that affect the key biogeochemical processes to reliably predict the impacts of climate change.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "baccaab4a5fa9f2beade4dcefeb620bce600ef1d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2907001356", "DOI": "10.1049/IET-GTD.2018.6502", "CorpusId": 115521527}, "title": "Optimal power dispatch considering load and renewable generation uncertainties in an AC\u2013DC hybrid microgrid", "abstract": "An AC-DC hybrid microgrid is gradually becoming popular.

The operational attributes of an AC-DC hybrid microgrid, and load and renewable generation uncertainties are incorporated in the optimal scheduling problem by using a customised power-flow technique, and by modelling uncertainties by Hong's two-point estimate method, respectively. The economic and environmental objectives are modelled in the fuzzy domain by fuzzy membership functions. A combination of particle swarm optimisation and fuzzy max-min technique is then employed for obtaining the optimal solution. The static active power droop constants of the dispatchable units are the control variables. Simulation results on a 6-bus AC-DC hybrid microgrid system demonstrate that optimal scheduling results in 4.26% reduction of operating cost and 13.91% reduction of emission in comparison to capacity based droop settings.

To design effective emissions control strategies there is therefore an urgent need for countries to elucidate the structural relationship between their domestic economy and emissions occurring through global supply chains.

However, there have been relatively few efforts in quantifying the emission factors (EFs) and for estimating the potential emission reduction benefits using emission control technologies for these vehicles. This study characterized the black carbon (BC) component of particulate matter and NOx, CO, and CO2 EFs of selected diesel-powered off-road mobile sources in Mexico under real-world operating conditions using on-board portable emissions measurements systems (PEMS). The vehicles sampled included two backhoes, one tractor, a crane, an excavator, two front loaders, two bulldozers, an air compressor, and a power generator used in the construction and agricultural activities. For a selected number of these vehicles the emissions were further characterized with wall-flow diesel particle filters (DPFs) and partial-flow DPFs (p-DPFs) installed. Fuel-based EFs presented less variability than time-based emission rates, particularly for the BC. Average baseline EFs in working conditions for BC, NOx, and CO ranged from 0.04 to 5.7, from 12.6 to 81.8, and from 7.9 to 285.7 g/kg-fuel, respectively, and a high dependency by operation mode and by vehicle type was observed. Measurement-base frequency distributions of EFs by operation mode are proposed as an alternative method for characterizing the variability of off-road vehicles emissions under real-world conditions. Mass-based reductions for black carbon EFs were substantially large (above 99%) when DPFs were installed and the vehicles were idling, and the reductions were moderate (in the 20\u201360% range) for p-DPFs in working operating conditions. The observed high variability in measured EFs also indicates the need for detailed vehicle operation data for accurately estimating emissions from off-road vehicles in emissions inventories. Implications: Measurements of off-road vehicles used in construction and agricultural activities in Mexico using on-board portable emissions measurements systems (PEMS) showed that these vehicles can be major sources of black carbon and NOX. Emission factors varied significantly under real-world operating conditions, suggesting the need for detailed vehicle operation data for accurately estimating emissions inventories.

In this review, the fuel injection pump and spray nozzle arrangement has been found to be the most critical components as far as the secondary atomization is concerned and further investigation of the effect of these components in the microexplosion of the emulsion is suggested to be center of focus.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "ea1af40891c75a768418f04e5a980e5c7f40d207", "externalIds": {"MAG": "140468894", "CorpusId": 126863630}, "title": "A comparative estimation of C.I. engine fuelled with methyl esters of punnai, neem and waste cooking oil.", "abstract": "In this experimental study, performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of methyl esters of Punnai, Neem, Waste Cooking Oil and their diesel blends in a C.I. engine was experimentally examined. For the study, Punnai oil methyl esters (POME), neem oil methyl esters (NOME), and Waste Cooking Oil Methyl Esters (WCOME) were prepared by tranesterification process. The Bio diesel-diesel blends were prepared by mixing 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of bio diesel with diesel. The effects of three methyl esters and their diesel blends on engine performance, combustion, and exhaust emissions were examined at different engine loads. Experimental results concluded that up to 30% of methyl esters did not affect the performance, combustion, and emissions characteristics. On the other hand, above B30 (30% Bio diesel with 70% diesel) a reduction in performance, combustion, and emission characteristics were clear from the study.

The model was developed as a minimum cost diet model. Two types of environmental policies were examined: a tax and a constraint on methane emissions. A tax was incorporated to simulate a greenhouse gas emissions tax policy, and prices of carbon credits in the current carbon markets were attributed to the methane production variable. Three independent runs were made, using carbon dioxide equivalent prices of $5, $17, and $250/t. A constraint was incorporated into the model to simulate the second type of environmental policy, reducing methane emissions by predetermined amounts. The linear programming formulation of this second alternative enabled the calculation of marginal costs of reducing methane emissions. Methane emission and manure production by dairy cows were calculated according to published equations, and nitrogen and mineral excretions were calculated by mass conservation laws. Results were compared with respect to the values generated by a base least-cost model. Current prices of the carbon credit market did not appear onerous enough to have a substantive incentive effect in reducing methane emissions and altering diet costs of our hypothetical dairy herd. However, when emissions of methane were assumed to be reduced by 5, 10, and 13.5% from the base model, total diet costs increased by 5, 19.1, and 48.5%, respectively. Either these increased costs would be passed onto the consumer or dairy producers would go out of business. Nitrogen and potassium excretions were increased by 16.5 and 16.7% with a 13.5% reduction in methane emissions from the base model. Imposing methane restrictions would further increase the demand for grains and other human-edible crops, which is not a progressive solution for an industry trying to be sustainable. However, these results might depend on the constraints and inputs used in our model (e.g., feed prices), and more extensive analyses are required before they are used in policy development. The model structure was able to incorporate effects of environmental policies in diet formulation and it can assist dairy producers in meeting limits set by these policies. The model can also assist policy makers examining the effects of policies on the dairy production system.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "97eb2ffa13dd350a3a73551cecd33a50af4d4ea2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2742872123", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TRD.2017.07.008", "CorpusId": 115813922}, "title": "Modeling the railway network design problem: A novel approach to considering carbon emissions reduction", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}]}
