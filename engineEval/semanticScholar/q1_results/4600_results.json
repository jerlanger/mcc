Since the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC in 2007, where the need for policy incentives for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) was first officially recognized, the focus of this debate has shifted to issues of implementation and methodology. One question is how REDD would be financed, which could be solved by integrating REDD credits into existing carbon markets. However, concern has been voiced regarding the effects that the availability of cheap REDD credits might have on energy investments and the development of clean technology. On the other hand, investors and producers are also worried that emissions trading schemes like the one installed in Europe might deter investment into new technologies and harm profits of existing plants due to fluctuations in the price of emissions permits. This paper seeks to contribute to this discussion by developing a real options model, where there is an option to invest in less carbon-intensive energy technology and an option to purchase credits on REDD, which you will exercise or not depending on the future evolution of CO2 prices. In this way, unresolved questions can still be addressed at a later stage, while producers and investors hold REDD options to maintain flexibility for later decisions. We find that investment in cleaner technology is not significantly affected if REDD options are priced as a derivative of CO2 permits. Indeed, the availability of REDD options helps to smooth out price fluctuations that might arise from permit trading and thus decreases risk for the producer - thereby being a complement to permit trading rather than an obstacle undermining cap-and-trade.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "06d2b09b8022b5962a64b5099bf257ca3de8fa3e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1843851661", "PubMedCentral": "4994379", "DOI": "10.1002/2014GB005008", "CorpusId": 12308775, "PubMed": "27610002"}, "title": "Disentangling the contribution of multiple land covers to fire\u2010mediated carbon emissions in Amazonia during the 2010 drought", "abstract": "In less than 15\u2009years, the Amazon region experienced three major droughts.

In this work, a mathematical model is developed to describe N2O dynamics during sulfide- and sulfur-based AD processes for the first time. The model is successfully calibrated and validated using N2O data from two independent experimental systems with sulfide or sulfur as electron donors for AD. The model satisfactorily describes nitrogen reductions, sulfide/sulfur oxidation, and N2O accumulation in both systems. Modeling results revealed substantial N2O accumulation due to the relatively low N2O reduction rate during both sulfide- and sulfur-based AD processes. Application of the model to simulate long-term operations of activated sludge systems performing sulfide- and sulfur-based AD processes indicates longer sludge retention time reduced N2O emission. For sulfide-based AD process, higher initial S/N ratio also decreased N2O emission but with a higher operational cost.

Contrary to prior studies, tropospheric mean OH in our ensemble shows little change at the LGM relative to the preindustrial era (0.5 \u00b1 12 %), despite large reductions in methane concentrations.

Key parameters controlling the tropospheric oxidative capacity over glacial\u2013interglacial periods include overhead stratospheric ozone, tropospheric water vapor, and lightning NOx emissions.

The experiment was conducted with naturally structured soil columns (silty clay, Vertisol) from a well aerated forest site.

Achieving persistence with a greater than 50% chance and right through to 2100 is possible only under both low climate change (RCP2.6) and semi-natural habitat restoration.

Dietary strategies can aid in the reduction of many airborne emissions, including dust and ammonia. Management techniques to quell, capture, or eliminate these air contaminants are numerous but vary in their cost, effectiveness, and practicality. Endotoxins, microorganisms, and nitrogenous compounds also can adhere to dust particles. Techniques for dust control include simple house cleaning, oil and water fogging, windbreaks, different filters, precipitation, certain housing systems and equipment, and vegetative shelterbelts. Many of the same strategies to reduce dust will also reduce ammonia losses as well. Simple procedures, including good manure management, reducing stress and maintaining bird health, reduce nitrogenous losses.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the contribution of the saturated zone to surface N2O emission for two fen soils and a Gleyic Luvisol with ground water tables at the surface during the experimental period. Total denitrification, denitrifier N2O production, ground water dissolved N2 and/or N2O, and surface N2O emissions were measured in situ. Concentrations of dissolved gases and surface emissions were also simulated with a simple process-based model assuming measured rates of N2and N2O production or constant profiles of dissolved N2O concentration. NO3\u2212 and N2O were abundant in all samples of the three sites. Substantial N2O surface emission originating from the saturated zone was measured at both fen sites. Total denitrification ranged from 0.9 to 1.58 mg N l\u22121 day\u22121 in the 15 \u2013 35-cm layer of the fen soils and from 0.005 to 0.13 mg N l\u22121 day\u22121 in the 50 \u2013 100-cm layer of the Gleyic Luvisol. The ratio of N2O production to total denitrification ranged from 0.07 to 0.32 in the fen soils and from 0.06 to 0.08 in the Gleyic Luvisol. The ratio of N2O production to total denitrification ranged from 0.07 to 0.32, and from 0.06 to 0.08, respectively. Concentrations of dissolved N2O measured at the fen sites were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than simulated concentrations. In contrast, measured N2O emissions were within the order of magnitude of emissions simulated assuming measured N2 and N2O production rates. The agreement between measured and simulated N2O concentrations and surface emissions was satisfactory when gas diffusivity was multiplied by 10 and N2O reduction rate was multiplied by 20 in the simulation. Simulation of diffusive N2O emission assuming constant values of measured N2O concentration profiles resulted in emissions approximately one order of magnitude lower than the measured values. At the Lake Creek site, the measured peak concentration of dissolved N2 and the concentration simulated assuming measured values of N2 production were relatively close with values of 2.4 and 3.5 times the atmospheric equilibrium concentration, respectively. It was concluded that the disagreements between measured and simulated values of N2O concentrations and emissions resulted from the underestimation of model parameters for gas transfer and/or for N2O reduction to N2,which were not measured.

Simulations are conducted for January and July 2001 to examine seasonal variation. Through the domestic O3 sensitivity investigation, we find O3 sensitivity varies dynamically depending on both time and location: North EA is VOC limited in January and NOx limited in July, except for the urban areas Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Seoul, which are VOC limited in both months; south EA is NOx limited in both January and July, except for the urban areas Taipei, which is VOC-limited in both months, and Pearl River Delta, which is VOC limited in January. Surface O3 change is found to be affected more by NOx than by VOC over EA in both January and July. We also find different O3 linearity characteristics among urban areas in EA: O3 at Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul shows a strong negative linear response to NOx emission in January; O3 at Shanghai, Pearl River Delta, and Taipei shows a strong positive response to VOC emission in both January and July. Through the long-range transport investigation, monthly O3 changes over EA resulting from different source regions indicate the largest source contribution comes from NA (0.23 ppb), followed by SA (0.11 ppb) and EU (0.10 ppb).

In this study, commercial Diesel fuel of Japan (JIS#2) was used as the test fuel. Cetane number of this fuel is 62. Some of previous research work shows that required injection timing for lean mixture formation to reduce NOx emission with high cetane number fuel was -90 deg.ATDC or more advanced point.

Here, the effects of stump harvest on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a former Norway spruce stand in mid Sweden are presented. CO2 exchange was continuously followed by eddy-covariance measurements during the first years after harvest. Differences in NEE from stump harvested and mounded (reference) plots were determined by soil-surface respiration measurements. Respiration from decaying stumps was estimated by a decomposition model. Fluxes indicated a direct effect (decreased efflux) during the first year after harvest that corresponded to the absence of decomposing stumps. During the following years, this emission reduction was increasingly counteracted by an indirect effect (increased efflux) of similar magnitude. This means that the expected emissions caused by extra soil disturbance occur with a certain delay and seem to increase with time. By these emissions, the substitution efficiency of stumps as bioenergy resource is reduced. Furthermore, at a time scale of centuries, instant combustion of stumps leads to a larger contribution to global warming than slow decomposition, because the stump carbon is available earlier in form of greenhouse gas.

Imaging research has markers in various stages of development for quantifying relevant information about each of these mechanisms, and those that measure tumor oxygenation and predict for radioresistance are the most advanced. Positron-emission tomography (PET) measurement of oxygen 15 has yielded important information, particularly about brain tissue perfusion, metabolism, and function. Indirect markers of tumor hypoxia have exploited the covalent binding of bioreductive intermediates of azomycin-containing compounds whose uptakes are inversely proportional to intracellular oxygen concentrations. Pilot clinical studies with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET detection of radiolabeled markers to tumor hypoxia have been reported. Recently, other studies have attempted to exploit the reduction properties of both technetium and copper chelates for the selective deposition of radioactive metals in hypoxic tissues. A growing number of potentially useful isotopes are now available for labeling several novel chemicals that could have the appropriate specificity and sensitivity.

Highest N2O emissions have been observed in organic forest soils with low pH. The mechanisms for these high emissions are not fully understood. Therefore, the present study was conducted to gain a deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms that drive high N2O emissions from acid soils. Specifically, we investigated the microbial community structure, by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, along a natural pH gradient in an organic forest soil combined with measurements of physico-chemical soil properties. These were then statistically related to site-specific estimates of annual N2O emissions along the same natural pH gradient. Our results indicate that acidic locations with high N2O emissions had a microbial community with an increased fungal dominance. This finding points to the importance of fungi for N2O emissions from acid soils. This may either be directly via fungal N2O production or indirectly via the effect of fungi on the N2O production by other microorganisms (nitrifiers and denitrifiers). The latter may be due to fungal mediated N mineralization, providing substrate for N2O production, or by creating favourable conditions for the bacterial denitrifier community. Therefore, we conclude that enhanced N2O emission from acid forest soil is related, in addition to the known inhibitory effect of low pH on bacterial N2O reduction, to a soil microbial community with increased fungal dominance.

The use of oxygenated fuels has been proposed as a means of complying with future emission levels. Previous research on oxygenates has suggested the presence of molecular oxygen within the fuel significantly reduces the formation of particulate matter (PM). The PM reduction is logarithmic and correlates with the weight percent of oxygen in the fuel and not with other properties such as chemical structure and volatility. However, many studies fail to correctly decouple the effects of oxygenates from other fuel properties that impact emission levels; such as cetane number, density, aromatic content, and volatility. Mechanisms responsible for changes in the combustion process and emissions were investigated with a matrix containing 14 fuels, addressing oxygenate proportionality, structure, volatility, equivalent structure without oxygen, and changes in the base diesel fuel. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to evaluate changes in particle size distributions, in addition to gravimetric filter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) measurements. Engine emissions tests were conducted using a Ricardo Hydra MK IV direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The sensitivity of engine operation parameters to intake temperature, load, injection timing, and ignition delay (ID) were evaluated with the baseline fuel. All fuels in the matrix were matched for total released energy and combustion phasing, using a cetane improving additive. The changes in emission have been quantified with agreement between the relative trends observed with the integrated SMPS volume concentrations and filter measurements. In order to evaluate changes among fuels and measurements taken with the SMPS, various fuels were subjected to physical and chemical characterization in order to determine morphological and compositional changes.

Indonesia, which has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation while doubling production of several major agricultural commodities, exemplifies this challenge. Here we focus on palm oil, the world\u2019s most abundant vegetable oil and a commodity that has contributed significantly to Indonesia\u2019s economy. Most oil palm expansion in the country has occurred at the expense of forests, resulting in significant GHG emissions. We examine the extent to which land management policies can resolve the apparently conflicting goals of oil palm expansion and GHG mitigation in Kalimantan, a major oil palm growing region of Indonesia. Using a logistic regression model to predict the locations of new oil palm between 2010 and 2020 we evaluate the impacts of six alternative policy scenarios on future emissions. We estimate net emissions of 128.4\u2013211.4 MtCO2 yr-1 under business as usual expansion of oil palm plantations. The impact of diverting new plantations to low carbon stock land depends on the design of the policy. We estimate that emissions can be reduced by 9-10% by extending the current moratorium on new concessions in primary forests and peat lands, 35% by limiting expansion on all peat and forestlands, 46% by limiting expansion to areas with moderate carbon stocks, and 55\u201360% by limiting expansion to areas with low carbon stocks. Our results suggest that these policies would reduce oil palm profits only moderately but would vary greatly in terms of cost-effectiveness of emissions reductions.

Recent studies showed that increasing the urinary concentration of the minor urine constituent hippuric acid resulted in reduced emissions of N2O from a sandy soil treated with synthetic bovine urine, due to a reduction in denitrification. A similar effect was seen when benzoic acid, a product of hippuric acid hydrolysis, was used. This current laboratory experiment aimed to investigate these effects using real cow urine for the first time. Increased concentrations of hippuric acid or benzoic acid in the urine led to reduction of N2O emissions by 65% (from 17% to <6% N applied), with no difference between the two acid treatments. Ammonia volatilization did not increase significantly with increased hippuric acid or benzoic acid concentrations in the urine applied. Therefore, there was a net reduction in gaseous N loss from the soil with higher urinary concentrations of both hippuric acid and benzoic acid.

The formation of 2-D gold nanowires was induced by the small amount of reducing agent because the preliminary gold nanoparticles formed by reduction of AuCl4- were thermodynamically unstable in the aqueous solution due to the insufficient capping of citrate. One of the key points of nanowire formation is the preferential adsorption of AuCl4- instead of citrate ions on the surface of the preliminary gold particles, which results in an attracting force between gold nanoparticles. We propose a hit-to-stick-to-fusion model, in which gold nanoparticles adhere by the attraction force and stick together, causing selective deposition of reduced gold metallic species on the concave surface of the two sticking particles, followed by fusion into nanowires. Nanowires then connect with each other, forming a network structure. The evidence obtained from TEM observation of transformation from gold nanowires on a TEM grid to large nanoparticles by hydrogen gas reduction and time-resolved measurements of gold ions suggest that gold ions not only are crucial for the growth of gold nanowires but also play an important role in stabilizing the shape of gold nanowires during the formation process.

The purpose of this phase 2a randomized placebo controlled multicentre positron emission tomography study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks treatment with AZD3241 on microglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson patients received either AZD3241 600 mg orally twice a day or placebo (in 3:1 ratio) for 8 weeks. The binding of (11)C-PBR28 to the microglia marker 18 kDa translocator protein, was examined using positron emission tomography at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks.

Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and / or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid \u201cobfuscation\u201d of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "846aa2a68d5c98fb279b033b7951f40757d07e6a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972433611", "DOI": "10.1021/EF7002393", "CorpusId": 94483534}, "title": "NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions Reduction Potential by Biodiesel Usage", "abstract": "The transport in many countries is the most significant source for NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Therefore, the possibility of reducing NOx and PM emissions is experimentally investigated using biodiesel and some of its blends with mineral diesel. Attention is focused on the optimal bus diesel engine adjustments for each tested fuel. The obtained engine characteristics are compared to each other by considering the 13 modes of the European stationary cycle test. The optimal injection pump timings are determined with the aim of reducing harmful emissions, while keeping other engine characteristics within acceptable limits. The optimal fuel blend is suggested, and the harmful emissions (NOx, PM, CO, unburned hydrocarbon, and smoke) reduction is estimated.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "95300da0f58531b0616faa12c69e6e55576501fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1523258424", "CorpusId": 94444436}, "title": "Semiconductor Photocatalysis: Principles and Applications", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION A Brief History of Photochemistry Catalysis, Photochemistry, Photocatalysis MOLECULAR PHOTOCHEMISTRY Absorption and Emission Intensity of Electronic Transitions Excited States Radiative Lifetimes Energy and Electron Transfer Proton Transfer and Hydrogen Abstraction Photosensitization Rates and Quantum Yields Quenching of Excited States Absorption, Emission, and Excitation Spectra Classification and Reactivity of Excited States MOLECULAR PHOTOCATALYSIS Hydrogenation of 1,3-Dienes Co-Cyclization of Alkynes with Nitriles Enantioselective Trifluoromethylation of Aldehydes Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis Reduction and Oxidation of Water PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY Electronic Structure and Nature of Excited States Photocorrosion Interfacial Electron Transfer SEMICONDUCTOR PHOTOCATALYSIS Mechanisms, Kinetics, Adsorption Characterization of Photocatalysts Preparation and Properties of Photocatalysts Type A Reactions Type B Reactions Environmental Aspects Titania in Food and Personal Care Products Photoreactors Index", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a5a2bd7e4745841708d4189f6282f042ba3370eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2045116035", "DOI": "10.1063/1.2400825", "CorpusId": 121407123}, "title": "Temperature dependence of the specific resistance in Ti\u2215Al\u2215Ni\u2215Au contacts on n-type GaN", "abstract": "The temperature dependence of the specific resistance \u03c1c in annealed Ti\u2215Al\u2215Ni\u2215Au contacts on n-type GaN was monitored, obtaining information on the current transport mechanisms. After annealing at 600\u00b0C, the contacts exhibited a rectifying behavior and became Ohmic only after high temperature processes (>700\u00b0C), with \u03c1c in the low 10\u22125\u03a9cm2 range. The results demonstrated that the current transport is ruled by two different mechanisms: thermoionic field emission occurs in the contacts annealed at 600\u00b0C, whereas field emission dominates after higher temperature annealing. The significant physical parameters related to the current transport, i.e., the Schottky barrier height and the carrier concentration under the contact, could be determined. In particular, a reduction of the Schottky barrier from 1.21eV after annealing at 600\u00b0Cto0.81eV at 800\u00b0C was determined, accompanied by a strong increase of the carrier concentration, i.e., from 2\u00d71018cm\u22123 in the as-prepared sample to 4.6\u00d71019cm\u22123 in the annealed conta...", "year": 2006}]}
