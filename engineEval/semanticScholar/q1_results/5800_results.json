A dynamic branch enclosure technique was implemented to determine the monoterpene emission rates of this evergreen oak species during the 2000 and 2001 campaigns. Major compounds emitted during both measurement periods were limonene, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, sabinene, and myrcene. In the 2000 field campaign the light- and temperature-dependent model of Guenther et al. [1993] did not fit the data due to drastic reductions of emission rates (and leaf gas exchange related parameters) observed at high air temperature and low air humidity (high water vapor pressure deficit). This plant physiological activity depletion and the subsequent emission reduction were attributed to severe water soil deficit conditions, as precipitation was very scarce during the growing season. In contrast, during the 2001 field campaign, neither emission nor physiological activity showed strong decreases in hot days. A good fit of experimental data to Guenther model was achieved in this field campaign (r2 = 0.90), and linear regression gave a standard emission factor (ES) of 14.0 \u03bcg gdw\u22121 h\u22121 (gdw is grams dry weight). Soil moisture was presumably higher than during the 2000 campaign due to recent rain events. With the purpose of documenting the drought stress effect at canopy level, monoterpene oak fluxes were measured by the modified Bowen ratio micrometeorological technique throughout the 2001 field campaign and in the late summer of 2002 and 2003. The measured emission by both techniques showed a reasonably good correlation, although micrometeorological fluxes were, in general, lower than upscaled branch emission rates. According to Guenther's parameterization, standard emission fluxes (FS) of 0.30 \u03bcg m\u22122 s\u22121 (r2 = 0.61) and 0.28 \u03bcg m\u22122 s\u22121 (r2 = 0.67) were derived for the 2001 and 2002 field campaigns, respectively. However, measured fluxes in September 2003 at high ambient temperature were much lower than those of the previous years.

The treatments of water management were (1) continuous flooding (CF), (2) flooding every when surface water level naturally declines to 15 cm below the soil surface (AWD), and (3) site-specific AWD with different criteria of soil drying (AWDS) established to find out the optimum for GHG emission reduction. Gas flux measurement was conducted by a static closed chamber method. Rice growth was generally normal and the grain yield did not significantly differ among the three treatments both in WS and DS. AWD and AWDS significantly reduced the total water use (irrigation + rainfall) as compared to CF. As expected, the seasonal total CH4 emission was significantly reduced by AWD and AWDS. On average, the CH4 emissions under AWD and AWDS were 35 and 38%, respectively, smaller than those under CF. It should be noted that AWD and AWDS were effective even in WS due partly to the field location on inland, upland area that facilitates the drainage. The seasonal total N2O emission did not significantly differ among the treatments. The results indicate that AWD is a promising option to reduce GHG emission, as well as water use without sacrificing rice productivity in this field.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "172abb9266e38fa1b9f8e007c33591c0d6a31d7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2065746825", "DOI": "10.1039/C3TC30933A", "CorpusId": 97565042}, "title": "Red, green and blue emissions coexistence in white-light-emitting Ca11(SiO4)4(BO3)2:Ce3+,Eu2+,Eu3+ phosphor", "abstract": "Ce3+, Eu2+ and Eu3+ singly activated and Ce3+/Eu2+/Eu3+-coactivated Ca11(SiO4)4(BO3)2 (CSB) phosphors were synthesized by novel and efficient aluminium reduction solid state reactions.

These phases include prompt and steady-state convection, the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the stages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission. Downdrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star \"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find that the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by extension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI motions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz after bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are practically independent of these speeds (and turnover timescales). Instead, they are set by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy frequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the characteristic GW frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure attributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details that determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate history, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport. During explosion, the high frequency signal wanes and is replaced by a strong low frequency, ~10s of Hz, signal that reveals the general morphology of the explosion (i.e., prolate, oblate, or spherical).

Aerosol particles were characterized by an Aerodyne aerosol chemical speciation monitor along with various collocated instruments in Beijing, China, to investigate the role of fireworks (FW) and secondary aerosol in particulate pollution during the Chinese Spring Festival of 2013. Three FW events, exerting significant and short-term impacts on fine particles (PM2.5), were observed on the days of Lunar New Year, Lunar Fifth Day, and Lantern Festival. The FW were shown to have a large impact on non-refractory potassium, chloride, sulfate, and organics in submicron aerosol (PM1), of which FW organics appeared to be emitted mainly in secondary, with its mass spectrum resembling that of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Pollution events (PEs) and clean periods (CPs) alternated routinely throughout the study. Secondary particulate matter (SPM = SOA + sulfate + nitrate + ammonium) dominated the total PM1 mass on average, accounting for 63\u201382% during nine PEs in this study. The elevated contributions of secondary species during PEs resulted in a higher mass extinction efficiency of PM1 (6.4 m2 g-1) than during CPs (4.4 m2 g-1). The Chinese Spring Festival also provides a unique opportunity to study the impact of reduced anthropogenic emissions on aerosol chemistry in the city. Primary species showed ubiquitous reductions during the holiday period with the largest reduction being in cooking organic aerosol (OA; 69%), in nitrogen monoxide (54%), and in coal combustion OA (28%). Secondary sulfate, however, remained only slightly changed, and the SOA and the total PM2.5 even slightly increased.

Methods: Annual average NO2 and PM10 were modelled using an emission-dispersion model. We assumed the meteorology and vehicle fleet remained constant during the pre- and post-CCS periods to isolate changes due to traffic flow. Air pollution concentrations were linked to small area socioeconomic, population and mortality data. Associated changes in life expectancy were predicted using life table analysis and exposure-response coefficients from the literature. Results: Before the introduction of the CCS, annual average NO2 was 39.9 \u03bcg/m3 and PM10 was 26.2 \u03bcg/m3 across Greater London. Concentrations were 54.7 \u03bcg/m3 for NO2 and 30.3 \u03bcg/m3 for PM10 among census wards within or adjacent to the charging zone.

The results indicate that ignition capability is significantly enhanced as flame development angle and combustion duration are reduced by upto 30 % compared to those with conventional spark plugs at certain operating points. Maximum possible dilution (limited by combustion stability index, Coefficient of Variation (COV) of Gross Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEPg)) with excess air and EGR were investigated experimentally at engine speed of 1500 rpm and 5, 12 and 18 bar IMEPg operating load and results indicate that the lean limit is extended by 0.8-1 Lambda unit and 5-8% EGR rate units. It was also observed that pre-chamber spark plugs cause charge pre-ignition at loads exceeding 10-12 bar IMEPg. To avoid this, the minimum amount of dilution, with excess air and then EGR, which is required to operate above 10 bar IMEPg was estimated experimentally. Finally, to compare performance and emission characteristics of operation with these two ignition techniques, the engine was tested on an ESC-like (European Stationary Cycle) 12 mode cycle. Results indicated marginal reduction in cycle averaged NOx emissions with maximum excess air dilution and about 50% reduction with maximum EGR dilution, whereas CO and HC emissions increased. Other operating characteristics like the flame development angle, combustion duration, brake efficiency etc. are also compared for the tested operating range of the test engine.

In this study, the LMDz-INCA climate-chemistry model and up-to-date global emission inventories are used to investigate the \"present\" (2000) and future (2050) impacts of transport emissions (road traffic, shipping and aircraft) on global tropospheric ozone. For the first time, both impacts of emissions and climate changes on transport-induced ozone are investigated. The 2000 transport emissions are shown to mainly affect ozone in the Northern Hemisphere, with a maximum increase of the tropospheric column of up to 5 DU, from the South-eastern US to Central Europe. The impact is dominated by road traffic in the middle and upper troposphere, North of 40\u00b0 S, and by shipping in the northern lower troposphere, over oceanic regions. A strong reduction of road emissions and a moderate (B1 scenario) to high (A1B scenario) increase of the ship and aircraft emissions are projected by the year 2050. As a consequence, LMDz-INCA simulations predict a drastic decrease in the impact of road emissions, whereas aviation would become the major transport perturbation on tropospheric ozone, even in the case of a very optimistic aircraft mitigation scenario. The A1B emission scenario leads to an increase of the impact of transport on zonal mean ozone concentrations in 2050 by up to +30% and +50%, in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. Despite a similar total amount of global NOx emissions by the various transport sectors compared to 2000, the overall impact on the tropospheric ozone column is increased everywhere in 2050, due to a sectoral shift in the emissions of the respective transport modes. On the opposite, the B1 mitigation scenario leads to a significant reduction (by roughly 50%) of the ozone perturbation throughout the troposphere compared to 2000. Considering climate change, and according to scenario A1B, a decrease of the O3 tropospheric burden is simulated by 2050 due to climate change (\u22121.2%), whereas an increase of ozone of up to 2% is calculated in the upper troposphere in the inter-tropical zone, due to enhanced lightning activity. A global impact of similar magnitude is simulated for the transport-induced ozone burden perturbation (\u22121.6%). As a result, the future increase in global ozone due to changes in anthropogenic emissions is lowered by 12% and by 4%, for the background and the transport-induced ozone, respectively. However, positive and negative climate effects are obtained on ozone, depending on the season, region and altitude, with an increase of the transport-induced ozone perturbation (+0.4 DU) in the already most affected area of Northern Hemisphere.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "9a3232e966aa4b112def86363bf0e14d692e73ce", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2995155698", "DOI": "10.1002/cssc.201902933", "CorpusId": 209434626, "PubMed": "31863564"}, "title": "Durable Cathodes and Electrolyzers for the Efficient Aqueous Electrochemical Reduction of CO2.", "abstract": "The world emits over 14 gigatons of CO2 in excess of what can be remediated by natural processes annually, contributing to rising atmospheric CO2 levels and increasing global temperatures.

At the same time emissions from shipping have continued to grow globally. Emissions from international shipping in sea areas surrounding Europe now contribute about 30% of the EU27 emissions of sulphur and NOx and affect ozone levels all over Europe. Although ozone levels are expected to decrease in most parts of Europe, prognoses for 2020 levels are still above what is considered as threshold values. A growing portion of these impacts can be attributed to emissions from international shipping. This paper presents an evaluation of the impacts on ozone levels in the European mainland due to emissions from international shipping. Calculations are carried out under recent (2004) conditions and for a scenario in 2020, where further emission reductions are applied to land based emissions while the ships emissions increase according to their expected growth in transport volumes, without additional technical reduction measures.

We investigate the effect of different shipping emission sources, in particular, international shipping inside the 12 mile zone from the coast, emissions from ships outside the 12 mile zone with EU flags and emissions from ships under other flags. It is shown that contributions from EU ships and non-EU and ships outside the 12 mile zone are about equal in magnitude.

Multiple laboratory and on-road exhaust measurements have been performed to estimate the NOx emission factors from various vehicles and their contribution to atmospheric pollution. Meanwhile, HONO emission from vehicle exhaust has been under-measured despite the fact that HONO can contribute up to 60% of the total hydroxyl budget during daytime and its formation pathway is not fully understood. A profound traffic-induced HONO to NOx ratio of 0.8%, established by Kurtenbach et al. since 2001, has been widely applied in various simulation studies and possibly linked to under-estimation of HONO mixing ratios and OH radical budget in the morning. The HONO/NOx ratios from direct traffic emission have become debatable when it lacks measurements for direct HONO emission from vehicles upon the fast-changing emission reduction technology. Several recent studies have reported updated values for this ratio. This study has reported the measurement of HONO and NOx emission as well as the estimation of exhaust-induced HONO/NOx ratios from gasoline and diesel vehicles using different chassis dynamometer tests under various real-world driving cycles. For the tested gasoline vehicle, which was equipped with three-way catalyst after-treatment device, HONO/NOx ratios ranged from 0 to 0.95 % with very low average HONO concentrations. For the tested diesel vehicle equipped with diesel particulate active reduction device, HONO/NOx ratios varied from 0.16 to 1.00 %. The HONO/NOx ratios in diesel exhaust were inversely proportional to the average speeds of the tested vehicles. Implications: Photolysis of HONO is a dominant source of morning OH radicals. Conventional traffic-induced HONO/NOx ratio of 0.8% has possibly linked to underestimation of the total HONO budget and consequently underestimation of OH radical budget. The recently reported HONO/NOx ratio of ~1.6% was used to stimulate HONO emission, which resulted in increased HONO concentrations during morning peak hours and its impact of 14% OH increment in the morning. However, the results were still lower than the measured concentrations.

This study proves the possibility to achieve high loads, up to 16 bar Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP), and ultra-low NOdx emissions, using turbo charging and dual fuel. Although the system shows great potential, it is obvious that the lack of inlet air pre heating is a drawback at low loads, where combustion efficiency suffers. At high loads, the low exhaust temperature provides little energy for turbocharging, thus causing pump losses higher than for a comparable diesel engine. Design of turbocharger therefore, is a key issue in order to achieve high loads in combination with high efficiency.

Improving rangeland management is a potentially significant source of mitigation from sequestration. It is appealing due to the likely links to sustainable agricultural development and poverty reduction. Many of the changes needed to sequester carbon are also associated with improved rangeland productivity and incomes. We provide an overview of the key issues that arise in determining the potential of carbon markets to support improved rangeland management focusing on West Africa, an area where pastoralism is a major economic activity with extensive rangelands that offer considerable potential for sequestering carbon. Estimates of the potential for increasing sequestration through improved rangeland management are summarized. Per hectare amounts are low, but aggregate potential is high. Carbon emission reductions are generated by reducing or avoiding land degradation, rehabilitating degraded lands, and increasing native carbon stocks by increasing aboveground and belowground biomass. Avoiding degradation and rehabilitating lightly degraded lands are the least costly and can generate significant carbon emission reductions. Carbon offsets from agricultural sources are currently limited under regulatory cap and trade regimes, and prices in voluntary markets are relatively low. Low returns to carbon offsets per hectare mean that significant co-benefits in the form of increased rangeland productivity and incomes would be necessary to induce participation. High transactions costs can be a problem in carbon markets and in adopting improved rangeland management practices, highlighting the need for institutions to provide effective coordination, monitoring, and enforcement.

In order to evaluate emission sources, to recognise environmental impacts at an early stage, and to take efficient legislative or technical measures, it is essential to know their behaviour in the anthroposphere as a function of time. So far, only very few investigations of this type exist for chemicals. In regular risk assessments, only rather limited knowledge is available concerning the behaviour of chemicals in the anthroposphere (production data, substance quantities in products, recycling rates, emissions occurring during use, etc.) or their lifecycle, and no information at all about their behaviour as a function of time. For this reason, it is these aspects that were investigated in a case study within the framework of the national research programme NRP50 for selected brominated flame retardants with endocrine-disrupting potential (pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromocyclododecane) or the potential to degrade to such substances (decabromodiphenyl ether).

Infection by E. alphitoides reduced net assimilation rate by 3.5-fold and isoprene emission rate by 2.4-fold, and increased stomatal conductance by 1.6-fold in leaves with the largest degree of infection of \u223c60%. These alterations in physiological activity were quantitatively associated with the fraction of leaf area infected. In addition, light saturation of net assimilation and isoprene emission was reached at lower light intensity in infected leaves, and infection also reduced the initial quantum yield of isoprene emission. Infection-induced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles and monoterpenes were light-dependent and scaled positively with the degree of infection.

As permafrost degrades under a warming climate, some of this carbon will decompose and be released to the atmosphere. This positive climate-carbon feedback will reduce the natural carbon sinks and thus lower anthropogenic CO2 emissions compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Simulations using an ensemble of the JULES-IMOGEN intermediate complexity climate model (including climate response and process uncertainty) and a stabilization target of 2 \u00b0C, show that including the permafrost carbon pool in the model increases the land carbon emissions at stabilization by between 0.09 and 0.19 Gt C year\u22121 (10th to 90th percentile). These emissions are only slightly reduced to between 0.08 and 0.16 Gt C year\u22121 (10th to 90th percentile) when considering 1.5 \u00b0C stabilization targets. This suggests that uncertainties caused by the differences in stabilization target are small compared with those associated with model parameterisation uncertainty. Inertia means that permafrost carbon loss may continue for many years after anthropogenic emissions have stabilized. Simulations suggest that between 225 and 345 Gt C (10th to 90th percentile) are in thawed permafrost and may eventually be released to the atmosphere for stabilization target of 2 \u00b0C.

Patients with a history of thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer present a unique model to investigate the cardiac effects of hypothyroidism. Ten patients without heart disease were investigated in the hypothyroid state and again 4-6 weeks later under euthyroid conditions. Myocardial oxidative metabolism was measured by positron emission tomography with [11C]acetate and the clearance constant k(mono). Cine magnetic resonance imaging was applied to determine left ventricular geometry. A stroke work index (SWI = stroke volume x systolic blood pressure/ventricular mass) was calculated. Then, to estimate myocardial efficiency, a work metabolic index [WMI = SWI x heart rate/k(mono)] was obtained. Compared to hormone replacement, systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular mass were significantly higher in hypothyroidism. Ejection fraction and SWI were significantly lower. Despite an additional reduction of k(mono), the WMI was significantly lower, too. In summary, cardiac oxygen consumption is reduced in hypothyroidism. This reduction is associated with increased peripheral resistance and reduced contractility. Estimates of cardiac work are more severely suppressed than those of oxidative metabolism, suggesting decreased efficiency.

We analyze CCS and renewable energy policies in a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model for settings of imperfect or missing carbon prices. We find that in contrast to renewable energy policies, CCS policies are not always capable of reducing emissions in the long run. If feasible, CCS policies can carry lower social costs compared to renewable energy policies, in particular when second-best policies are only employed temporally. In case fossil resources are abundant and renewable energy costs low, renewable energy policies perform better.

However, in addition, surprisingly, a marked two- to fourfold reduction in cerebral blood flow was observed throughout the affected hemisphere, well posterior and lateral to the intracerebral hematoma, including cerebral white matter and, to a lesser extent, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. In the one infant studied a second time, ie, at 3 months of age, the extent and severity of the decreased cerebral blood flows in the affected hemisphere were similar to those observed on the study during the neonatal period. At the three autopsies, the affected left hemisphere showed extensive infarction, corroborating the PET scans. These observations, the first demonstration of the use of PET in the determination of regional cerebral blood flow in the newborn, show marked impairments in regional cerebral blood flow in the hemisphere containing an apparently restricted intracerebral hematoma, indicating that the hemorrhagic intracerebral involvement is only a component of a much larger lesion, ischemic in basic nature, ie, an infarction. This large ischemic lesion explains the poor neurologic outcome in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage and hemorrhagic intracerebral involvement.", "year": 1983}, {"paperId": "712d4257fd846c26d2da389d91763ff96975c27e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980188690", "DOI": "10.1016/S0921-3449(97)00012-8", "CorpusId": 109267202}, "title": "Estimation of energy recovery and reduction of CO2 emissions in municipal solid waste power generation", "abstract": null, "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "9b25a4606501ff406cbbbca258433ea741b51b7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978955132", "DOI": "10.1006/ABBI.1997.0124", "CorpusId": 32463416, "PubMed": "9186488"}, "title": "Participation of reactive oxygen species in phototoxicity induced by quinolone antibacterial agents.", "abstract": "To elucidate the mechanism of phototoxicity induced as a side effect by some of the new quinolone antibiotics, we studied sparfloxacin (SPFX), lomefloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.

In this paper, we calculate the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions for three different system scenarios for this proposed ethanol production process, using process simulations and thermodynamic calculations. The energy required for ethanol separation increases rapidly for low initial concentrations of ethanol, and, unlike other biofuel systems, there is little waste biomass available to provide process heat and electricity to offset those energy requirements. The ethanol purification process is a major consumer of energy and a significant contributor to the carbon footprint. With a lead scenario based on a natural-gas-fueled combined heat and power system to provide process electricity and extra heat and conservative assumptions around the ethanol separation process, the net life cycle energy consumption, excluding photosynthesis, ranges from 0.55 MJ/MJ(EtOH) down to 0.20 MJ/ MJ(EtOH), and the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions range from 29.8 g CO\u2082e/MJ(EtOH) down to 12.3 g CO\u2082e/MJ(EtOH) for initial ethanol concentrations from 0.5 wt % to 5 wt %.

Compared to raw manure, CH4 emissions on a per-L basis were reduced 81% by SLS and 59% by AD, on average. The mean (SD) ultimate CH4 emission potential (B0) per kg of volatile solids (VS) was 247 (8) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for raw manure, 221 (9) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for separated liquid, and 160 (4) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for anaerobic digestate. Thus, SLS reduced the B0 of the liquid fraction by 11% and AD reduced B0 by up to 35% compared to raw manure.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are highly variable in time, with high peak emissions lasting a few days to several weeks and low background emissions. This temporal variability is poorly understood which hampers the simulation of daily N2O emissions. In structured soils, like clay and peat, aggregates hamper the diffusion of oxygen, which leads to anaerobic microsites in the soil, favourable for denitrification. Diffusion of N2O out of the aggregates is also hampered, which leads to delayed emissions and increased reduction of N2O to N2. In this model simulation study we investigate the effect of aggregates in soils on the N2O emissions. We present a parameterization to simulate the effects of aggregates on N2O production by denitrification and on N2O reduction. The parameterization is based on the mobile-immobile model concept. It was implemented in a field-scale hydrological-biogeochemical model combination. We compared the simulated fluxes with observed fluxes from a fertilized and drained peat soil under grass. The results of this study show that aggregates strongly affect the simulated N2O emissions: peak emissions are lower, whereas the background emissions are slightly higher. Including the effect of aggregates caused a 40% decrease in the simulated annual emissions relative to the simulations without accounting for the effects of aggregates. The new parameterization significantly improved the model performance regarding simulation of observed daily N2O fluxes; r2 and RMSE improved from 0.11 and 198 g N2O-N ha\u22121 d\u22121 to 0.41 and 40 g N2O-N ha\u22121 d\u22121, respectively. Our analyses of the model results show that aggregates have a larger impact on the reduction than on the production of N2O. Reduction of N2O is more sensitive to changes in the drivers than production of N2O and is in that sense the key to understanding N2O emissions from denitrification. The effects of changing environmental conditions on reduction of N2O relative to N2O production strongly depend on the NO3 content of the soil. More anaerobic conditions have hardly any effect on the ratio of production to reduction if NO3 is abundant, but will decrease this ratio if NO3 is limiting. In the first case the emissions will increase, whereas in the second case the emissions will decrease. This study suggests that the current knowledge of the hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes may be sufficient to understand the observed N2O fluxes from a fertilized clayey peatland.

The estimates indicate a decline in net emissions from 54 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 in1990 to 52 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 in 2008. Adoption of thesink-enhancing practices above the level projected for 2008 resulted in further declines in emissions to 48 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (L), 42 TgCO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (M) or 36 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (H). Among thesink-enhancing practices, the conversion from conventional tillage to ZT provided the largest C sequestration potential and net reduction in GHG emissions among the scenarios. Although rates of C sequestration were generally higher for conversion of cropland to PC and adoption of improved GM, those scenarios involved smaller areas of land and therefore less C sequestration. Also, increased areas of PC were associated with an increase in livestock numbers and CH4 and N2O emissions from enteric fermentation andmanure, which partially offset the carbon sink. The CEEMA estimates indicate that soil C sinks are a viable option for achieving the UNFCCC objective of protecting and enhancing GHG sinks and reservoirs as a means of reducing GHG emissions (UNFCCC, 1992).", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "cc476c4daef58a32899e3a1987e44b41909d9411", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2316139568", "DOI": "10.1021/am500040t", "CorpusId": 38338806, "PubMed": "24571718"}, "title": "Blue-emitting copper nanoclusters synthesized in the presence of lysozyme as candidates for cell labeling.", "abstract": "Highly fluorescent copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have been synthesized using single-step reduction of copper sulfate by hydrazine in the presence of lysozyme.

The results show that, unlike a carbon tax policy that prices all emissions reductions identically, the SGER program provides vastly different rewards for emissions reductions achieved in different ways within the same facility. Despite this, it is not accurate to say that the SGER systematically under prices emissions reductions relative to a carbon tax; in many cases the implicit incentives provided by the two policy options are identical, and in some cases the SGER would reward better performance where a carbon tax would not.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "51e1bc740f135095ec8549246a0d48663206f302", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1990671664", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-12-8323-2012", "CorpusId": 59519395}, "title": "On the observed response of ozone to NO x and VOC reactivity reductions in San Joaquin Valley California 1995\u2013present", "abstract": "Abstract. We describe the effects of nitrogen oxide (NO x ) and organic reactivity reductions on the frequency of high ozone days in California's San Joaquin Valley. We use sixteen years of observations of ozone, nitrogen oxides, and temperature at sites upwind, within, and downwind of three cities to assess the probability of exceeding the California 8-h average ozone standard of 70.4 ppb at each location. The comprehensive data records in the region and the steep decreases in emissions over the last decade are sufficient to constrain the relative import of NO x and organic reactivity reductions on the frequency of violations. We show that high ozone has a large component that is due to local production, as the probability of exceeding the state standard is lowest for each city at the upwind site, increases in the city center, is highest at downwind locations, and then decreases at the receptor city to the south. We see that reductions in organic reactivity have been very effective in the central and northern regions of the San Joaquin but less so in the southern portion of the Valley. We find evidence for two distinct categories of reactivity sources: one source that has decreased and dominates at moderate temperatures, and a second source that dominates at high temperatures, particularly in the southern San Joaquin, and has not changed over the last twelve years. We show that NO x reductions are already effective or are poised to become so in the southern and central Valley, where violations are most frequent, as conditions in these regions have or are transitioning to NO x -limited chemistry when temperatures are hottest and high ozone most probable.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "54b6115467d3b7da3eb743934b1de207081ed316", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2168942712", "DOI": "10.2516/OGST:2008033", "CorpusId": 55878211}, "title": "Glycerin for New Biodiesel Formulation", "abstract": "Biofuels are an important way of progress for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and finding new energetic resources. For diesel engines, FAE (Fatty Acid Ester), coming from transesterification of vegetable oils, have shown their potentials as fuel substitutes. Nevertheless, this transesterification induces the production of glycerin (or glycerol) as fatal co-product. Finding an outlet to this glycerol is fundamental for the FAE network. In the same time, oxygenated compounds have been shown to have great potential for the reduction of diesel particulate emissions. Transforming glycerol into new oxygenated compounds, which could be formulated with diesel fuel, would be a very promising way. Different oxygenates derived from glycerol, such as acetals, ethers and carbonates, have been synthesized and evaluated as blending components for Diesel fuel. Our objective was to evaluate their potential, compared with RME (Rapseed Methyl Ester) blends in term of pollutant emissions with different new engine technologies and to select the most promising of them. GTBE (Glycerol Ter Butyl Ether) was the most interesting compound and it was formulated with biodiesel with the respect of the physicochemical criteria required by EN14214 standard. This new biofuel (92.5% RME + 7.5% GTBE + 1000 ppm pro cetane) was incorporated in diesel fuel (5% vol.) and compared with a mixture containing 5% RME. After various tests carried out on vehicle and engine, focusing on pollutant emissions and possible fouling problems, it is possible to conclude that this new biodiesel does not present any technical disadvantage. The decision to use this glycerol derivatives in diesel fuel formulation will thus be controlled by economical criteria.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "9c30c06620563aad8d41e06f6071a0fa858d3c12", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/eor/YuZGY17", "MAG": "2568007340", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ejor.2016.12.023", "CorpusId": 25393057}, "title": "A multi-objective decision model for investment in energy savings and emission reductions in coal mining", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "6506a37d2e6462eb534a04eb64d33f9869f98edf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2787605616", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-18-2341-2018", "CorpusId": 54761669}, "title": "Decadal changes in summertime reactive oxidized nitrogen and surface ozone over the Southeast United States", "abstract": "Abstract. Widespread efforts to abate ozone (O3) smog have significantly reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) over the past 2\u00a0decades in the Southeast US, a place heavily influenced by both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. How reactive nitrogen speciation responds to the reduction in NOx emissions in this region remains to be elucidated. Here we exploit aircraft measurements from ICARTT (July\u2013August\u00a02004), SENEX (June\u2013July\u00a02013), and SEAC4RS (August\u2013September\u00a02013) and long-term ground measurement networks alongside a global chemistry\u2013climate model to examine decadal changes in summertime reactive oxidized nitrogen (RON) and ozone over the Southeast US. We show that our model can reproduce the mean vertical profiles of major RON species and the total (NOy) in both 2004 and 2013. Among the major RON species, nitric acid (HNO3) is dominant (\u223c\u200942\u201345\u202f%), followed by NOx (31\u202f%), total peroxy nitrates (\u03a3PNs; 14\u202f%), and total alkyl nitrates (\u03a3ANs; 9\u201312\u202f%) on a regional scale. We find that most RON species, including NOx, \u03a3PNs, and HNO3, decline proportionally with decreasing NOx emissions in this region, leading to a similar decline in NOy. This linear response might be in part due to the nearly constant summertime supply of biogenic VOC emissions in this region. Our model captures the observed relative change in RON and surface ozone from 2004 to 2013. Model sensitivity tests indicate that further reductions of NOx emissions will lead to a continued decline in surface ozone and less frequent high-ozone events.", "year": 2018}]}
