The overall uncertainty with respect to the following model input parameters is evaluated: anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, meteorological parameters such as wind speed and mixing layer height, actinic fluxes, quantum yields, and chemical rate coefficients. Airborne and ground-based ozone and nitrogen species, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and wind measurements from the Atmospheric Pollution Over the Paris Area (ESQUIF) campaign are used to construct an agreement function that assigns a larger weight to Monte Carlo simulations closer to observations.

We found that aerosol emission reductions associated with CO2 co-emissions had a significant warming effect during the first half of the century and that the near-term warming is dependent on the pace of aerosol emission reduction. The modeling results show that these aerosol emission reductions account for about 0.5 \u00b0C warming relative to 2015, on top of the 1 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels that were already reached in 2015.

Emissions from eight upper-canopy white oak (Quercus alba L.) leaves were measured periodically from the onset of isoprene emission on Day of Year (DOY) 119 (April 29) to leaf senescence in late October (DOY 299). Emissions from four leaves were measured under basal conditions with a controlled-environment cuvette system equipped with 10-ml gas-tight syringes and a reduction gas detector. Emissions from the other four leaves were measured under ambient conditions with the same system. Emission rates from the four leaves measured under ambient conditions were adjusted to basal conditions based on the PAR and leaf temperature algorithms of Guenther et al. (1993). The seasonal onset of isoprene emission was in agreement with previous studies where cumulative degree days from the date of the last spring frost were used to estimate bud break, leaf expansion, and increase in basal emission factor (EF). Between DOY 141 (May 21) and 240 (August 28), mean meteorological conditions 6 to 18 h prior to the EF measurements (ambient PAR and temperature) explained up to 78% of the variability in mean basal EF between measurement periods. Summertime mean isoprene emission potential was reached on DOY 141 (May 21) and was maintained until DOY 240 (August 28), when isoprene emission began to decline monotonically as leaf senescence approached. The mean value for leaves measured under ambient conditions and adjusted to basal conditions for DOY 141-240 was 75.6 &mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) (74.2-79.1), whereas the mean value for leaves measured under basal conditions was 72.9 &mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) (64.7-88.9).

In agreement with previous work at this and other sites, basal isoprene emission rates of fully exposed leaves at the crown apex of this tree were about 20% higher than those of the selected leaves. The length of the period prior to measurement of isoprene emission, during which meteorology was correlated with basal EF, appeared to be related to the timing and periodicity of meteorological change, and probably explains quantitative differences in the length of this period among studies. The empirical equation that we derived for this effect explained variability in midday EFs at the study site, but its general applicability remains to be tested.

Ambient pollutants and emissions in China have changed significantly in\nrecent years due to strict control strategies implemented by the government.\nIt is of great interest to evaluate the reduction of emissions and the air\nquality response using a data assimilation (DA) approach. In this study, we\nupdated the WRF-Chem/EnKF (Weather Research and Forecasting \u2013 WRF, model\ncoupled with the chemistry/ensemble Kalman filter \u2013 Chem/EnKF) system to directly\nanalyze SO2 emissions instead of using emission scaling factors, as in\nour previous study. Our purpose is to investigate whether the WRF-Chem/EnKF\nsystem is capable of detecting the emission deficiencies in the\nbottom-up emission inventory (2010-MEIC, Multi-resolution Emission\nInventory for China), dynamically updating the spatial\u2013temporal emission\nchanges (2010 to 2015/2016) and, most importantly, locating the \u201cnew\u201d\n(emerging) emission sources that are not considered in the a priori emission inventory. The 2010 January MEIC emission inventory was used as the a priori inventory (to generate background emission fields). The 2015 and 2016 January\nemissions were obtained by assimilating the hourly surface SO2\nconcentration observations for January 2015 and 2016. The SO2 emission\nchanges for northern, western, and southern China from 2010 to 2015 and from\n2015 to 2016 (for the month of January) from the EnSRF (ensemble square root\nfilter) approach were investigated, and the emission control strategies\nduring the corresponding period were discussed. The January 2010\u20132015\ndifferences showed inhomogeneous change patterns in different regions,\nincluding (1)\u00a0significant emission reductions in southern China; (2)\u00a0significant emission reductions in larger cities with a wide increase in the\nsurrounding suburban and rural regions in northern China, which may indicate\nmissing raw coal combustion for winter heating that was not taken into\naccount in the a priori emission inventory; and (3)\u00a0significantly large\nemission increases in western China due to the energy expansion strategy.\nThe January 2015\u20132016 differences showed wide emission reductions from 2015\nto 2016, indicating stricter control strategies having been fully executed\nnationwide. These derived emission changes coincided with the period of the\nenergy development national strategy in northwestern China and the\nregulations for the reduction of SO2 emissions, indicating that the\nupdated DA system was possibly capable of detecting emission deficiencies,\ndynamically updating the spatial\u2013temporal emission changes (2010 to\n2015/2016), and locating newly added sources. Forecast experiments using the a priori and updated emissions were conducted.\nComparisons showed improvements from using updated emissions. The\nimprovements in southern China were much larger than those in northern and\nwestern China.

The increase in NH3 and N2O emissions was significantly and negatively correlated with straw C/N ratio and soil clay content. Regarding the interactions between C sequestration and Nr losses, the increase in SOC content following straw return was significantly and positively correlated with the decrease in N leaching and runoff. However, at a global scale, straw return increased net Nr losses from both rice and upland fields due to a greater stimulation of NH3 emissions than the reduction in N leaching and runoff.

However, our current understanding seems to be limited on the relationships between the urban form and the GHG emissions, namely how the urban form affects the lifestyles and thus the GHGs on a much wider scale than traditionally assumed. The urban form affects housing types, commuting distances, availability of different goods and services, social contacts and emulation, and the alternatives for pastimes, meaning that lifestyles are actually situated instead of personal projects. As almost all consumption, be it services or products, involves GHG emissions, looking at the emissions from transport and housing may not be sufficient to define whether one form would be more desirable than another. In the paper we analyze the urban form?lifestyle relationships in Finland together with the resulting GHG implications, employing both monetary expenditure and time use data to portray lifestyles in different basic urban forms: metropolitan, urban, semi-urban and rural. The GHG implications are assessed with a life cycle assessment (LCA) method that takes into account the GHG emissions embedded in different goods and services. The paper depicts that, while the direct emissions from transportation and housing energy slightly decrease with higher density, the reductions can be easily overridden by sources of indirect emissions. We also highlight that the indirect emissions actually seem to have strong structural determinants, often undermined in studies concerning sustainable urban forms. Further, we introduce a concept of ?parallel consumption? to explain how the lifestyles especially in more urbanized areas lead to multiplication of consumption outside of the limits of time budget and the living environment.

Open pile burning in the vicinity of generation is frequently the only economic disposal option. A framework is developed to quantify air emissions reductions for projects that alternatively utilize bio-mass waste as fuel for energy production. A demonstration project was conducted involving the grinding and 97-km one-way transport of 6096 bone-dry metric tons (BDT) of mixed conifer forest slash in the Sierra Nevada foothills for use as fuel in a biomass power cogeneration facility. Compared with the traditional open pile burning method of disposal for the forest harvest slash, utilization of the slash for fuel reduced particulate matter (PM) emissions by 98% (6 kg PM/BDT biomass), nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 54% (1.6 kg NOx/BDT), nonmethane volatile organics (NMOCs) by 99% (4.7 kg NMOCs/BDT), carbon monoxide (CO) by 97% (58 kg CO/BDT), and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) by 17% (0.38 t CO2e/BDT).Emission contributions from biomass processing and transport operations are negligible. CO2e benefits are dependent on the emission characteristics of the displaced marginal electricity supply. Monetization of emissions reductions will assist with fuel sourcing activities and the conduct of biomass energy projects.

Anthropogenic carbon emissions are mostly generated from urban environments, where human activities are spatially concentrated. Improvements in uncertainty determinations and precision of measurement techniques are critical to permit accurate and precise tracking of emissions changes relative to the reduction targets. As part of the INFLUX project, we quantified carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ) emission rates for the city of Indianapolis by averaging results from nine aircraft-based mass balance experiments performed in November-December 2014. Our goal was to assess the achievable precision of the aircraft-based mass balance method through averaging, assuming constant CO 2 , CH 4 and CO emissions during a three-week field campaign in late fall. The averaging method leads to an emission rate of 14,600 mol/s for CO 2 , assumed to be largely fossil-derived for this period of the year, and 108 mol/s for CO. The relative standard error of the mean is 17% and 16%, for CO 2 and CO, respectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL), i.e. a more than 2-fold improvement from the previous estimate of ~40% for single-flight measurements for Indianapolis. For CH 4 , the averaged emission rate is 67 mol/s, while the standard error of the mean at 95% CL is large, i.e. \u00b160%. Given the results for CO 2 and CO for the same flight data, we conclude that this much larger scatter in the observed CH 4 emission rate is most likely due to variability of CH 4 emissions, suggesting that the assumption of constant daily emissions is not correct for CH 4 sources. This work shows that repeated measurements using aircraft-based mass balance methods can yield sufficient precision of the mean to inform emissions reduction efforts by detecting changes over time in urban emissions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "87287aeceee42f8916f9b8af128f51895a406a57", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2345657234", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1600298113", "CorpusId": 205278645, "PubMed": "27140643"}, "title": "Mode of action uncovered for the specific reduction of methane emissions from ruminants by the small molecule 3-nitrooxypropanol", "abstract": "Significance Methane emission from the ruminant livestock sector\u2014a by-product from enteric fermentation of plant biomass in the ruminant digestive system\u2014is produced by methanogenic archaea and represents not only a significant amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributing to climate change but also an energy loss and a reduction in feed efficacy. The present study elucidates the development and the unique mode of action of the highly specific inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), which is targeting the nickel enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase in rumen archaea that catalyzes the methane-forming reaction. At the very low effective concentrations recently applied in vivo (dairy and beef cattle), 3-NOP appears to inhibit only methanogens and thus to be attractive for development as a feed supplement. Ruminants, such as cows, sheep, and goats, predominantly ferment in their rumen plant material to acetate, propionate, butyrate, CO2, and methane. Whereas the short fatty acids are absorbed and metabolized by the animals, the greenhouse gas methane escapes via eructation and breathing of the animals into the atmosphere. Along with the methane, up to 12% of the gross energy content of the feedstock is lost. Therefore, our recent report has raised interest in 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), which when added to the feed of ruminants in milligram amounts persistently reduces enteric methane emissions from livestock without apparent negative side effects [Hristov AN, et al. (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(34):10663\u201310668]. We now show with the aid of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments that 3-NOP specifically targets methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR). The nickel enzyme, which is only active when its Ni ion is in the +1 oxidation state, catalyzes the methane-forming step in the rumen fermentation. Molecular docking suggested that 3-NOP preferably binds into the active site of MCR in a pose that places its reducible nitrate group in electron transfer distance to Ni(I). With purified MCR, we found that 3-NOP indeed inactivates MCR at micromolar concentrations by oxidation of its active site Ni(I). Concomitantly, the nitrate ester is reduced to nitrite, which also inactivates MCR at micromolar concentrations by oxidation of Ni(I). Using pure cultures, 3-NOP is demonstrated to inhibit growth of methanogenic archaea at concentrations that do not affect the growth of nonmethanogenic bacteria in the rumen.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d144c5ec7fc993718ce791e2061cde2bd62def54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2089048939", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-011-1982-5_38", "CorpusId": 96688049}, "title": "Forest Sector Carbon Offset Projects: Near-Term Opportunities to Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "The Framework Convention on Climate Change separately recognizes sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and provides incentives to establish C offset projects to help meet the goal of stabilizing emissions.

They are also potential sources of decentralized energy generation for rural electrification. Concerns on the long-term availability of petroleum diesel and the stringent environmental norms have mandated the search for a renewable alternative to diesel fuel to address these problems. Vegetable oils have been considered good alternatives to diesel in the past couple of years. However, there are many issues related to the use of vegetable oils in diesel engine. Jatropha curcas has been promoted in India as a sustainable substitute to diesel fuel. This study aims to develop a dual fuel engine test rig for evaluating the potential suitability of Jatropha oil as diesel fuel and for determining the performance and emission characteristics of an engine with Jatropha oil. The experimental results suggest that engine performance using Jatropha oil is slightly inferior to that of diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency of the engine was lower, while the brake-specific fuel consumption was higher with Jatropha oil compared with diesel fuel. The levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from Jatropha oil during the entire duration of the experiment were lower than those of diesel fuel. The reduction of NOx was found to be an important characteristic of Jatropha oil as NOx emission is the most harmful gaseous emission from engines; as such, its reduction is always the goal of engine researchers and makers. During the entire experiment, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the case of using Jatropha oil were higher than when diesel fuel was used. The higher density and viscosity of Jatropha oil causes lower thermal efficiency and higher brakespecific fuel consumption.

The low-altitude gas plume is typically blown westward by the prevailing wind across the Masaya caldera and Las Sierras highlands, which are at a higher elevation than the gas vent. In this study, the areal distribution of atmospheric SO2 concentrations was monitored within 44\u00a0km of the vent with a network of passive samplers. Measured SO2 air concentrations ranged from <2 to 90\u00a0ppbv in 1998 and from <2 to 230\u00a0ppbv in 1999. The data suggest that the volcanic emissions influenced air quality across a 1,250-km2 area downwind. Local topography exerts a strong control on plume dispersal, and hilltops are particularly prone to fumigation and thus, to high ambient SO2 levels. In a zone 22\u00a0km2 in size located within 15\u00a0km of the source, the response of vegetation to sustained exposure to high atmospheric dose of volcanic SO2 and HF resulted in a strong reduction in the number of plant communities. A transition zone of somewhat indefinite boundary surrounds the devastated zones and exhibits vegetation damage in the form of leaf injury. In addition to the environmental impacts of the volcanic emissions, both short- and long-term public health hazards may exist in areas most exposed to the plume. The harmful effects of the volcanic emissions on cultivated vegetation could be diminished by using windbreaks made of gas-tolerant trees and shrubs such as Eugenia jambos, Brosimum utile and Clusia rosea.

All the monomeric triads showed a blue-green emission in a dilute solution, which was assigned as an intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) emission. The intramolecular CT emission showed large Stokes shifts at a higher solvent polarity. The intramolecular CT emission further shifted to a longer wavelength with the increase in \u03c0-conjugation. Interestingly, a strong red emission was observed in highly concentrated solutions or in the solid state, which was assigned as an aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Moreover, the AIE strongly depended on solvent polarity. A large Stokes shift in AIE was attributed to the strong CT character. The changes in the dipole moment for the AIE state and monomer emission were evaluated using the Lippert-Mataga relationship. The density functional theory calculations showed that the change in electron distribution between the aryl amino group (highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO) and the carborane moiety (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) indicates the intramolecular CT character, and the emission colour changes were attributed to the HOMO-LUMO energy gap controlled by the \u03c0-extension of the phenylene linker.

FINAL REPORT", "abstract": "This study investigated five categories of transportation pricing measures - congestion pricing, parking charges, fuel tax increases, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) fees, and emissions fees. Advanced travel demand models were used to analyze these measures for the Los Angeles, Bay Area, San Diego, and Sacramento metropolitan areas. The analyses indicate that transportation pricing measures could effectively relieve congestion, lower pollutant emissions, reduce energy use, and raise revenues. For example, a combination of congestion pricing, employee parking charges, a 50 cent gas tax increase, and mileage and emissions fees would reduce VMT and trips by 5-7% and cut fuel use and emissions by 12-20%, varying by region. Because auto use and its impacts are quite inelastic to price, sizable increases in revenue can be obtained with relatively little effect on travel; conversely price increases must be large to obtain sizable reductions in travel and its externalities. Citizen reactions to prototype transportation pricing measures were explored in focus groups, and feedback from public officials and private organizations was obtained through meetings and interviews. First reactions were skeptical, but many were more favorably inclined after considering alternatives to pricing. Public acceptance would be increased by earmarking revenues for transportation improvements and providing independent oversight of revenue collection and expenditure. Federal and state laws govern and in some cases restrict the implementation of pricing strategies, and these and other institutional and administrative issues would have to be resolved before proceeding with specific measures.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "0f3cf9f7275cbb9b4d5d18dbe69fc6f5f9419e07", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2167039207", "DOI": "10.1021/es203750k", "CorpusId": 220757103, "PubMed": "22321206"}, "title": "Implications of the recent reductions in natural gas prices for emissions of CO2 from the US power sector.", "abstract": "CO(2) emissions from the US power sector decreased by 8.76% in 2009 relative to 2008 contributing to a decrease over this period of 6.59% in overall US emissions of greenhouse gases. An econometric model, tuned to data reported for regional generation of US electricity, is used to diagnose factors responsible for the 2009 decrease. More than half of the reduction is attributed to a shift from generation of power using coal to gas driven by a recent decrease in gas prices in response to the increase in production from shale. An important result of the model is that, when the cost differential for generation using gas rather than coal falls below 2-3 cents/kWh, less efficient coal fired plants are displaced by more efficient natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generation alternatives. Costs for generation using NGCC decreased by close to 4 cents/kWh in 2009 relative to 2008 ensuring that generation of electricity using gas was competitive with coal in 2009 in contrast to the situation in 2008 when gas prices were much higher.

Particles, climate change, and health have thought-provoking interactions. Air pollution is one of the largest environmental problems concerning human health. On the other hand, aerosol particles can have a cooling effect on climate and a reduction of those emissions may result in an increased temperature globally, which in turn may have negative health effects. The objective of this work was to investigate the \"total health effects\" of aerosol emissions, which include both exposure to particles and consequences for climate change initiated by particles. As a case study the \"total health effect\" from ship emissions was derived by subtracting the number of deaths caused by exposure with the estimated number of lives saved from the cooling effect of the emissions. The analysis showed that, with current level of scientific understanding, it could not be determined whether ship emissions are negative or positive for human health on a short time scale. This first attempt to approximate the combined effect of particle emissions on health shows that reductions of particulate air pollution will in some cases (black carbon) have win-win effects on health and climate, but sometimes also cause a shift from particle exposure-related health effects towards an increasing risk of health consequences from climate change. Thus, measures to reduce aerosol emissions have to be coupled with climate change mitigation actions to achieve a full health benefit on a global level.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "9a3b502bcdacd6f8dc4c015a77eda2d86aa59516", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1126/science.abg2371", "CorpusId": 235396282, "PubMed": "34112690"}, "title": "Nitrogen reduction to ammonia at high efficiency and rates based on a phosphonium proton shuttle", "abstract": "Shuttling protons in ammonia synthesis An electrochemical route to ammonia could substantially lower the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the current thermal Haber-Bosch process.

An important linkage is to improve the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands in these regions.Globally, we estimate potential agricultural CO2 mitigation through soil C sequestration to be 0.4-0.9 Pg C y-1, through better management of existing agricultural soils, restoration of degraded lands, permanent \"set-asides\" of surplus agricultural lands in temperate developed countries and restoration of 10-20% of former wetlands now being used for agriculture. However, soils have a finite capacity to store additional C and therefore any increases in C stocks following changes in management would be largely realized within 50-100 years.Mitigation potential through reducing direct agricultural emissions is modest, 0.01-0.05 Pg C y-1. However, the potential to offset fossil C consumption through the use of biofuels produced by agriculture is substantial, 0.5-1.6 Pg C y-1, mainly through the production of dedicated biofuel crops with a smaller contribution (0.2-0.3 Pg C y-1) from crop residues.Many agricultural mitigation options represent \"win-win\" situations, in that there are important side benefits, in addition to CO2 mitigation, that could be achieved, e.g. improved soil fertility with higher soil organic matter, protection of lands poorly suited for permanent agriculture, cost saving for fossil fuel inputs and diversification of agricultural production (e.g. biofuels). However, the needs for global food production and farmer/societal acceptability suggest that mitigation technologies should conform to: (I) the enhancement of agricultural production levels in parts of the world where food production and population demand are in delicate balance and (ii) the accrual of additional benefits to the farmer (e.g., reduced labor, reduced or more efficient use of inputs) and society at large.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "75f68a8c3b1c51fee6430f483e5f587aa6ee3791", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1912693401", "DOI": "10.1200/JCO.1999.17.4.1244", "CorpusId": 5940104, "PubMed": "10561185"}, "title": "Report of an international workshop to standardize response criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

To achieve this, two meetings were convened among United States and international lymphoma experts representing medical hematology/oncology, radiology, radiation oncology, and pathology to review currently used response definitions and to develop a uniform set of criteria for assessing response in clinical trials. The criteria that were developed include anatomic definitions of response, with normal lymph node size after treatment of 1.5 cm in the longest transverse diameter by computer-assisted tomography scan. A designation of complete response/unconfirmed was adopted to include patients with a greater than 75% reduction in tumor size after therapy but with a residual mass, to include patients-especially those with large-cell NHL-who may not have residual disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography gallium scans are encouraged as a valuable adjunct to assessment of patients with large-cell NHL, but such scans require appropriate expertise. Flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular studies are not currently included in response definitions. Response rates may be the most important objective in phase II trials where the activity of a new agent is important and may provide support for approval by regulatory agencies. However, the goals of most phase III trials are to identify therapies that will prolong the progression-free survival, if not the overall survival, of the treated patients.

Carbon footprint, as a concept of carbon emission measurement, can evaluate life cycle carbon emissions of production and service to meet final demand. It should include direct carbon emissions caused by fossil energy as well as indirect carbon emissions induced by intermediate products production. This paper aims to estimate carbon footprint of each province and inter-provincial transfer of carbon emissions in China based on an input-output approach and China IRIO 2002 database. The results indicate there are significant differences of carbon footprint and per capita carbon footprint among provinces in China. The provinces with higher carbon footprint, mainly located in northern China, have large economic scale. The provinces with high per capita carbon footprint include developed metropolitan regions and energy-rich regions with a high proportion of energy intensive sectors. Interregional transfer of carbon emissions has emerged from energy-rich regions with a high proportion of energy intensive sectors to developed coastal regions and developing regions with incomplete industrial systems. The results imply developed coastal regions should bear more obligation of carbon emission reduction. As a significant amount of carbon emissions of energy-rich regions with a high proportion of energy intensive sectors is induced by provision of energy intensive products for developed coastal regions and developing regions with incomplete industrial systems, interregional transfer of carbon emissions should be taken into account for regional obligation assignment of carbon emission reduction. It can be considered to reduce obligation of carbon emission reduction for those energy-rich regions with a high proportion of energy intensive sectors. Otherwise, a compensation mechanism should be considered for developed coastal provinces to provide financial and technological aid to energy-rich regions with a high proportion of energy intensive sectors for improvement of energy use efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "37e0b23bd0d101f660071290c94abc9a49d95bb1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1982496352", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJHYDENE.2006.09.029", "CorpusId": 59375187}, "title": "Greenhouse gas emissions reduction by use of wind and solar energies for hydrogen and electricity production: Economic factors", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "53f84187cf0ab85c28f0f3cc323905fc60f9b2b5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2299630552", "DOI": "10.1186/S13705-016-0070-3", "CorpusId": 43394310}, "title": "Bioenergy as climate change mitigation option within a 2\u00a0\u00b0C target\u2014uncertainties and temporal challenges of bioenergy systems", "abstract": "Bioenergy is given an important role in reaching national and international climate change targets.

Seh et al. review recent progress in electrocatalyst development to accelerate water-splitting, the reverse reactions that underlie fuel cells, and related oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide reductions. A unified theoretical framework highlights the need for catalyst design strategies that selectively stabilize distinct reaction intermediates relative to each other. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad4998 BACKGROUND With a rising global population, increasing energy demands, and impending climate change, major concerns have been raised over the security of our energy future. Developing sustainable, fossil-free pathways to produce fuels and chemicals of global importance could play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions while providing the feedstocks needed to make the products we use on a daily basis. One prospective goal is to develop electrochemical conversion processes that can convert molecules in the atmosphere (e.g., water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen) into higher-value products (e.g., hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia) by coupling to renewable energy. Electrocatalysts play a key role in these energy conversion technologies because they increase the rate, efficiency, and selectivity of the chemical transformations involved. Today\u2019s electrocatalysts, however, are inadequate. The grand challenge is to develop advanced electrocatalysts with the enhanced performance needed to enable widespread penetration of clean energy technologies. ADVANCES Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding several key electrochemical transformations, particularly those that involve water, hydrogen, and oxygen. The combination of theoretical and experimental studies working in concert has proven to be a successful strategy in this respect, yielding a framework to understand catalytic trends that can ultimately provide rational guidance toward the development of improved catalysts. Catalyst design strategies that aim to increase the number of active sites and/or increase the intrinsic activity of each active site have been successfully developed. The field of hydrogen evolution, for example, has seen important breakthroughs over the years in the development of highly active non\u2013precious metal catalysts in acid. Notable advancements have also been made in the design of oxygen reduction and evolution catalysts, although there remains substantial room for improvement. The combination of theory and experiment elucidates the remaining challenges in developing further improved catalysts, often involving scaling relations among reactive intermediates. This understanding serves as an initial platform to design strategies to circumvent technical obstacles, opening up opportunities and approaches to develop higher-performance electrocatalysts for a wide range of reactions. OUTLOOK A systematic framework of combining theory and experiment in electrocatalysis helps to uncover broader governing principles that can be used to understand a wide variety of electrochemical transformations. These principles can be applied to other emerging and promising clean energy reactions, including hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, among others. Although current paradigms for catalyst development have been helpful to date, a number of challenges need to be successfully addressed in order to achieve major breakthroughs. One important frontier, for example, is the development of both experimental and computational methods that can rapidly elucidate reaction mechanisms on broad classes of materials and in a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., pH, solvent, electrolyte). Such efforts would build on current frameworks for understanding catalysis to provide the deeper insights needed to fine-tune catalyst properties in an optimal manner. The long-term goal is to continue improving the activity and selectivity of these catalysts in order to realize the prospects of using renewable energy to provide the fuels and chemicals that we need for a sustainable energy future. Electrochemical energy conversion. Schematic showing electrochemical conversion of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen into value-added products (e.g., hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia), using energy from renewable sources. The combination of theoretical and experimental studies working in concert provides us with insight into these electrochemical transformations and guides the development of the high-performance electrocatalysts needed to enable these technologies. Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion, enabling a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. This review discusses design strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts and associated materials for several different electrochemical transformations involving water, hydrogen, and oxygen, using theory as a means to rationalize catalyst performance. By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed. We conclude by extending this framework to emerging clean energy reactions such as hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, where the development of improved catalysts could allow for the sustainable production of a broad range of fuels and chemicals.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "1675cca256f94fa57bcbdaffb7f84c692a9ad8a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2508178331", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2016.07.113", "CorpusId": 157387822}, "title": "Emissions reduction allocation and economic welfare estimation through interregional emissions trading in China: Evidence from efficiency and equity", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "22fc260a220dd5a49319ffa3e5492dd3c2a3fc4d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998856212", "PubMedCentral": "3189957", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0026176", "CorpusId": 8627194, "PubMed": "22028829"}, "title": "Measured and Simulated Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Ryegrass- and Ryegrass/White Clover-Based Grasslands in a Moist Temperate Climate", "abstract": "There is uncertainty about the potential reduction of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission when fertilizer nitrogen (FN) is partially or completely replaced by biological N fixation (BNF) in temperate grassland.

Three grazing treatments were: (i) ryegrass (Lolium perenne) grasslands receiving 226 kg FN ha\u22121 yr\u22121 (GG+FN), (ii) ryegrass/white clover (Trifolium repens) grasslands receiving 58 kg FN ha\u22121 yr\u22121 (GWC+FN) applied in spring, and (iii) ryegrass/white clover grasslands receiving no FN (GWC-FN). Two background treatments, un-grazed swards with ryegrass only (G\u2013B) or ryegrass/white clover (WC\u2013B), did not receive slurry or FN and the herbage was harvested by mowing.

Unlike trading schemes in other countries, the Tokyo ETS covers indirect emissions from the commercial sector. It is well known that a variety of market barriers impede full realization of energy efficiency opportunities, especially in the commercial sector. Experiences with the Tokyo ETS should therefore provide important lessons for the design of climate change mitigation policies, especially when targeting the commercial sector. The emissions from covered entities have been drastically reduced from those at the scheme\u2019s outset, with an average 14% reduction as of the end of the first commitment period of five years (2010\u20132014) compared with 2009 levels. This paper shows that the Tokyo ETS alone did not cause these reductions; there were other drivers. Among them, the energy savings triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 were crucial. The contribution of credit trading, in contrast, was limited since most of the covered entities reduced emissions by themselves. Through an investigation of official reports, an assessment of the emissions data from the covered entities compared to those of uncovered entities and in-depth interviews with firms covered by the scheme, this paper confirms that the main drivers of emissions reductions by covered entities were separate from the ETS. In fact, the advisory aspect of the scheme seems to be much more important in encouraging energy-saving actions. Key policy insights Most of the observed emission reductions were not caused by the Tokyo ETS alone. An advisory instrument was crucial to the effectiveness of the Tokyo ETS. The experience of the Tokyo ETS suggests that making full use of the advantages of emissions trading is difficult in the case of the commercial sector.

The prospect of federal action raises important questions regarding the interconnections between federal efforts and state-level climate policy developments. In the presence of federal policies, to what extent will state efforts be cost-effective? How does the co-existence of state- and federal-level policies affect the ability of state efforts to achieve emissions reductions? This paper addresses these questions. We find that state-level policy in the presence of a federal policy can be beneficial or problematic, depending on the nature of the overlap between the two systems, the relative stringency of the efforts, and the types of policy instruments engaged. When the federal policy sets limits on aggregate emissions quantities, or allows manufacturers or facilities to average performance across states, the emission reductions accomplished by a subset of U.S. states may reduce pressure on the constraints posed by the federal policy, thereby freeing facilities or manufacturers to increase emissions in other states. This leads to serious \u201cemissions leakage\u201d and a loss of cost-effectiveness at the national level. In contrast, when the federal policy sets prices for emissions or does not allow manufactures to average performance across states, these difficulties are usually avoided. Even in circumstances involving problematic interactions, there may be other attractions of state-level climate policy.

As production expands domestically and abroad, natural gas prices will be lower than without shale gas. Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption, and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal, nuclear, renewables, and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production, gasoline in transport, and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases, although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced. Modeling suggests that absent substantial policy changes, increased natural gas production slightly increases overall energy use, more substantially encourages fuel-switching, and that the combined effect slightly alters economy wide GHG emissions; whether the net effect is a slight decrease or increase depends on modeling assumptions including upstream methane emissions. Our main conclusions are that natural gas can help reduce GHG emissions, but in the absence of targeted climate policy measures, it will not substantially change the course of global GHG concentrations.

We compare the potential compensation received for these emission reductions to the cost of alternative upstream investments in forest monitoring capabilities. First, we find that upstream improvements can noticeably reduce the overall uncertainty in emission reductions. Furthermore, the costs of upstream investments in improved forest monitoring are relatively low compared to the potential benefits from carbon payments; they would allow the country to receive higher financial compensation from more certain emission reductions. When uncertainty is discounted downstream, we find that the degree of conservativeness applied downstream has a major influence on both overall creditable emission reductions and on incentives for upstream forest monitoring improvements.

Aircraft are attributed with emitting approximately 2% of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), and the total radiative forcing caused by aircraft emissions is a factor of two to four times greater than radiative forcing due to aircraft CO2 emissions alone [IPCC 1999]. Non-CO2 radiative forcing results primarily from emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and the formation of contrails and cirrus clouds. The magnitudes of climate impacts due to both of these phenomena depend strongly on cruise altitude. Additionally, aircraft fuel burn and NOx emissions rate depend on ight altitude. This study combines altitude variation of fuel consumption, emissions rate, and emissions eects to examine the relative climate impacts of dierent aircraft designs, as measured by the global mean temperature change resulting from 100 years of sustained aircraft operation. A simple time- and altitudevarying climate model is presented and integrated with an aircraft conceptual design code. Optimization studies are performed to compare economic and environmental performance of aircraft congurations. First, we optimize for a minimum-cost conguration, which is used as a reference for comparing performance of a variety of green designs. By optimizing an aircraft for minimum fuel burn or minimum NOx emissions, savings of up to 16% in fuel burn and 50% in NOx emissions are possible compared with a minimum-cost design. However, these aircraft achieve small reductions in global warming impacts of at most 7%. More signicant reductions in global warming impacts can be attained by designing aircraft to y at lower altitudes. A 30% reduction in global warming impacts can be reached by designing aircraft to cruise at about 28,000 ft and Mach 0.75, which increases operating costs by 1 to 2% relative to a minimum cost aircraft. A 50% reduction in global warming impacts can be achieved by aircraft designed to cruise at 25,000 ft and Mach 0.72, with a 1.5 to 3% increase in total operating costs. Up to a 75% reduction in global warming impacts can be attained by designing aircraft to cruise as low as 18,000 ft. Unfortunately, there is considerable uncertainty in estimating the global warming eects of NO x emissions and cloud formation. To address this, studies are performed to examine the sensitivity of results to variation in the magnitude of radiative forcing due to NOx emissions and cloud formation. Regardless of whether these forcings are much greater or less than current best estimates, there is still a potential net global warming impact savings of 20 to 55% possible by designing aircraft to cruise 10,000 ft lower and at a 12% lower Mach number than the minimum-cost conguration.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "530f4829f83a987b394ffccc2603d92aeaca50fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1534791607", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.336661", "CorpusId": 153252628}, "title": "Does Emissions Trading Encourage Innovation?", "abstract": "This article questions the conventional theory purporting to establish that emissions trading encourages innovation better than comparable traditional regulation. The conventional theory relies upon the incentive emissions trading creates for polluters to make additional reductions in order to sell credits. But emissions trading also creates incentives for half of the pollution sources (the credit buyers) to make less reductions than they would under a traditional regulation. By focusing analysis only upon the sellers of credits, the traditional theory systematically biases results. The induced innovation hypothesis - that innovation occurs in response to high costs - would suggest that emissions trading would tend to discourage innovation by lowering the cost of compliance through conventional techniques. Even innovation that costs a lot now can prove economically and environmentally superior over the long run, because innovation can make costs of new techniques fall over time and some innovations provide very wide ranging environmental benefits. But emissions trading encourages selection of the techniques with the cheapest current cost, not the cheapest long-term cost or the greatest long-term value.

This Academy study addresses the external social and environmental costs \u2013 the externalities \u2013 that accompany all electricity generating technologies. As reviewed here, these are costs not accounted for in the market price of electricity arising from impacts on, for example, climate, human health, crops, structures and biodiversity. Until identified, and then if possible quantified in monetary terms, they remain hidden, playing a limited role in technology selection. The main rationale for this study is that the Australian Government, like others in the industrialised world, has adopted climate change policies such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) for constraining carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions. Reduction targets call for a new portfolio of low-emission electricity generating technologies. The Academy believes that to meet these targets the focus must be on technology. Its recent study Energy Technology for Climate Change: Accelerating the Technology Response looked at technical, commercial and investment issues for various technology scenarios. Around $250 billion will be needed to bring the new technologies into production by 2050. There will also be heavy development costs. While the power generation technologies of the future will inevitably have lower external impacts relating to CO2 emissions, there will be other externalities. With adequate understanding of those externalities, policy and investment decisions relating to electricity generation can take into account all social costs and benefits.

In the debate on dealing with this threat, expectations are high that agriculture based economies of the developing world can help alleviate this problem. But, the contribution of agricultural operations to these emissions is fairly small. It is the clearing of native ecosystems for agricultural use in the tropics that is the largest non-fossil fuel source of CO2 input to the atmosphere.Our calculation show that the use of fossil energy and the concomitant emission of CO2 in the agricultural operational sector - i.e. the use of farm machinery, irrigation, fertilization and chemical pesticides - amounts to merely 3.9% of the commercial energy use in that part of the world. Of this, 70% is associated with the production and use of chemical fertilizers. In the absence of fertilizer use, the developing world would have converted even more land for cultivation, most of which is completely unsuitable for cultivation. Current expectations are that reforestation in these countries can sequester large quantities of carbon in order to mitigate excessive emissions elsewhere. But, any program that aims to set aside land for the purpose of sequestering carbon must do so without threatening food security in the region. The sole option to liberate the necessary land for carbon sequestration would be the intensification of agricultural production on some of the better lands by increased fertilizer inputs.As our calculations show, the sequestration of carbon far outweighs the emissions that are associated with the production of the extra fertilizer needed. Increasing the fertilizer use in the developing world (without China) by 20%, we calculated an overall net benefit in the carbon budget of between 80 and 206 Mt yr\u22121 dependent on the carbon sequestration rate assumed for the regrowing forest. In those regions, where current fertilizer use is low, the relative benefits are the highest as responding yield increases are highest and thus more land can be set aside without harming food security. In Sub-Saharan Africa a 20% fertilizer increase, which amounts to 0.14 Mt of extra fertilizer, can tie up somewhere between 8 and 19 Mt of CO2 per year (average: 96 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In the Near East and North Africa with a 20%-increased fertilizer use of 0.4 Mt yr-1 between 10 and 24 Mt of CO2 could be sequestered on the land set aside (40 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer). In South Asia this is 22\u201361 Mt CO2 yr\u22121 with an annual additional input of 2.15 Mt fertilizer (19 t CO2 per 1 t fertilizer).In fact, carbon credits may be the only way for some of the farmers in these regions to afford the costly inputs. Additionally, in regions with already relatively high fertilizer inputs such as in South Asia, an efficient use of the extra fertilizer must be warranted.Nevertheless, the net CO2 benefit through implementation of this measure in the developing world is insignificant compared to the worldwide CO2 output by human activity. Thus, reforestation is only one mitigating measure and not the solution to unconstrained fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Carbon emissions should, therefore, first of all be reduced by the avoidance of deforestation in the developing world and moreover by higher energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "02de8107107774265ecf7eae9fcd70b40d5540c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152489773", "DOI": "10.1006/JEEM.1999.1112", "CorpusId": 154399452}, "title": "Allocation of CO2 Emissions Permits: A General Equilibrium Analysis of Policy Instruments", "abstract": "What are the effects of different ways of allocating CO2 emissions permits under a tradable permit scheme?

Extended, diffuse X-ray emission is detected in all but two of the objects. Unresolved sources were found within all dwarf galaxies (total: 55 sources).

However, we have previously shown that some regions in which irreversible defects persist despite reinjection are metabolically active, and hence viable, by positron emission tomography. In the current study, we determined whether the severity of reduction in thallium activity within irreversible defects on redistribution images and the magnitude of change in regional thallium activity after reinjection can further discriminate viable from nonviable myocardium in such defects.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe studied 150 patients with coronary artery disease by exercise thallium tomography using the rest-reinjection protocol. The three sets of images (stress, redistribution, and reinjection) were then analyzed quantitatively. The increase in regional thallium activity from redistribution to reinjection was computed, normalized to the increase observed in a normal region, and termed \"differential uptake.\" Of the 175 myocardial regions designated to have irreversible thallium defects on conventional 3-4 hour redistribution images, 132 had only mild-to-moderate reduction in thallium activity (51-85% of normal activity), and 43 had severe reduction in thallium activity (less than or equal to 50% of normal activity). Thallium reinjection resulted in enhanced relative activity in 60 of 132 (45%) of the mild-to-moderate irreversible defects and 22 of 43 (51%) of the severe irreversible defects, leaving roughly half of these defects remaining irreversible after reinjection. However, in regions that appeared to remain irreversible despite reinjection, the magnitude of differential uptake differed between mild-to-moderate (74 +/- 14%) and severe (35 +/- 16%) irreversible defects (p less than 0.001). All regions with mild-to-moderate defects demonstrated greater than 50% differential uptake after reinjection. In contrast, all except two of the regions with severe irreversible defects demonstrated differential uptake of less than 50%. Fifteen patients also underwent positron emission tomography at rest with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 15O-water. FDG uptake was present in 91% of regions with mild-to-moderate reduction in thallium activity, and the results of differential uptake and FDG data were concordant in 81% of these regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate that the magnitude of thallium uptake after reinjection differs between mild-to-moderate and severe irreversible defects on standard 3-4 hour redistribution images. The substantial differential uptake of thallium (greater than 50%) after reinjection in mild-to-moderate defects, even when relative thallium activity does not increase appreciably (and the defect appears to remain irreversible), coupled with preserved metabolic activity by positron emission tomography, supports the concept that such mild-to-moderate irreversible defects represent viable myocardium.", "year": 1992}, {"paperId": "e70de7a1602b048ce6812c4ee52d40b8eb0c41fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023568111", "DOI": "10.1021/ES000143L", "CorpusId": 22668103, "PubMed": "11347909"}, "title": "Emission of nonchlorinated and chlorinated aromatics in the flue gas of incineration plants during and after transient disturbances of combustion conditions: delayed emission effects.", "abstract": "The profiles of different products of incomplete combustion (PIC) in the flue gas of a 1 MW pilot combustion facility were investigated under normal steady-state and disturbed combustion conditions. The behavior of emission profiles after disturbed combustion conditions was investigated in order to obtain a better understanding of emission memory effects. Highly time-resolved, quantitative on-line measurements of several aromatic species down to low ppbv or higher pptv concentrations were performed by a mobile resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Conventional analytical methods (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography) were also applied for measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/F). The sampling point was located in the high-temperature region of the plant at the outlet of the post-combustion chamber at temperatures between 650 and 880 degrees C, prior to any emission reduction devices. The investigation pointed out that after a short phase of disturbed combustion conditions, e.g., due to process changes, transient puffs, or malfunctions, the composition of combustion byproducts in the flue gas can be changed drastically for a very long time (\"memory emission\" effect). It is suggested that carbonaceous layers, deposited on the inner walls in the high-temperature zone of the plant, might be responsible for the observed memory emission of some PAH species. Drastic changes in the profiles of the PCDD/F homologues were also observed during memory emission conditions. The PAH memory most likely is due to pyrolytic degradation of the carbonaceous layers, while the altered PCDD/F homologue pattern may be mediated by the high catalytic activity of the freshly formed deposit layers. Finally, it should be emphasized that a rich pattern of aromatic species, including PCDD/F, was found in a temperature regime well above the typical temperature window (approximately 300 degrees C) for de novo PCDD/F formation.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "c188aa85c9cf6ee2eb159f6919d3affac060fb04", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2062892584", "DOI": "10.1071/CH04130", "CorpusId": 97513024}, "title": "Spectroscopy of Naphthalene Diimides and Their Anion Radicals", "abstract": "Naphthalene diimides 1\u20134 having different N,N-disubstitution undergo single electron reduction processes either chemically or electrochemically to yield the corresponding radical anion in high yield.

Compound 1 exhibits mirror image absorption and fluorescence in the near-UV region in CH2Cl2 and dimethylformamide that is typical of monomeric N,N-dialkyl-substituted naphthalene diimides.

Bulk one-electron reduction of 1\u20134 is characterized by dramatic changes in the absorption and emission spectra. Additionally, highly structured EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) signals from dimethylformamide solutions of the radical anions of 1\u20133 have been obtained and are consistent with coupling between the unpaired electron and the naphthalene diimide nitrogens and hydrogens and the NCH hydrogens of the appropriate side chains.

Contrarily to concerns raised by environmentalists, an emission-decomposition exercise shows that scale effects are dominated by technique effects working towards a reduction in emissions. A second exercise comparing the actual trade situation with an autarky benchmark estimates that trade, by allowing clean countries to become net importers of emissions, leads to a 10% increase in world emissions with respect to autarky in 1990, a figure that shrinks to 3.5% in 2000. Additionally, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that emissions related to transport are of smaller magnitude, roughly 3% in both periods. In a third exercise, we use linear programming to simulate extreme situations where world emissions are either maximal or minimal. It turns out that effective emissions correspond to a 90% reduction with respect to the worst case, but that another 80% reduction could be reached if emissions were minimal.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "6b276225026544ddbd517df5fe6de57b31795683", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2336998050", "DOI": "10.1080/23311916.2016.1167990", "CorpusId": 167857359}, "title": "A review of renewable energy sources, sustainability issues and climate change mitigation", "abstract": "Abstract The world is fast becoming a global village due to the increasing daily requirement of energy by all population across the world while the earth in its form cannot change. The need for energy and its related services to satisfy human social and economic development, welfare and health is increasing. Returning to renewables to help mitigate climate change is an excellent approach which needs to be sustainable in order to meet energy demand of future generations. The study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes: Energy Security, Energy Access, Social and Economic development, Climate Change Mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts. Despite these opportunities, there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation. These challenges include Market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and our daily carbon footprint. The study suggested some measures and policy recommendations which when considered would help achieve the goal of renewable energy thus to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and provide a clean environment as well as clean energy for all and future generations.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d91c1d4beca379c51d6944af4a85c9fe62d22731", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2810559946", "DOI": "10.1038/s41612-018-0037-5", "CorpusId": 135099250}, "title": "Vehicle criteria pollutant (PM, NOx, CO, HCs) emissions: how low should we go?", "abstract": "Over the past 30\u201340 years, vehicle tailpipe emissions of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HCs) have decreased significantly. Advanced emission after-treatment technologies have been developed for gasoline and diesel vehicles to meet increasingly stringent regulations, yielding absolute emission reductions from the fleet despite increased vehicle travel. As a result of mobile and stationary source emission controls, air quality has generally improved substantially in cities across the US and Europe. Emission regulations (such as Tier 3 in the US, LEV III in California, and Euro 6 rules in the EU) will lead to even lower vehicle emissions and further improvements in air quality. We review historical vehicle emission and air quality trends, discuss the future outlook for air quality, and note that modern internal combustion engine vehicles typically have lower exhaust emissions than battery electric vehicle upstream emissions. As vehicle manufacturers and city officials grapple with questions about future mobility in cities, we raise the question \u201chow low should we go?\u201d for future vehicle criteria emissions.

In fact, the increasing attention to renewable resources is driven by the climate change due to GHG emissions caused by the widespread utilization of conventional fossil fuels, while biomass gasification is considered as a potentially sustainable and environmentally-friendly technology.
