As outsourcing has risen, developed countries have been able to decarbonize domestically, at the expense of increased emissions in developing countries. However, the rapid improvement of carbon efficiency in developing regions together with the post-2008 deceleration in international trade raises the question of whether such embodied emission transfers have peaked. Here we update historical analysis, finding that emission transfers between OECD and non-OECD countries peaked in 2006, and have been declining since. The reversal is principally due to the reduction in the emissions intensity of traded goods, rather than the volume of trade. A more recent decline in embodied emissions transfers is also observed in trade between developing countries. We analyse whether these trends are likely to continue, by exploring a baseline and a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) scenario with the Macro-econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model (E3ME) model. The results suggest that absolute embodied emissions will plateau at current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels, and differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC policies will not result in significant carbon leakage. However, the share of national footprint embodied in imports, at least for countries with ambitious decarbonization policies, will likely increase. This suggests that, despite the world-wide stabilization of emissions transfers, addressing emissions embodied in imports will become increasingly important for reducing carbon footprints. Key policy insights Emissions embodied in imports have plateaued since 2006, and are unlikely to return to the peak of the mid-2000s. For developed countries, as domestic decarbonization occurs, the share of emissions embodied in imports as a percentage of the total national carbon footprint will increase. The Paris NDCs in themselves are unlikely to cause significant carbon leakage. Climate policy will ideally focus on reducing both production and consumption emissions, through a variety of mechanisms, especially centred around international assistance.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d95205f73081da1c191d0de1ee7cb2705d25f7d0", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3552838", "MAG": "2123531409", "DOI": "10.1186/1556-276X-7-684", "CorpusId": 11560088, "PubMed": "23259411"}, "title": "Sn-doped In2O3 nanowires: enhancement of electrical field emission by a selective area growth", "abstract": "Selective area growth of single crystalline Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) nanowires synthesized via vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) method at 600\u00b0C was applied to improve the field emission behavior owing to the reduction of screen effect.

While economic analyses generally indicate that a broader market-based approach to GHG reduction would be less costly and more effective, regulatory approaches have found greater political success. We evaluate a global regulatory regime that replaces coal with natural gas in the electricity sector and imposes technically achievable improvements in the efficiency of personal transport vehicles. Its performance and cost are compared with other scenarios of future policy development including a no-policy world, achievements under the Copenhagen Accord, and a price-based policy to reduce global emissions by 50% by 2050. The assumed regulations applied globally achieve a global emissions reduction larger than projected for the Copenhagen agreements, but they do not prevent global GHG emissions from continuing to grow. The reduction in emissions is achieved at a high cost compared to a price-based policy. Diagnosis of the reasons for the limited yet high-cost performance reveals influences including the partial coverage of emitting sectors, small or no influence on the demand for emissions-intensive products, leakage when a reduction in fossil use in the covered sectors lowers the price to others, and the partial coverage of GHGs. If these regulatory measures are in part correcting other barriers or behavioural limitations consumers face, the benefits of overcoming these could offset at least some of the costs we estimate. The extent of any efficiency gap \u2013 the difference between engineering estimates of best practice and what actually happens \u2013 is highly contested, and offers an important avenue for future research. Policy relevance While analysts concerned with national cost of GHG control have long advocated a GHG pricing policy, by a cap-and-trade system or a tax, covering all emissions sources and gases, governments more often pursue sectoral policies and technology standards. Given these political realities, the regulations represent a more politically practical approach to GHG reductions, focusing on solutions that are within reach and that do not depend on technological breakthroughs. If regulations are imposed as a way to get started on larger emissions reductions, and then combined with a broader GHG pricing policy pursuing a deep global cut in emissions, its requirements will eventually be overtaken by the pricing policy. The remaining higher costs of the regulatory targets become diluted so that in later years the difference in average cost per ton between a least-cost approach and one preceded by a period of regulatory action becomes very small.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "8e9a5d262509db11831a79f0e1f51af5bbb1679d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1669107753", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-005-9026-X", "CorpusId": 129197078}, "title": "Climate Strategy with Co2 Capture from the Air", "abstract": "It is physically possible to capture CO2 directly from the air and immobilize it in geological structures. Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First, it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty, so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation. Second, it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third, because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure, air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology.Like geoengineering, air capture limits the cost of a worst-case climate scenario. In an optimal sequential decision framework with uncertainty, existence of air capture decreases the need for near-term precautionary abatement. The long-term effect is the opposite; assuming that marginal costs of mitigation decrease with time while marginal climate change damages increase, then air capture increases long-run abatement.

This paper proposes a torque control strategy coupled with optimization for a parallel HEV. A torque control strategy is developed first. In particular, a function to control the driving condition, called the internal combustion engine (ICE) torque control function, is introduced. This function controls the driving conditions (electric motor (EM) driving, ICE driving, and ICE driving assisted by EM) for reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. This function depends on several design variables that should be optimized. Numerical simulation of HEV using Matlab/Simulink is so computationally intensive that a sequential approximate optimization (SAO) using a radial basis function network (RBF) is adopted to determine the optimal values of these design variables. As the result, the optimal ICE torque control function is determined with a small number of simulation runs. In this paper, CO2 and NOx emissions are minimized simultaneously for reducing the fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Through numerical simulations using typical driving cycles, the trade-off between CO2 and NOx emissions is clarified and the validity of the proposed torque control strategy coupled with the proposed optimization is examined.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "b71a2822148f361066e7120be40ff9190098208c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2005581107", "DOI": "10.1080/10962247.2012.762814", "CorpusId": 35313398, "PubMed": "23687729"}, "title": "Assessment of frequent litter amendment application on ammonia emission from broilers operations", "abstract": "Litter amendments have been used to control the ammonia (NH3) emission from the broiler litter during the brooding period. One of the commercially available litter amendments, sodium bisulfate, was frequently applied on the litter with two different rates on weekly basis in a laboratory setup and with a single rate on biweekly basis under field conditions. Repeated application of sodium bisulfate led to significant reduction in NH3 emissions from broilers. The magnitude of NH3 emission reduction increases with the application rate of sodium bisulfate. The reduction rates of cumulative emissions with 366 g/wk-m2 (75 lb/wk-1000 ft2) rate (from 14% to 64.5%) were higher than the reduction rate of 183 g/wk-m2 (37.5 lb/wk-1000 ft2) rate (from 0% to 55%) from 28 to 61 days of age. The cumulative NH3 emission was reduced by 51.7% with 244 g/2 wk-m2 (50 lb/2 wk-1000 ft2) rate over a three-flock period (8-wk average grow-out per flock) under field production conditions. Sodium bisulfate application showed no significant difference on body weight and feed conversion efficiency. However, footpad quality was significantly improved by sodium bisulfate application. Litter pH and ammonia nitrogen level of the litter were decreased by sodium bisulfate application with both rates. Organic and total nitrogen contents in the litter were higher, whereas less nitrogen was emitted as NH3. The laboratory-scale findings of emission reduction by the additives should be considered to be preliminary if the additives are to be applied under commercial production settings. Implications This work demonstrated that frequent litter amendment application can be used to reduce NH3 emissions from broiler houses, with no adverse effect on the animal production performances. The NH3 reduction rates could vary with different application frequencies and rates. Using litter amendment during broiler grow-out to lower NH3 emissions should be applicable to boiler production systems.

In this study, we model 13 food products and their typical packaging formats through a consistent life cycle assessment framework in order to demonstrate the effect of food waste on overall system greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand (CED). Starting with food waste rate estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we calculate the effect on GHG emissions and CED of a hypothetical 10% decrease in food waste rate. This defines a limit for increases in packaging impacts from innovative packaging solutions that will still lead to net system environmental benefits. The ratio of food production to packaging production environmental impact provides a guide to predicting food waste effects on system performance. Based on a survey of the food LCA literature, this ratio for GHG emissions ranges from 0.06 (wine example) to 780 (beef example). High ratios with foods such as cereals, dairy, seafood, and meats suggest greater opportunity for net impact reductions through packaging\u2010based food waste reduction innovations.

The methods currently adopted to estimate the spatial variation of above- and below-ground biomass in tropical forests, in particular the Brazilian Amazon, are usually based on remote sensing analyses coupled with field datasets, which tend to be relatively scarce and often limited in their spatial distribution. There are notable differences among the resulting biomass maps found in the literature. These differences subsequently result in relatively high uncertainties in the carbon emissions calculated from land use change, and have a larger impact when biomass maps are coded into biomass classes referring to specific ranges of biomass values. In this paper we analyze the differences among recently-published biomass maps of the Amazon region, including the official information used by the Brazilian government for its communication to the United Nation Framework on Climate Change Convention of the United Nations. The estimated average pre-deforestation biomass in the four maps, for the areas of the Amazon region that had been deforested during the 1990\u20132009 period, varied from 205\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 during 1990\u20131999, to 216\u2009\u00b1\u200931\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 during 2000\u20132009. The biomass values of the deforested areas in 2011 were between 7 and 24\u00a0% higher than for the average deforested areas during 1990\u20131999, suggesting that although there was variation in the mean value, deforestation was tending to occur in increasingly carbon-dense areas, with consequences for carbon emissions. To summarize, our key findings were: (i) the current maps of Amazonian biomass show substantial variation in both total biomass and its spatial distribution; (ii) carbon emissions estimates from deforestation are highly dependent on the spatial distribution of biomass as determined by any single biomass map, and on the deforestation process itself; (iii) future deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is likely to affect forests with higher biomass than those deforested in the past, resulting in smaller reductions in carbon dioxide emissions than expected purely from the recent reductions in deforestation rates; and (iv) the current official estimate of carbon emissions from Amazonian deforestation is probably overestimated, because the recent loss of higher-biomass forests has not been taken into account.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b3c4b6dc196ee542843d7560cca0207ca60452d7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2049976088", "DOI": "10.1063/1.125454", "CorpusId": 122391552}, "title": "Effect of growth temperature on photoluminescence of GaNAs/GaAs quantum well structures", "abstract": "The effect of growth temperature on the optical properties of GaAs/GaNxAs1\u2212x quantum wells is studied in detail using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies.

Identification of the fluorescence response with reduction of DPN was supported by determination of excitation and emission spectra of resting tissue at room temperatures and at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The emission spectrum of the fluorescence change after stimulation was also determined with a differential spectrofluorometer. The results of the fluorometry agreed well with those obtained by direct chemical analysis. The time course of the fluorescence response and the effect on it of various factors such as amount of stimulation, interval between periods of stimulation, direction of observation, electrical load, temperature, exclusion of oxygen and inhibitors of oxidative metabolism and glycolysis, are described in some detail. A combination of these observations with the results of chemical analyses and thermal studies supports the view that the sequence of events on stimulation of the electric organ is: (1) changes in internal ionic concentrations resulting from the flow of electric current: (2) activation of the sodium pump, driven by phosphate-bond energy and drawing initially on the reservoir provided by creatine phosphate; (3) activation of glycogenolysis to restore the ATP/ADP ratio.

Our estimated model of vehicle value is used as an input into a simulation model of a 1,000-car fleet representative of California's fleet. Other inputs into the simulation models are the estimated distributions of emissions in the fleet, and two equations that link emissions reductions to the cost of repairs. The simulation model is used to examine the role of scrap policies alone and combined with other policies for reducing emissions, such as current I/M programs and proposed emissions fees, and the welfare implications of combining such programs. The model incorporates both technical and behavioral relationships, and assumes that of all possible options (repairing the car, scrapping the vehicle, or paying the emissions fee without repairing the vehicle) the owner chooses the one with the least cost.

Introduction and scope This paper explores sectoral approaches as a new set of options to enhance the effectiveness of greenhouse gas reduction policies and to engage emerging economies on a lower emission path. It surveys existing literature and recent policy trends in international climate change discussions, and provides an overview of sectoral approaches in specific of trade-exposed, greenhouse-gas intensive industries (cement, iron and steel and cement). It is also based on interviews conducted by the IEA Secretariat in Australia, China, Europe, Japan, and the United States. Sectoral approaches were also discussed during workshops on technology and energy efficiency policies in industry, following the IEA's mandate under the Gleneagles Plan of Action. At their meeting in Heiligendamm, the G8 leaders summarised the challenges ahead for climate policy: they recognise \" that the efforts of developed economies will not be sufficient and that new approaches for contributions by other countries are needed [\u2026] Action of emerging economies could take several forms, such as sustainable development policies and measures, an improved and strengthened clean development mechanism, the setting up of plans for the sectors that generate most pollution so as to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions compared with a business as usual scenario. \" Further, the communiqu\u00e9 stresses the need for \" policy frameworks that coordinate rather than compete with each other [\u2026] \" As countries embark on a new round of climate policy negotiations, they need to consider the implications of various emission goals, starting from their knowledge of potentials for greenhouse gas reductions, and their cost. 1 In parallel, we observe also country pledges on energy efficiency and international collaboration on specific sectors, including industry.

Some gaze at its text and see a battle won. They cheer the fact that the generally richer nations participating in the protocol agreed to cut their collective emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming to around five percent less than 1990 levels by early in the next century. These optimists also applaud features of the Kyoto accord designed to hold down the costs of achieving these reductions. In computing their emissions, nations can include changes in the six major greenhouse gases emitted because of human activity, not just carbon dioxide, the most important of the six. In addition, countries can factor in reduced carbon dioxide levels from changes in land use and new forestry techniques that take the gas out of the atmosphere. Groups of participating nations may comply jointly and reallocate commitments among themselves, as the European Union (EU) plans to do within a European \u201cbubble,\u201d and there is agreement in principle to some form of emissions trading. Joint implementation, under which agents in one country can get credit for reductions they achieve in another, is to be permitted between participating nations, and a new \u201cClean Development Mechanism\u201d will provide access to these opportunities in nonparticipating countries, mainly in the developing world. Finally, emissions targets are not rigidly tied to a single year, but to averages over a five-year \u201ccommitment period\u201d from 2008 to 2012. Pessimists, on the other hand, see Kyoto as a costly defeat. They note that there is no solid proof that human-induced climate change will occur or that its adverse effects would be serious were it to happen. At the same time, the expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Kyoto targets will be substantial, and pessimists believe that the effort will make participating countries less competitive. In the darkest interpretation, the Kyoto agreement is a pact among rich nations that will cripple their economies for decades to come, made simply because today\u2019s political leaders needed to burnish their environmental credentials. Neither of these schools is correct. Still a third group, whose views are much closer to the mark, believes that Kyoto mainly postpones much needed work on what may prove a very serious longterm challenge. To them, Kyoto is a quick political fix to a problem created at the First Conference of Parties to the Climate convention held in Berlin in 1995. The so-called Berlin mandate instructed negotiators to seek short-term, legally binding targets and timetables for emission control for participating countries only. In the run-up to Kyoto, many leaders publicly committed themselves to this idea. Not surprisingly, avoiding embarrassment on this score became the dominant focus of the negotiations. As a result, this group argues, the Kyoto agreement allows political leaders to declare success, but it does not address the larger climate issues at stake.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "d590029ad9c4484337ca92858792a44be985d7e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2168674769", "CorpusId": 2290229}, "title": "The Economic and Environmental Effects of Border Tax Adjustments for Climate Policy", "abstract": "For the foreseeable future, climate change policy will be considerably more stringent in some countries than in others.

In high-cost countries, there will be political pressure to impose border adjustments, or \u201cgreen tariffs\u201d, on imports from countries with little or no climate policy and low energy costs. The adjustments would be based on the carbon emissions associated with production of each imported product, and would be intended to match the cost increase that would have occurred had the exporting country adopted a climate policy similar to that of the importing country. In this paper, we estimate how large such tariffs would be in practice, and then examine their economic and environmental effects using G-Cubed, a detailed multi-sector, multi-country model of the world economy. We find that the tariffs would be small on most traded goods, would reduce leakage of emissions reduction very modestly, and would do little to protect import-competing industries.

In what may be the first such comprehensive inventory conducted for a U.S. state, we find that consumption-based emissions for Oregon are 47% higher than those released in-state. This finding implies that Oregon's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint) is considerably higher than traditional production-based methods would suggest. Furthermore, the consumption-based inventory helps highlight the role of goods and services (and associated purchasing behaviors) more so than do production-based methods. Accordingly, a consumption-based perspective opens new opportunities for many states and their local government partners to reduce GHG emissions, such as initiatives to advance lower-carbon public sector or household consumption, that are well within their sphere of influence. State and local governments should consider conducting consumption-based GHG inventories and adopting consumption-based emission reductions targets in order to broaden the reach and effectiveness of state and local actions in reducing global GHG emissions.

Reduction in N2O production under biochar amendment was due to increases in soil pH and decreases in the magnitude of mineral-N in soil. Although, both dolomite and biochar increased cumulative CO2 emission, only biochar amendment had a significant effect. The present study suggests that application of dolomite and biochar to acidic tea field soil can mitigate N2O emissions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e7f5574aebea80703bf83644208cd1cc4c7953f4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2013583791", "DOI": "10.1007/S11340-008-9125-5", "CorpusId": 137272968}, "title": "Kinematic Fields and Acoustic Emission Observations Associated with the Portevin Le Ch\u00e2telier Effect on an Al\u2013Mg Alloy", "abstract": "This paper presents experimental tensile test results obtained on flat aluminum magnesium alloy samples on a hard machine.

Using a hybrid multiregional input-output model, to avoid truncation while diminishing sector aggregation problems and to improve environmental leakages estimations, we calculate the CO2 equivalent emissions associated with the different phases of the nuclear life-cycle--construction, fuel processing and operation and maintenance--taking into account the countries or regions where the emissions have been generated. Our results estimate a nuclear carbon footprint of 21.30 gCO2e/kWh, of which 89% comes from regions outside Spain. In some regions, the highest impacts are mostly direct (92%, 95%, and 92% of total carbon emissions in the U.S., France, and UK, respectively), meaning that these emissions are linked to the inputs directly required for nuclear energy production; in other regions, indirect emissions are higher (83% in China), which becomes relevant for policy measures.

In order to separate the impact of the anthropogenic emissions and natural variability on atmospheric chemistry, we compare two model experiments, driven by the same ECMWF re-analysis data, but with varying and constant an- thropogenic emissions, respectively. Our model analysis in- dicates an increase of ca. 1 ppbv (0.055 \u00b1 0.002 ppbv yr 1 ) in global average surface O3 concentrations due to anthro- pogenic emissions, but this trend is largely masked by the larger O3 anomalies due to the variability of meteorology and natural emissions. The changes in meteorology (not includ- ing stratospheric variations) and natural emissions account for the 75 % of the total variability of global average sur- face O3 concentrations. Regionally, annual mean surface O3 concentrations increased by 1.3 and 1.6 ppbv over Eu- rope and North America, respectively, despite the large an- thropogenic emission reductions between 1980 and 2005. A comparison of winter and summer O3 trends with mea- surements shows a qualitative agreement, except in North America, where our model erroneously computed a posi- tive trend. Simulated O3 increases of more than 4 ppbv in East Asia and 5 ppbv in South Asia can not be corroborated with long-term observations.

Emission data were collected for vehicles operating over the Federal Test Procedure at 90 \u00b0F, 75 \u00b0F, and 40 \u00b0F to simulate ambient driving conditions. The two fuels tested were a commercial summer-grade regular gasoline (the nonoxygenated base fuel) and an oxygenated fuel containing 8.8% ethanol, more paraffins and olefins, and less aromatics than the base fuel. The Reid vapor pressure (RVP) was adjusted to correspond to that of the base fuel. The emissions measured were total hydrocarbons (THCs), speciated hydrocarbons, spedated aldehydes, carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOX). This study showed a general reduction in tailpipe emissions of THC, CO, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene when tested with the ethanol fuel. The ethanol fuel significantly reduced these emissions from the high emitting vehicle, MU098, at 90 \u00b0F, 75 \u00b0F, and 40 \u00b0F test temperatures. Additionally, the ethanol fuel reduced CO emissions from vehicle BU950, with and without catalyst, and from vehicle CI415 at 40 \u00b0F.

At the engine standard settings, particle number and NOx emissions decreased at all the studied load points (50%, 75%, and 100%) when the fuel was changed from EN590 to HVO.

The HVO fuel decreased PAH emissions mainly due to the absence of aromatics. Aldehyde emissions were lower with the HVO fuel with medium (50%) load. At higher loads (75% and 100%), aldehyde emissions were slightly higher with the HVO fuel. However, the aldehyde emission levels were quite low, so no clear conclusions on the effect of fuel can be made. Overall, the study indicates that paraffinic HVO fuels are suitable for emission reduction with valve and injection timing adjustment and thus provide possibilities for engine manufacturers to meet the strictening emission limits.

New, biobased paraffinic fuels and modern engine technologies have been reported to lower both of these emissions. In this study, even further reductions were achieved with engine valve adjustment combined with novel hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) diesel fuel.

We also discovered 26 Ly alpha emitting galaxies that are not detected in the HST WFPC2 deep broad-band images. The intermediate spectral resolution of 2.3 angstrom allows us to separate resolved asymmetric Ly alpha emitters, [O II] 3727 emitters, and C III] 1908 emitters, and the broad instantaneous wavelength range of 4500 angstrom helps to identify single emission lines, such as [O III] 5007, H beta, and H alpha, over a very wide redshift range.

Concentrations can be reduced by controlling emissions, increasing dispersion, or increasing deposition rates, but little attention has been paid to the latter as a pollution control method. Both NO(2) and PM are deposited onto surfaces at rates that vary according to the nature of the surface; deposition rates to vegetation are much higher than those to hard, built surfaces. Previously, city-scale studies have suggested that deposition to vegetation can make a very modest improvement (<5%) to urban air quality. However, few studies take full account of the interplay between urban form and vegetation, specifically the enhanced residence time of air in street canyons. This study shows that increasing deposition by the planting of vegetation in street canyons can reduce street-level concentrations in those canyons by as much as 40% for NO(2) and 60% for PM.

This work summarizes an internal research effort conducted at Southwest Research Institute. Meeting new, stringent emissions regulations for diesel engines requires a way to reduce NO x and soot emissions. Most emissions reduction strategies reduce one pollutant while increasing the other. Water injection is one of the few promising emissions reduction techniques with the potential to simultaneously reduce soot and NO x in diesel engines. While it is widely accepted that water reduces NO x via a thermal effect, the mechanisms behind the reduction of soot are not well understood. The water could reduce the soot via physical, thermal, or chemical effects. To aid in developing water injection strategies, this project's goal was to determine how water enters the soot formation chemistry. Linked burner experiments and modeling of a rich premixed flame were used to determine the magnitude of the thermal and chemical effect of water on soot formation and identify a possible kinetic mechanism to explain it. Following Dec's model for diesel combustion processes (Dec, 1997; Flynn, et al., 1999) [1,19] , soot inception results from rich premixed combustion; thus the rich premixed flame provides an appropriate venue in which to isolate the influence of water on the kinetics. Open flame, burner experiments have been performed to quantify the soot inception point and the relative amounts of soot formation in premixed flames with and without water addition. These results have been used to expand and compliment data available in the published literature. Subsequent modeling has been used to predict trends in soot inception using currently accepted kinetic soot mechanisms. Results from this effort led to a revised kinetic mechanism for the process. Comparison of the experimental and modeling data has been used to assess the accuracy of soot formation mechanisms and ultimately has yielded a new understanding of the soot formation chemistry and the role of added water.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "63bce1cfdc12fee74f5bca14737a8781044e0048", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901609363", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENECO.2018.11.006", "CorpusId": 158965023}, "title": "Sources of emission reductions: Market and policy-stringency effects", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "6643bb64ff5349987f608904289f07f7a1aa922a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2414188854", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2016.1173005", "CorpusId": 156300056}, "title": "The need for national deep decarbonization pathways for effective climate policy", "abstract": "Constraining global average temperatures to 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels will probably require global energy system emissions to be halved by 2050 and complete decarbonization by 2100. In the nationally orientated climate policy framework codified under the Paris Agreement, each nation must decide the scale and method of their emissions reduction contribution while remaining consistent with the global carbon budget. This policy process will require engagement amongst a wide range of stakeholders who have very different visions for the physical implementation of deep decarbonization. The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) has developed a methodology, building on the energy, climate and economics literature, to structure these debates based on the following principles: country-scale analysis to capture specific physical, economic and political circumstances to maximize policy relevance, a long-term perspective to harmonize short-term decisions with the long-term objective and detailed sectoral analysis with transparent representation of emissions drivers through a common accounting framework or \u2018dashboard\u2019.

Future targets in reducing -emissions with regard to global warming effects can be met with the help of these engines. A major disadvantage of diesel engines is the high soot and nitrogen oxide emissions which cannot be reduced completely with only engine measures today. The present paper describes two different possibilities for the simultaneous in-cylinder reduction of soot and nitrogen oxide emissions. One possibility is the optimization of the injection process with a new injection strategy the other one is the use of water diesel emulsions with the conventional injection system. The new injection strategy for this experimental part of the study overcomes the problem of increased soot emissions with pilot injection by separating the injections spatially and therefore on the one hand reduces the soot formation during the early stages of the combustion and on the other hand increases the soot oxidation later during the combustion. Another method to reduce the emissions is the introduction of water into the combustion chamber. Emulsions of water and fuel offer the potential to simultaneously reduce and soot emissions while maintaining a high-thermal efficiency.
