Using state and country level data, net emissions of mercury from the marginal use of fluorescent lightbulbs are examined for a base year of 2004 for each of the 50 United States and 130 countries. Combustion of coal for electric power generation is generally the largest source of atmospheric mercury pollution; reduction in electricity demand from the substitution of incandescent bulbs with fluorescents leads to reduced mercury emissions during the use of the bulb. This analysis considers the local mix of power sources, coal quality, thermal conversion efficiencies, distribution losses, and any mercury control technologies that might be in place. Emissions of mercury from production and end-of-life treatment of the bulbs are also considered, providing a life-cycle perspective.

Increased production of oil and natural gas, particularly from shale resources using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, made the United States the world\u2019s largest producer of oil and natural gas in 2014. This review examines air quality impacts, specifically, changes in greenhouse gas, criteria air pollutant, and air toxics emissions from oil and gas production activities that are a result of these changes in energy supplies and use. National emission inventories indicate that volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from oil and gas supply chains in the United States have been increasing significantly, whereas emission inventories for greenhouse gases have seen slight declines over the past decade. These emission inventories are based on counts of equipment and operational activities (activity factors), multiplied by average emission factors, and therefore are subject to uncertainties in these factors. Although uncertainties associated with activity data and missing emission source types can be significant, multiple recent measurement studies indicate that the greatest uncertainties are associated with emission factors. In many source categories, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. When super-emitters are accounted for, multiple measurement approaches, at multiple scales, produce similar results for estimated emissions. Challenges moving forward include identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes. Work done to date suggests that both equipment malfunction and operational practices can be important. Finally, although most of this review focuses on emissions from energy supply infrastructures, the regional air quality implications of some coupled energy production and use scenarios are examined. These case studies suggest that both energy production and use should be considered in assessing air quality implications of changes in energy infrastructures, and that impacts are likely to vary among regions. Implications: The energy supply infrastructure in the United States has been changing dramatically over the past decade, leading to changes in emissions from oil and natural gas supply chain sources. In many source categories along these supply chains, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. Effective emission reductions will require technologies for both identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d6d960e98353925f0fc804a7cdedf112f5c87245", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1600145079", "CorpusId": 108552644}, "title": "TRANSPORTATION FUELS AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT", "abstract": "Continued emissions of CO{sub 2} and other greenhouse gases are expected to cause substantial global warming with adverse consequences for agriculture and coastal cities, yet emission of greenhouse gases has not been a criterion in evaluation of alternative transportation fuels. In this paper these are evaluated emissions of CO{sub 2}, N{sub 2}O, and other greenhouse gases from the use of gasoline and diesel fuel, electricity, methanol, natural gas, and hydrogen in highway vehicles. Emissions from initial resource extraction to end use are estimated. It is found that the use of coal to make any highway fuel would substantially accelerate greenhouse warming relative to the base-case use of petroleum. The use of natural gas as a feedstock would result in a small reduction. Significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases can be achieved only by greatly increasing vehicle efficiency or by using biofuels, electrolytic hydrogen, or nonfossil-fuel-based electricity as the fuel feedstock.

The transportation sector is the top GHG emitter in California, contributing roughly 40 percent of all California emissions. Poor fuel efficiency and high vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are primary contributors to transportation sector GHG emissions. Meeting California\u2019s GHG emissions reduction goals requires reductions in both per-mile emissions and vehicle miles traveled. Fuel efficiency has been addressed historically by federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and California has passed its own legislation regulating GHG emissions from vehicles. Vehicle miles traveled, however, have historically not received legislative attention, and have been growing at a much faster rate than population or the economy. There is consequently a 'VMT gap' in the current regulatory structure for GHG emissions reductions envisioned under AB 32. This Article addresses how AB 32\u2019s developing market-based GHG emissions reduction policy, allowing for carbon offsets, could interact with implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to support emissions reductions from transportation-related land use projects. Allowing carbon offsets for CEQA land use projects requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to acknowledge that the degree of GHG mitigation required for transportation-related land use projects is discretionary under the CEQA process; otherwise, CARB would face the legal conundrum of allowing industry to claim offset credits for mitigation considered compulsory under a separate legal statute. Carbon offsets for CEQA mitigation should be recognized as being additional to emissions reductions that would otherwise take place without offset investment dollars. This is because significant land use changes are necessary to meet California\u2019s long-term GHG reduction goals and it should be a legal priority to facilitate these changes. This outcome would be most consistent with the existing CEQA regime and would increase incentives and funding available to implement GHG emissions reductions from land use-related projects. Further, we recommend that a regional transportation authority (also known as a Metropolitan Planning Organization or MPO) - the same agency charged with modeling the impacts of future development plans on GHG emissions under recent legislation designed to address vehicle miles traveled (under SB 375) - facilitate quality offset projects and coordinate offset investment dollars for CEQA mitigation. We argue that such a carbon offset program under AB 32 will prove to be more significant than SB 375 in addressing vehicle miles traveled by promoting increased investments in transportation-related land use projects.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "3399219b01ec46ba053ae76364a9d0c47ed6643a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2073597774", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1890476", "CorpusId": 123052417}, "title": "Application of the thermionic field emission model in the study of a Schottky barrier of Ni on p-GaN from current\u2013voltage measurements", "abstract": "Barrier height values of Ni contacts to Mg-doped p-type GaN (p-GaN) were obtained from current\u2013voltage measurements in this study.

A carbon footprint is provided as a tool to quantify the life cycle GHG emissions and identify opportunities to reduce climate change impacts. This study examined three mainstream wastewater treatment technologies: Anaerobic\u2013Anoxic\u2013Oxic (A\u2013A\u2013O), Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) and Oxygen Ditch, considering four different sludge treatment alternatives for small-to-medium-sized WWTPs.

Results found that direct emissions of CO2 and N2O, and indirect emissions of electricity use, are significant contributors to the carbon footprint. Although sludge anaerobic digestion and biogas recovery could significantly contribute to emission reduction, it was less beneficial for Oxygen Ditch than the other two treatment technologies due to its low sludge production.

Oxygen Ditch was assessed as \u201clow risk\u201d of N2O emissions while SBR was \u201chigh risk\u201d. The carbon footprint of A\u2013A\u2013O with sludge anaerobic digestion and energy recovery was more resilient to changes of N2O emission factors and control of N2O emissions, though process design parameters (i.e., effluent total nitrogen (TN) concentration, mixed-liquor recycle (MLR) rates and solids retention time (SRT)) and operation conditions (i.e., nitrite concentration) are critical for reducing carbon footprint of SBR. Analyses of carbon footprints suggested that aerobic treatment of sludge not only favors the generation of large amounts of CO2, but also the emissions of N2O, so the rationale of reducing aerobic treatment and maximizing anaerobic treatment applies to both wastewater and sludge treatment for reducing the carbon footprint, i.e., the annamox process for wastewater nutrient removal and the anaerobic digestion for sludge treatment.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "b51efa175a8a25463a31761392195a966270bacb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2405441282", "DOI": "10.15282/IJAME.12.2015.6.0241", "CorpusId": 53117994}, "title": "Comparative study of diesel engine performance and emission with soybean and waste oil biodiesel fuels", "abstract": "The study investigated the engine performance and emission using biodiesel from soybean oil and waste cooking oil.

Meanwhile, the model is able to take account of the integer variables and nonlinearity of the operational cost together with network constraints and renewable generation expansion in one long-term generation planning model. The problem is solved by an innovative discrete gradient search method, and a new concept, emission reduction cost (ERC), is developed, which helps determine which generation technology is the most cost efficient in emission reduction during different stages of generation expansion. A case study on a modified IEEE 30-bus system is presented to demonstrate the application of this model and the value of considering short-term emission costs and the network constraints on the long-term generation expansion.

Systemic defenses can be induced internally by signals transported via phloem or xylem, or externally transmitted by volatiles emitted from the damaged tissues. We investigated the role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) in activating a defense response between branches in blueberry plants. Blueberries are perennial shrubs that grow by initiating adventitious shoots from a basal crown, which produce new lateral branches. This type of growth constrains vascular connections between shoots and branches within plants. While we found that leaves within a branch were highly connected, vascular connectivity was limited between branches within shoots and absent between branches from different shoots. Larval feeding by gypsy moth, exogenous methyl jasmonate, and mechanical damage differentially induced volatile emissions in blueberry plants, and there was a positive correlation between amount of insect damage and volatile emission rates. Herbivore damage did not affect systemic defense induction when we isolated systemic branches from external exposure to HIPVs. Thus, internal signals were not capable of triggering systemic defenses among branches. However, exposure of branches to HIPVs from an adjacent branch decreased larval consumption by 70% compared to those exposed to volatiles from undamaged branches. This reduction in leaf consumption did not result in decreased volatile emissions, indicating that leaves became more responsive to herbivory (or \u201cprimed\u201d) after being exposed to HIPVs. Chemical profiles of leaves damaged by gypsy moth caterpillars, exposed to HIPVs, or non-damaged controls revealed that HIPV-exposed leaves had greater chemical similarities to damaged leaves than to control leaves. Insect-damaged leaves and young HIPV-exposed leaves had higher amounts of endogenous cis-jasmonic acid compared to undamaged and non-exposed leaves, respectively. Our results show that exposure to HIPVs triggered systemic induction of direct defenses against gypsy moth and primed volatile emissions, which can be an indirect defense.

These studies have shown that the rate at which cocaine and methylphenidate enter the brain and block the dopamine transporters (DAT) is the variable associated with the `high', rather than the presence per se of the drug in the brain. Our studies also show that, while the level of DAT blockade is important in predicting the intensity of the `high' induced by these drugs (DAT blockade 450% is required for these drugs to induce a `high'), the rate at which DAT are blocked determines whether the `high' is perceived or not. Thus, oral methylphenidate, which leads to slow DAT blockade, does not induce a `high', even at doses which block DAT more than 60%. In cocaine abusers, we have shown significant reductions in DA D2 receptors that are associated with decreased metabolism in cingulate gyrus and in orbitofrontal cortex. We suggest that this is one of the mechanisms by which DA disruption leads to compulsive drug administration in cocaine addiction. Cocaine abusers also show significant decreases in DA release, which coupled with the reduction in D2 receptors may result in decreased activation of reward circuits by physiological reinforcers and may perpetuate cocaine use as a means to compensate for this deficit.

Exhaust Gas Recirculation is an effective technique in controlling oxides of nitrogen in diesel engines but do not become attractive at higher loads and higher percentage of recirculated gas as combustion tends to deteriorate at higher loads leading to reduced engine thermal efficiency and increased hydrocarbon and smoke emission.

Our results reaffirmed the low energy conversion efficiency of the meat supply chain (among which beef was the least efficient) and the high GHG emissions at the meat production stage.

Guangdong Province (GD), one of the most prosperous and populous regions in\nChina, still experiences haze events and growing ozone pollution in spite of\nthe substantial air-quality improvement in recent years. Integrated control\nof fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone in GD calls for a\nsystematic review of historical emissions. In this study, emission trends,\nspatial variations, source-contribution variations, and reduction potentials\nof sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), PM2.5,\ninhalable particles (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3),\nand volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in GD from 2006 to 2015 were first\nexamined using a dynamic methodology, taking into account economic\ndevelopment, technology penetration, and emission controls. The relative\nchange rates of anthropogenic emissions in GD during 2006\u20132015 are \u221248\u2009%\nfor SO2, \u22120.5\u2009% for NOx, \u221216\u2009% for PM2.5, \u221222\u2009% for\nPM10, 13\u2009% for CO, 3\u2009% for NH3, and 13\u2009% for VOCs. The\ndeclines of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 emissions in the\nwhole province mainly resulted from the stringent emission control in\nthe Pearl River delta (PRD) region, where most previous control measures\nwere focused, especially on power plants (SO2 and NOx), industrial\ncombustion (SO2, PM2.5, PM10), on-road mobile sources\n(NOx), and dust sources (PM2.5 and PM10). Emissions from other\nareas (non-PRD, NPRD), nevertheless, remain relatively stable due to the\nlax control measures and rapidly growing energy consumption. In addition,\nemission leaks of SO2 and NOx from industries are observed from PRD\nto NPRD in 2010 and 2011. As a result, emissions in NPRD are increasingly\nimportant in GD, particularly those from industrial combustion. The contribution\nof NPRD to the total SO2 emissions in GD, for example, increased from\n27\u2009% in 2006 to 48\u2009% in 2015. On-road mobile sources and solvent use are\nthe two key sources that should receive more effective control measures in\nGD. Current control-driven emission reductions from on-road mobile sources are neutralized\nby the substantial growth of the vehicle population, while VOC emissions in GD\nsteadily increase due to the growth of solvent use and the absence of\neffective control measures. Besides, future work could focus on power plants\nand industrial combustion in GD and industrial process sources in NPRD, which\nstill have large emission reduction potentials. The historical emission\ninventory developed in this study not only helps to understand the emission\nevolution in GD, but also provides robust data to quantify the impact of\nemission and meteorology variations on air quality and unveil the primary\ncause of significant air-quality change in GD in the recent decade.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "4dca2c3ae7e3e89b514c09d5259355451bec0403", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2002006205", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.59.10.1148", "CorpusId": 20478059, "PubMed": "19842323"}, "title": "Effect of Open Channel Filter on Particle Emissions of Modern Diesel Engine", "abstract": "Abstract Particle emissions of modern diesel engines are of a particular interest because of their negative health effects.

Liquid products are particularly desirable as an easily storable and portable energy-dense form. To be widely implemented, CO2 electroreduction technologies must be able to produce chemicals at costs that are economically competitive with existing commercial prices. In this work, four possible routes to the electrochemical synthesis of liquid products from CO2 derived from post-combustion flue gas were compared with one consistent approach to technoeconomic analysis. In the first case, diesel fuel was produced from electrosynthesized CO plus H2 to make syngas which was subsequently converted through the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process. Liquid ethanol was modeled through two comparable approaches, a one-step electrolysis and a two-step cascade electrolysis. Lastly, the direct electrosynthesis of formic acid from CO2 was considered. In the base case scenarios established on current state-of-the-art CO2 reduction research, none of the processes were modeled to be competitive with present fuel prices. High capital expense for the electrolyzer units was the primary limiting factor. With conceivable improvements in an optimistic scenario, the diesel process was projected to have the best pathway to making cost-effective fuels, while ethanol would be prohibitively expensive without major improvements to the present electrosynthesis performance. Formic acid, though projected to be expensive relative to its stored energy content, was projected to have perhaps the simplest pathway to production at costs competitive with its commercial bulk price. In each case, the levelized cost of the liquid product was most strongly influenced by parameters that affect the electrolyzer capital cost (i.e., current density, faradaic efficiency, and cost per electrode area).", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3660ba5201c45905ebdc9e9ec45377087beb13c1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2031021507", "DOI": "10.1021/ic503072u", "CorpusId": 23954408, "PubMed": "25894718"}, "title": "Diversity of copper(I) complexes showing thermally activated delayed fluorescence: basic photophysical analysis.", "abstract": "A comparison of three copper(I) compounds [1, Cu(dppb)(pz2Bph2); 2, Cu(pop)(pz2Bph2); 3, Cu(dmp)(phanephos)(+)] that show pronounced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) at ambient temperature demonstrates a wide diversity of emission behavior.

All three compounds, with emission quantum yields higher than \u03d5PL = 70%, are potentially well suited as emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on the singlet-harvesting mechanism.

Fundamental performance differences between heat-exchanged cores and a conventional core are discussed and quantified.

The research work presented in this paper concludes with a full assessment at aircraft system level that reveals the significant potential performance benefits for the intercooled and intercooled recuperated cycles. An intercooled core can be designed for a significantly higher overall pressure ratio and with reduced cooling air requirements, providing a higher thermal efficiency than could otherwise be practically achieved with a conventional core. Variable geometry can be implemented to optimize the use of the intercooler for a given flight mission. An intercooled recuperated core can provide high thermal efficiency at low overall pressure ratio values and also benefit significantly from the introduction of a variable geometry low pressure turbine.

Since echo delay is perceptually equivalent to target range, the experiment effectively measured sensitivity to targets at different ranges. The bat's threshold for detecting sonar echoes at a short delay of only 1.0 msec after emissions (corresponding to a range of 17 cm) was 36 dB SPL (peak to peak), but the threshold decreased to 8 dB SPL at a longer delay of 6.4 msec (a range of 1.1 m). Prior research has shown that, at even longer delays (corresponding to ranges of 3 to 5 m), the bat's threshold is in the region of 0 dB SPL. Contractions of the bat's middle ear muscles synchronized with the production of echolocation sounds cause a transient loss in hearing sensitivity which appears to account for the observed echo detection threshold shifts. The bat's echo detection thresholds increase by approximately 11 dB for each reduction in target range by a factor of 2 over the span from 17 cm to 1.1 m. As range shortens, the amplitude of echoes from small targets also increases, by 12 dB for each 2-fold reduction in range. Thus, when approaching a target, the bat compensates for changes in echo strength as target range shortens by changing its hearing threshold. Since this compensation appears to occur in the middle ear, the bat regulates echoes reaching the cochlea to a stable amplitude during its approach to a target such as a flying insect. In addition to this automatic gain control linked to target range, the bat aims its head to track a target's position during approach, thus stabilizing echo amplitude even if the target's direction changes. We hypothesize that the bat's directional emissions, directional hearing, middle ear muscle contractions, and head aim response collectively create a three- dimensional spatial tracking filter which the bat locks onto targets to stabilize echo amplitudes during interception of prey. We further hypothesize that this regulation, which cancels echo amplitude changes caused by the target's changing spatial position, leaves the bat free to observe echo amplitude changes caused by the target's own actions, such as insect wing beats. Elimination of spatially dependent echo amplitude changes removes the cause of potentially troublesome changes in neural response latency and keeps stimulation from echoes in the \u201ctip\u201d region of auditory nerve fiber tuning curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "year": 1984}, {"paperId": "b1256cf8f5f8932b560613ee9e009b3713e9ef25", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1917697174", "CorpusId": 53982295}, "title": "EUAs and CERs: Vector Autoregression, Impulse Response Function and Cointegration Analysis", "abstract": "EUAs are European Union Allowances traded on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), while Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) arise from the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol.

By the end of 2012, air-cooled coal-fired thermal power plants in China amounted to 112 GW, making up 14% of China's thermal power generation capacity.

We estimate that in 2012 the deployment of air-cooled units contributed an additional 24.3-31.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (equivalent to 0.7-1.0% of the total CO2 emissions by China's electric power sector), while saving 832-942 million m(3) of consumptive water use (about 60% of the total annual water use of Beijing) when compared to a scenario with water-cooled plants. Additional CO2 emissions from air-cooled plants largely offset the CO2 emissions reduction benefits from Chinese policies of retiring small and outdated coal plants. This water-carbon trade-off is poised to become even more significant by 2020, as air-cooled units are expected to grow by a factor of 2-260 GW, accounting for 22% of China's total coal-fired power generation capacity.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "335084b5a13c81df4e033497fac66d7aeba0f943", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1968536863", "DOI": "10.1002/ana.1049", "CorpusId": 11862606, "PubMed": "11456307"}, "title": "Subclinical dopaminergic dysfunction in asymptomatic Parkinson's disease patients' relatives with a decreased sense of smell", "abstract": "By the time a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is made, a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons has already occurred.

The use of PFC gases in these processes is crucial to the production of semiconductor devices, as there are no effective substitutes that can be utilized. Although PFC emissions caused by the semiconductor industry are a tiny fraction of all industry greenhouse gases emissions, the world's semiconductor manufacturers, assembled in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and its affiliated associations, have officially agreed to voluntarily reduce atmospheric emissions of PFCs to 10% below baseline levels in 2010. The WSC has established a reporting program to track PFC emissions by the present five semiconductor manufacturing associations (USA, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Korea). Data released by the WSC today show that the 2008 PFC emissions in most regions are already below the target set for 2010. This cooperative effort by the members of the WSC to reduce PFC emissions is an excellent example of what can be accomplished by collaboration. Because the PFC emission reduction program is considered to be pre-competitive, members freely share information on techniques and strategies. One of the key success factors has also been the strong involvement of equipment and gas suppliers to the semiconductor industry. Key measures that have contributed to substantially reduce PFC emissions are, among others, installation of dedicated post process tool PFC abatement, and application of NF3 gas in combination with so-called remote plasma in chamber cleans. The latter affords a highly efficient process alternative for the semiconductor industry with minimal PFC emission footprint, since the NF3 is utilized with better than 98% conversion efficiency. A gradual trend is visible, i.e. more advanced tools and facilities with relatively low emissions are supplanting relatively old tools and facilities with relatively high emission profiles. Presently, the global semiconductor industry is considering whether and how PFC emissions can be further reduced post-2010. A new global agreement should include other relevant regions with substantial semiconductor production, such as China and Singapore. Such discussions have already commenced. One of the key elements in a new agreement is harmonization of regional reporting. Moreover, it should be emphasized that semiconductor manufacture is no longer the sole or even the largest industry that makes use of PFCs. In this respect, the production of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) and the manufacture of photovoltaic cells are likely to become major players.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "d379b1af3b4559243cbb71b678b529de0b2076cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1917473908", "DOI": "10.2307/3146853", "CorpusId": 14309855}, "title": "Mitigating Climate Change by Planting Trees: The Transaction Costs Trap", "abstract": "Land-use change and forestry projects are considered a low-cost option for addressing climate change mitigation.

The model includes temperature and CO2 feedbacks on the terrestrial biosphere, and temperature feedback on the oceanic uptake of CO2. The scenarios used include cases in which fossil fuel CO2 emissions are held constant at the 1986 value or increase by 1% yr\u22121 until either 2000 or 2020, followed by a gradual transition to a rate of decrease of 1 or 2% yr\u22121. The climatic effect of increases in non-CO2 trace gases is included, and scenarios are considered in which these gases increase until 2075 or are stabilized once CO2 emission reductions begin. Low and high deforestation scenarios are also considered. In all cases, results are computed for equilibrium climatic sensitivities to CO2 doubling of 2.0 and 4.0 \u00b0C.Peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 400\u2013500 ppmv and global mean warming after 1980 of 0.6\u20133.2 \u00b0C occur, with maximum rates of global mean warming of 0.2\u20130.3 \u00b0C decade\u22121. The peak CO2 concentrations in these scenarios are significantly below that commonly regarded as unavoidable; further sensitivity analyses suggest that limiting atmospheric CO2 to as little as 400 ppmv is a credible option.Two factors in the model are important in limiting atmospheric CO2: (1) the airborne fraction falls rapidly once emissions begin to decrease, so that total emissions (fossil fuel + land use-induced) need initially fall to only about half their present value in order to stabilize atmospheric CO2, and (2) changes in rates of deforestation have an immediate and proportional effect on gross emissions from the biosphere, whereas the CO2 sink due to regrowth of forests responds more slowly, so that decreases in the rate of deforestation have a disproportionately large effect on net emission.If fossil fuel emissions were to decrease at 1\u20132% yr\u22121 beginning early in the next century, emissions could decrease to the rate of CO2 uptake by the predominantly oceanic sink within 50\u2013100 yrs. Simulation results suggest that if subsequent emission reductions were tied to the rate of CO2 uptake by natural CO2 sinks, these reductions could proceed more slowly than initially while preventing further CO2 increases, since the natural CO2 sink strength decreases on time scales of one to several centuries. The model used here does not account for the possible effect on atmospheric CO2 concentration of possible changes in oceanic circulation. Based on past rates of atmospheric CO2 variation determined from polar ice cores, it appears that the largest plausible perturbation in ocean-air CO2 flux due to changes of oceanic circulation is substantially smaller than the permitted fossil fuel CO2 emissions under the above strategy, so tieing fossil fuel emissions to the total sink strength could provide adequate flexibility for responding to unexpected changes in oceanic CO2 uptake caused by climatic warming-induced changes of oceanic circulation.", "year": 1989}, {"paperId": "a15e85d44a9c8a536beac348a5887899eb23c382", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071415671", "DOI": "10.1002/EJIC.200400844", "CorpusId": 97507412}, "title": "Multi\u2010Channel Receptors and Their Relation to Guest Chemosensing and Reconfigurable Molecular Logic Gates", "abstract": "The synthesis and characterisation of a family of multi-channel receptors containing crown-cation binding sites anchored to a 1-aminophenyl-1,2,2-tricyanoethylene group is reported.

Using computational analysis, it is shown that lower exhaust soot emissions for the lower EGR dilution cases (45 per cent) are due to higher soot oxidation rates, and lower exhaust soot emissions for very high EGR rates (70 per cent) are due to lower soot formation rates.

This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London. Methods Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools. Results This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases.

Methods: Using an electronic database (Medline), we reviewed imaging studies that have evaluated resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting glucose metabolism or amyloid deposition in groups of subjects suffering AD or HF compared with healthy controls. Results: Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) investigations have reported global CBF reductions in HF groups compared with controls. In one recent SPECT study using modern voxel-based methods for image analysis, regional CBF deficits in the pre-cuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus were detected in a sample of HF sufferers relative to controls. The regional distribution of functional deficits in the latter study was similar to that found in many positron emission tomography (PET) investigations of glucose metabolism at early AD stages, as well as in recent PET investigations of amyloid deposition in AD. Discussion: Imaging studies have rarely investigated whether there are localized functional brain deficits in association with HF. Recent regional CBF SPECT data provide preliminary anatomic support to a view that AD-like brain changes may develop in HF patients, possibly as a consequence of chronic CBF reductions. Additional studies of larger HF samples are needed to confirm this possibility, preferably using PET measures that have afforded greater sensitivity and specificity to identify brain functional abnormalities associated with the diagnosis of AD, such as indices of glucose metabolism and amyloid deposition.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "8cba9bd0f67116c2696e88b402e02e3dda5eb621", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/ijpr/QinHWX20", "MAG": "2980279331", "DOI": "10.1080/00207543.2019.1671626", "CorpusId": 208846427}, "title": "The value of advance payment financing to carbon emission reduction and production in a supply chain with game theory analysis", "abstract": "This paper investigates the value of advance payment financing to carbon emission reduction and production in a supply chain.

In the first category are studies focused on the addition of small amounts of gaseous fuel to CI engines. In these studies, gaseous fuel is regarded as a secondary fuel and diesel fuel is regarded as the main fuel for combustion. The objectives of these studies typically involve reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions by using gaseous fuel as a partial substitution for diesel fuel. However, the addition of gaseous fuel raises the combustion temperature, which increases emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). In the second category are studies focused on reactivity-controlled compression-ignition (RCCI) combustion. RCCI combustion can be implemented by early diesel injection with a large amount of low-reactivity fuel such as gasoline or gaseous fuel. Although RCCI combustion promises lower NOx and PM emissions and higher thermal efficiency than conventional diesel combustion, it requires a higher intake pressure (usually more than 1.7 bars) to maintain a lean fuel mixture. Therefore, in this study, practical applications of dual-fuel combustion with a low air-fuel ratio (AFR), which implies a low intake pressure, were systemically evaluated using propane in a diesel engine. The characteristics of dualfuel combustion for high and low AFRs were first evaluated. The proportion of propane used for four different operating conditions was then increased to decrease emissions and to identify the optimal condition for dual-fuel combustion. Although the four operating conditions differ, the AFR was maintained at 20 (\u03d5 approximately equal to 0.72) and the 50% mass fraction burned (MFB 50) was also fixed.

The voluntary goals to limit Brazilian GHG emissions pledged a reduction in between 36.1% and 38.9% of GHG emissions projected to 2020, to be 6\u201310% lower than in 2005. Brazil is in a good position to meet the voluntary mitigation goals pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) up to 2020: recent efforts to reduce deforestation have been successful and avoided deforestation will form the bulk of the emissions reduction commitment. In 2020, if governmental mitigation goals are met, then GHG emissions from the energy system would become the largest in the country. After 2020, if no additional mitigation actions are implemented, GHG emissions will increase again in the period 2020\u20132030, due to population and economic growth driving energy demand, supply and GHG emissions. However, Brazil is in a strong position to take a lead in low-carbon economic and social development due to its huge endowment of renewable energy resources allowing for additional mitigation actions to be adopted after 2020. Policy relevance The period beyond 2020 is now relevant in climate policy due to the Durban Platform agreeing a \u2018protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force\u2019 that will have effect from 2020. After 2020, Brazil will be in a situation more similar to other industrialized countries, faced with a new challenge of economic development with low GHG energy-related emissions, requiring the adoption of mitigation policies and measures targeted at the energy system. Unlike the mitigation actions in the land-use change sector, where most of the funding will come from the national budgets due to sovereignty concerns, the huge financial resources needed to develop low-carbon transport and energy infrastructure could benefit from soft loans channelled to the country through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs).", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "3af474c3570455ec7d3c682048f96a127bd2a80f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1598207957", "DOI": "10.2136/SSSABOOKSER5.3.C5", "CorpusId": 93760383}, "title": "Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry", "abstract": "The application of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to the analysis of soil and biological materials was reviewed in 1982 for this book series (Soltanpour et aI., 1982).

They were compared with 20 normal subjects and 12 subjects with head injury, but without tinnitus, who had similar audiometric thresholds.

RESULTS A significantly higher prevalence of SOAEs (100%), higher TEOAE response amplitudes, and reduced medial olivocochlear suppression in patients with tinnitus in comparison with subjects without tinnitus have been found.

Five policy instruments - carbon taxes, fossil fuel taxes, non-carbon (renewable) energy subsidies, a portfolio standard for the carbon intensity of energy production, and a portfolio standard for the use of non-carbon (renewable) energy resources - are compared in terms of costs, efficiency and their impact on the composition of the energy supply system.

We measured CB1 receptors in alcohol dependent patients in early and protracted abstinence, and in comparison with control subjects without alcohol use disorders, using positron emission tomography and [18F]FMPEP-d2, a radioligand for CB1 receptors. We scanned 18 male in-patients with alcohol dependence twice, within 3\u20137 days of admission from ongoing drinking, and after 2\u20134 weeks of supervised abstinence. Imaging data were compared with those from 19 age-matched healthy male control subjects. Data were also analyzed for potential influence of a common functional variation (rs2023239) in the CB1 receptor gene (CNR1) that may moderate CB1 receptor density. On the first scan, CB1 receptor binding was 20\u201330% lower in patients with alcohol dependence than in control subjects in all brain regions and was negatively correlated with years of alcohol abuse. After 2\u20134 weeks of abstinence, CB1 receptor binding remained similarly reduced in these patients. Irrespective of the diagnostic status, C allele carriers at rs2023239 had higher CB1 receptor binding compared with non-carriers. Alcohol dependence is associated with a widespread reduction of cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding in the human brain and this reduction persists at least 2\u20134 weeks into abstinence. The correlation of reduced binding with years of alcohol abuse suggests an involvement of CB1 receptors in alcohol dependence in humans.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "58720c6100125b7c06da430ae33b2d0c5e318bae", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5011411", "MAG": "2077813744", "DOI": "10.3382/ps.2013-03390", "CorpusId": 7984307, "PubMed": "24570445"}, "title": "Comparison of the environmental footprint of the egg industry in the United States in 1960 and 20101", "abstract": "The US egg industry has evolved considerably over recent decades by incorporating new technologies and production practices. To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the resource demand and environmental effects of these changes. This study quantifies the environmental footprint of egg production supply chains in the United States for 2010 compared with 1960 using life cycle assessment. The analysis considers changes in both foreground (e.g., hen production performance) and background (e.g., efficiencies of energy provision, fertilizer production, production of feed inputs, and transport modes) system variables. The results revealed that feed efficiency, feed composition, and manure management are the 3 primary factors that determine the environmental impacts of US egg production. Further research and improvements in these areas will aid in continual reduction of the environmental footprint of the US egg industry over time. Per kilogram of eggs produced, the environmental footprint for 2010 is 65% lower in acidifying emissions, 71% lower in eutrophying emissions, 71% lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 31% lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Table egg production was 30% higher in 2010; however, the total environmental footprint was 54% lower in acidifying emissions, 63% lower in eutrophying emissions, 63% lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 13% lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Reductions in the environmental footprint over the 50-yr interval considered can be attributed to the following: 27 to 30% due to improved efficiencies of background systems, which outweighed the declining energy return on energy invested for primary energy sources; 30 to 44% due to changes in feed composition; and 28 to 43% due to improved bird performance.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e7ce8c6b330ce0ff31d51e3ab78ed6832e9ae64a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2162197976", "DOI": "10.1021/ES0523845", "CorpusId": 2987070, "PubMed": "16786698"}, "title": "The global atmospheric environment for the next generation.", "abstract": "Air quality, ecosystem exposure to nitrogen deposition, and climate change are intimately coupled problems: we assess changes in the global atmospheric environment between 2000 and 2030 using 26 state-of-the-art global atmospheric chemistry models and three different emissions scenarios. The first (CLE) scenario reflects implementation of current air quality legislation around the world, while the second (MFR) represents a more optimistic case in which all currently feasible technologies are applied to achieve maximum emission reductions. We contrast these scenarios with the more pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. Ensemble simulations for the year 2000 are consistent among models and show a reasonable agreement with surface ozone, wet deposition, and NO2 satellite observations. Large parts of the world are currently exposed to high ozone concentrations and high deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems. By 2030, global surface ozone is calculated to increase globally by 1.5 +/- 1.2 ppb (CLE) and 4.3 +/- 2.2 ppb (A2), using the ensemble mean model results and associated +/-1 sigma standard deviations. Only the progressive MFR scenario will reduce ozone, by -2.3 +/- 1.1 ppb. Climate change is expected to modify surface ozone by -0.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, with larger decreases over sea than over land. Radiative forcing by ozone increases by 63 +/- 15 and 155 +/- 37 mW m(-2) for CLE and A2, respectively, and decreases by -45 +/- 15 mW m(-2) for MFR. We compute that at present 10.1% of the global natural terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to nitrogen deposition above a critical load of 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1). These percentages increase by 2030 to 15.8% (CLE), 10.5% (MFR), and 25% (A2). This study shows the importance of enforcing current worldwide air quality legislation and the major benefits of going further. Nonattainment of these air quality policy objectives, such as expressed by the SRES-A2 scenario, would further degrade the global atmospheric environment.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "dff437f38e4fc7171ea8431b55b70cf7124e8441", "externalIds": {"MAG": "235451397", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2015.05.005", "CorpusId": 150761656}, "title": "A comprehensive analysis of China's regional energy saving and emission reduction efficiency: From production and treatment perspectives", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c67661e4c4bb2e0ab196e5d5a6239f37e603684a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3002937892", "CorpusId": 154852413}, "title": "The Impact of Climate Policy on US Aviation", "abstract": "We use an economy-wide model to estimate the impact of a representative climate policy on fuel prices and economic activity, and a partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry to estimate changes in aviation carbon dioxide emissions and operations.
