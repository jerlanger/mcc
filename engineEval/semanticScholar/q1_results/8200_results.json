Agro-environmental policy approaches also differ, with emphasis on voluntary or incentive-based schemes in the United States versus a more regulatory approach in the European Union. This paper explores the implications of these differences for attaining long-term policy targets for air and water quality. Nutrient surplus problems were more severe in the European Union than in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. The EU Nitrates and National Emission Ceilings directives contributed to decreases in fertilizer use, N surplus, and ammonia (NH) emissions, whereas in the United States they stabilized, although NH emissions are still increasing. These differences were analyzed using statistical data for 1900-2005 and the global IMAGE model. IMAGE could reproduce NH emissions and soil N surpluses at different scales (European Union and United States, country and state) and N loads in the Rhine and Mississippi. The regulation-driven changes during the past 25 yr in the European Union have reduced public concerns and have brought agricultural N loads to the aquatic environment closer to US levels. Despite differences in agro-environmental policies and agricultural structure (more N-fixing soybean and more spatially separated feed and livestock production in the United States than in the European Union), current N use efficiency in US and EU crop production is similar. IMAGE projections for the IAASTD-baseline scenario indicate that N loading to the environment in 2050 will be similar to current levels. In the United States, environmental N loads will remain substantially smaller than in the European Union, whereas agricultural production in 2050 in the United States will increase by 30% relative to 2005, as compared with an increase of 8% in the European Union. However, in the United States, even rigorous mitigation with maximum recycling of manure N and a 25% reduction in fertilizer use will not achieve the policy target to halve the N export to the Gulf of Mexico.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6dc786b6755b64ac6c45875cbcc26fcc57c46e39", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2051378617", "DOI": "10.1515/REVEH.2002.17.2.135", "CorpusId": 36137834, "PubMed": "12222739"}, "title": "Human Health Risks of Dioxins for Populations Living Near Modern Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators", "abstract": "Although incineration is an effective way of treating municipal solid waste (MSW), in many countries the potential health risks associated with stack emissions, particularly those of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), have become a cause of great controversy and concern.

We assessed whether the pronounced reductions in the atmospheric PCDD/PCDFs emissions parallel the concurrent decreases in environmental matrices collected in the vicinity of the MSWIs. In comparison with other PCDD/PCDFs emission sources in the areas under direct influence of the MSWIs, the health risks from current emissions of PCDD/PCDFs by these incinerators would be of low significance for populations living in the neighborhood.

This modified version of KIVA-II was then used to model an air-cell equipped diesel engine for four different air-cell configurations. Of the four air-cell configurations simulated, one proved successful in reducing the predicted engine emissions by more than a factor of two while simultaneously reducing NOx by a slight amount, thus moving the engine off its particulate-NOx tradeoff curve defined by varying the fuel injection timing.

By helping to cluster development at station nodes and along rail corridors, investments in rail mass transit will discourage low-density suburban sprawl, promote open-space preservation, reduce development pressures on the natural environment, and make better use of existing infrastructure -- thereby lowering total public service costs. Moreover, to the extent that residents of such station area villages substitute transit use for auto use, vehicle emissions and traffic congestion will also be reduced. Because congestion and auto-based emissions reductions are key goals of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, numerous agencies charged with implementing these two acts are seriously considering programs that emphasize rail mass transit construction and the coordinated development of urban or transit villages.", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "5352823acbb7247e4e691b335ad63d369746d6ed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2032556756", "DOI": "10.1088/0957-4484/21/42/425102", "CorpusId": 23704092, "PubMed": "20858930"}, "title": "Therapeutic application of metallic nanoparticles combined with particle-induced x-ray emission effect.", "abstract": "Metallic nanoparticles (MNP) are able to release localized x-rays when activated with a high energy proton beam by the particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) effect.

An in vivo study in CT26 mouse tumor models with tumor regression assay demonstrated significant tumor dose enhancement, thought to be a result of the PIXE effect when compared to conventional PT without MNP (radiation-only group) using a 45 MeV proton beam (p < 0.02). Those receiving GNP or SNP injection doses of 300 mg kg(-1) body weight before proton beam therapy demonstrated 90% or 75% tumor volume reduction (TVR) in 20 days post-PT while the radiation-only group showed only 18% TVR and re-growth of tumor volume after 20 days.

Multiple linear regression is used to model interannual variation in snow cover duration as a function of winter mean daily temperature and monthly precipitation. Snow cover duration is closely linked to temperature, while precipitation contributes a positive effect among winters of similar temperature mode. Snow cover duration at mid to upper altitudes (600\u2013900 m) responds most strongly to variation in mean daily temperature. A 1 \u00b0C rise in temperature at the station corresponds to a 15-day reduction in snow cover at 130 m and a 33-day reduction at 750 m. The empirical relationship is applied to climate change scenarios from the HadRM3 regional climate model. Under a \u2018low\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions scenario, snow cover in the 2050s is projected to be reduced by 93% at 130 m, 43% at 600 m and 21% at 1060 m, while under a \u2018high\u2019 emissions scenario these reductions are projected to be 100%, 68%, and 32%, respectively.

In response to this new information, some firms have dramatically reduced toxic chemical emissions. This paper explores the factors that both explain differences across firms in their initial toxic emission levels and in the reductions beyond any legally required levels subsequent to the availability of public information on TRI. The underlying theory is that firm-level pollution varies because of firm-specific factors that affect both the \"ability\" and \"incentive\" for firms to reduce pollution. In comparing emission levels between 1989 and 1992, we find that the largest firms are most likely to reduce emissions subsequent to this new information being made public.

This paper focuses on modeling GCM and scenario uncertainty using possibility theory in projecting streamflow of Mahanadi river, at Hirakud, India. A downscaling method based on fuzzy clustering and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is applied to project monsoon streamflow from three GCMs with two green house emission scenarios. Possibilities are assigned to all the GCMs with scenarios based on their performance in modeling the streamflow of the recent past (1991\u20132005), when there are signals of climate forcing. The possibilities associated with different GCMs and scenarios are used as weights in computing the possibilistic mean of the CDFs projected for three standard time slices 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The result shows that the value of streamflow at which the CDF reaches 1 reduces with time, which shows the reduction in probability of occurrence of extreme high flow events in future. Historic record of monsoon streamflow of Mahanadi river also shows similar decreasing trend, which may be due to the effect of high surface warming. Reduction in Mahandai streamflow is likely to pose a major challenge for water resources engineers in meeting water demands in future.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "8fc6eab735c6edfa2841d3bf758b451486f8b83a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2330583388", "CorpusId": 101504353}, "title": "Critical loads of acidity to surface waters: An empirical diatom-based palaeolimnological model", "abstract": "Attempts to reverse surface water acidification over large areas of Europe and North America require major reductions in the emission of sulfur dioxide from fossil-fuel combustion plants.

In this approach sulfur dioxide reductions are calculated according to the need to reduce acid deposition at sensitive acidified sites to below a threshold, or critical load, where ecological ''damage'' should not occur (1, 2), Using our large dataset of inferred acidification profiles from dated lake sediment cores throughout the UK (3-5), we have developed an empirical model based on a dose-response function that can be used to set critical load values for a site from a knowledge of the ratio of Ca++ of the water (sensitivity) to modelled S deposition (loading) at the site. This diatom model is most suited to setting the baseline critical load for a site as, in theory, it identifies the first point of biological change in the acidification of an aquatic ecosystem and, unlike the steady-state water chemistry model, it is not dependent on the fixing of a threshold ANC value for a waterbody.

Using projections for US travel to 2050 and experience from Europe (as well as US focused projects) of diversion to HSR, we consider the proposed plans for HSR in the US and account for changes in vehicles, fuels, CO2 emissions from travel, and demand levels for the competing auto and air modes through 2050 under two alternative projections of future travel conditions and levels. One scenario assumes trends-extended and a second assumes a \"green revolution\" with considerably lower levels of travel and emissions. We conclude that under either scenario, HSR would likely lead to a small (~1%) reduction of CO2 emissions in the transportation sector compared with the original projections without HSR.

However, emissions of ammonia, surpluses of nitrogen and phosphorus, and use of pesticides per hectare of agricultural land are also among the highest in the EU. In spite of successful policies and farm measures to reduce this pollution, agriculture still constitutes the largest environmental pressure on biodiversity. Dutch agriculture, including horticulture, also contributes 14% (32 Mton CO2-eq in 2016) to the national emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG). These emissions hardly decreased since 2000. In the current bid to meet the Paris Climate Agreement (PCA), the agricultural sector will need to reduce emission by 3.5 Mton in 2030. The relative reduction target for GHG by agriculture is 11% and less than the national target of 49%, but still is a challenge because the technical potential for reduction of methane and nitrous oxides is relatively small. Apart from technical measures and innovations, there is an increasing call in society for structural measures, like reduction of livestock, to assure an appropriate reduction of GHG emission from agriculture. However there are also concerns about leakage effects when livestock production would increase elsewhere, e.g.in the EU, causing a net increase of GHG emission and increased local environmental pollution. We carried out a Life Cycle Analysis for production of milk, pork, poultry, potato and wheat in other EU countries which disclosed that GHG emission per unit of product in the Netherlands is similar to that in Germany and France, while lower than in central and southern EU. Nitrogen and phosphorus surplus per unit of product for Dutch products often are higher due to the high use of manure. These results indicate that the risk of transboundary leakage effects likely are small when implementing PCA for agriculture in the Netherlands or stricter environmental policies, also when including reduction of livestock production.

Using a novel environmental chamber method, we have, for the first time to our knowledge, quantified the aging and variation in the optical properties of BC particles under ambient urban conditions representative of developed and developing countries. Our results indicate that BC under polluted urban environments could contribute significantly to both pollution development and large positive radiative forcing, implying that reduction of BC emissions under polluted environments achieves a cobenefit in simultaneously controlling air pollution and protecting climate, especially for developing countries. Black carbon (BC) exerts profound impacts on air quality and climate because of its high absorption cross-section over a broad range of electromagnetic spectra, but the current results on absorption enhancement of BC particles during atmospheric aging remain conflicting. Here, we quantified the aging and variation in the optical properties of BC particles under ambient conditions in Beijing, China, and Houston, United States, using a novel environmental chamber approach. BC aging exhibits two distinct stages, i.e., initial transformation from a fractal to spherical morphology with little absorption variation and subsequent growth of fully compact particles with a large absorption enhancement. The timescales to achieve complete morphology modification and an absorption amplification factor of 2.4 for BC particles are estimated to be 2.3 h and 4.6 h, respectively, in Beijing, compared with 9 h and 18 h, respectively, in Houston. Our findings indicate that BC under polluted urban environments could play an essential role in pollution development and contribute importantly to large positive radiative forcing. The variation in direct radiative forcing is dependent on the rate and timescale of BC aging, with a clear distinction between urban cities in developed and developing countries, i.e., a higher climatic impact in more polluted environments.

The work is based on a Westport HPDI fuelling system, which provides direct injection of both natural gas and liquid diesel into the combustion chamber of an otherwise unmodified diesel engine. The diesel acts as a pilot to ignite the natural gas, which normally burns in a non-premixed fashion, leading to significant PM formation. The concepts to reduce PM evaluated in this work are: 1) adjusting the relative phasing of the natural gas and diesel injections to allow more premixing of the natural gas prior to ignition; 2) reducing the pilot quantity to increase the ignition delay of the gas jet; and 3) reducing the level of EGR at select modes to reduce PM formation. These strategies are evaluated at steady state using single- and multi-cylinder research engines, supported by CFD analysis. The results demonstrate that allowing limited premixing of the gas jet prior to ignition can significantly reduce PM emissions. Excessive premixing can lead to high rates of pressure rise; EGR can be used to moderate the combustion under these conditions, without causing increased PM emissions. Reducing pilot quantity is another effective technique to reduce PM, primarily by allowing more air to mix with the gas jet before ignition. These various techniques can be combined to form a new operating strategy that significantly reduces engine-out PM and NOx emissions compared to the baseline strategy without significantly impacting fuel consumption.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "b7300d1cf7acce63936b49f018b372e57764907c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978327736", "DOI": "10.1115/DSCC2011-5981", "CorpusId": 109207485}, "title": "Integrated powertrain control to meet low CO2 emissions for a hybrid distribution truck with scr-denox system", "abstract": "This article presents a cost-based optimization strategy that explicitly deals with the requirements for fuel consumption and emissions.

Our range of results indicates that these fuel switches have the potential to produce climate benefits on all time frames, but combinations of significant well-to-wheels methane emissions reductions and natural gas vehicle efficiency improvements would be required.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "92ca7446b9481ae1cf88811dec9cd756baabd762", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1965659300", "DOI": "10.1086/165886", "CorpusId": 120997331}, "title": "Detailed study of the emission lines in the Seyfert 1 nucleus of M81", "abstract": "Optical spectra of M81 having moderate resolution and exceptionally high SNR ratios are reported.

The results showed a strong decoupling during the period of 2010\u20132012, which is considered as the best development situation. In 1994\u20132010 SA had a weak decoupling; while during the period 1990\u20131994, the development in SA presented an expansive negative decoupling state. The comparison of the OECD and Tapio\u2019s methods showed well-correlated results but differed in their applications; however, the OECD method appeared as the simpler one. The results of Kaya identity demonstrated that the increase in population, GDP per capita and deteriorating energy efficiency were the main primary driving forces for the increase of CO2 emissions.

In this paper, we present a new method for segmenting transmission images in whole-body scanning. This reduces the noise in the correction maps while still correcting for differing attenuation coefficients of specific tissues. Based on the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm, the method segments the PET transmission images into a given number of clusters to extract specific areas of differing attenuation such as air, the lungs and soft tissue, preceded by a median filtering procedure. The reconstructed transmission image voxels are, therefore, segmented into populations of uniform attenuation based on knowledge of the human anatomy. The clustering procedure starts with an overspecified number of clusters followed by a merging process to group clusters with similar properties (redundant clusters) and removal of some undesired substructures using anatomical knowledge. The method is unsupervised, adaptive and allows the classification of both pre- or post-injection transmission images obtained using either coincident 68Ge or single-photon 137Cs sources into main tissue components in terms of attenuation coefficients. A high-quality transmission image of the scanner bed is obtained from a high statistics scan and added to the transmission image. The segmented transmission images are then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors to be used for the reconstruction of the corresponding emission scan. The technique has been tested on a chest phantom simulating the lungs, heart cavity and the spine, the Rando-Alderson phantom, and whole-body clinical PET studies showing a remarkable improvement in image quality, a clear reduction of noise propagation from transmission into emission data allowing for reduction of transmission scan duration. There was very good correlation (R2 = 0.96) between maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) in lung nodules measured on images reconstructed with measured and segmented attenuation correction with a statistically significant decrease in SUV (17.03% +/- 8.4%, P < 0.01) on the latter images, whereas no proof of statistically significant differences on the average SUVs was observed.

Meanwhile, decreases in U.S. emissions lead to a warming of +0.48 (\u00b10.03)/+0.46 (\u00b10.03) W/m2 in western United States and +1.41 (\u00b10.07)/+1.32 (\u00b10.09) W/m2 in eastern United States through changes in aerosol direct radiative forcing. Increases in emissions from East Asia generally have a modest impact on U.S. air quality but mitigated the warming effect induced by reductions in U.S. emissions by 25% in western United States and 7% in eastern United States. As U.S. domestic aerosol and precursor emissions continue to decrease, foreign emissions may become increasingly important to radiative forcing over the United States.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3c00912f3ae37dc5be119e34c164424f2ec585c9", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 25328979, "PubMed": "11583428"}, "title": "Dietary adipic acid reduces ammonia emission from swine excreta.", "abstract": "Adipic acid is only partially catabolized when it is fed to animals, and a portion of it is excreted in urine.

In Exp. 1, nursery pigs (n = 14) were fed (for a period of 7 d) either a standard nursery diet or the same diet supplemented with 1% adipic acid to assess effects on urinary pH (collected on d 5 or 6) and in vitro ammonia emission from the collected urine samples that were mixed with control feces. In Exp. 2, grower pigs housed 10 each in one of two chambers were fed a control diet or the same diet supplemented with 1% adipic acid. Ventilated air was quantified and analyzed for ammonia using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to determine the effects of feeding 1% adipic acid on ammonia emission. The results from Exp. 1 showed that adipic acid strongly reduced urinary pH (from 7.7 to 5.5, P < 0.05). In vitro ammonia emission from these urine samples was significantly reduced at all the time points evaluated (1, 3, 18, and 46 h with reductions of 94, 93, 70, and 39%, respectively, P < 0.05). Experiment 2 showed that adipic acid supplementation reduced ammonia emission by 25% (P < 0.05), which corresponded to the predicted reduction in ammonia emission based on the reduction in manure pH observed. In conclusion, feeding adipic acid lowers urinary pH and reduces ammonia emission. The reduction in ammonia emission, though, does not correspond to the reduction in urinary pH but corresponds to the reduction in fecal pH as a result of mixing the urine and feces, in which feces act as a strong buffer.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "90168a7f460ff1cc9a53fc2e60965abd2e9dd7a9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044187965", "DOI": "10.1071/SR14129", "CorpusId": 129797049}, "title": "Nitrous oxide emission from two acidic soils as affected by dolomite application", "abstract": "The effect of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) application on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was examined in a laboratory study with soil from a rice paddy\u2013rapeseed rotation (PR soil, pH 5.25) and from a rice paddy\u2013fallow\u2013flooded rotation soil (PF soil, pH 5.52).

This is\u00a0part of a\u00a0research study addressing the potential co-benefits associated with selected black carbon (BC) emission reduction measures on mitigation of air pollution and climate forcing in Southeast Asia (SEA). This paper presents details of emission inventory (EI) results and WRF\u2013CHIMERE model performance evaluation. The SEA regional emissions for 2007 were updated with our EI results for Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia and used for the model input. WRF\u2013CHIMERE-simulated 2007 PM10, PM2.5, and BC over the SEA domain (0.25\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u00b0) and the results were evaluated against the available meteorology and air quality monitoring data in the domain. WRF hourly simulation results were evaluated using the observed data at eight\u00a0international airport stations in five SEA countries and showed a\u00a0satisfactory performance. WRF\u2013CHIMERE results for PM10 and PM2.5 showed strong seasonal influence of biomass open burning while the BC distribution showed the influence of urban activities in big SEA cities. Daily average PM10 constructed from the hourly concentrations were obtained from the automatic monitoring stations in three large SEA cities, i.e., Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Surabaya, for model evaluation. The daily observed PM2.5 and BC concentrations obtained from the Improving Air Quality in Asian Developing Countries (AIRPET) project for four\u00a0cities (i.e., Bangkok, Hanoi, Bandung, and Manila) were also used for model evaluation. In addition, hourly BC concentrations were taken from the measurement results of the Asian Pacific Network (APN) project at a\u00a0suburban site in Bangkok. The modeled PM10 and BC satisfactorily met all suggested statistical criteria for PM evaluation. The modeled PM2.5\u2215PM10\u00a0ratios estimated for four AIRPET sites ranged between 0.47 and 0.59, lower than observed values of 0.6\u20130.83.

Despite detailed modelling undertaken by the Commonwealth Treasury, there is widespread speculation about the possible economic impact of a carbon tax in Australia. In this paper we build a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model incorporating many new features to deal with the issue of emissions and model the impact of carbon taxes. The analysis undertaken by simulating the impact of a carbon tax of $23 a tonne reveals some interesting outcomes. For example, in the short run, Australia\u2019s real GDP may decline by 0.68 percent, consumer prices may rise by 0.75 percent, and the price of electricity may increase by about 26 percent as a result of the tax. Nevertheless it allows Australia to make a substantial cut in its CO2 emissions. The simulation results imply an emission reduction of about 12 percent in its first year of operation. The tax burden is unequally distributed among different household groups with low-income households carrying a relatively higher burden. __________________________________________ *The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council under Discovery project DP0986306.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "32d132528c04ec2b08a31e6658d288c67b7b80b6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1924568039", "DOI": "10.1029/2009GB003615", "CorpusId": 52239711}, "title": "Can N2O stable isotopes and isotopomers be useful tools to characterize sources and microbial pathways of N2O production and consumption in tropical soils?", "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas in which the main sources are tropical rainforest and agricultural soils.

SCL decisions traditionally have been based upon minimization of total logistics costs (inventory plus transportation). The paper aims to answer the following research question: given the environmental implications of vehicle emissions as a function of load weight, are the familiar SCL policies still optimal?Design/methodology/approach - Nonlinear expressions relating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to vehicle weight, and parameterized by trip length and average travel speed, were derived from published experimental data. Those expressions were included in a simulation model that assessed the environmental impact, in addition to the logistics cost, of the policies concerning when to release a consolidated load.Findings - For short holding times, the quantity policy performs best in terms of both logistics cost and pollution reduction. In the case of low-order arrival rates and long holding times, the time policy is best at reducing emissions and logistics costs. However, the best dispatch policy conflicts in terms of pollution reduction and logistics cost minimization for the following cases: moderate holding times and long holding times combined with high-order arrival rates. In these cases, it is necessary to consider the speed of travel, trip length and unit cost of emissions when evaluating the policies.Research limitations/implications - A carbon trading market appears to be on the horizon in several industries, which will establish a price per unit weight for CO2 emissions and make it beneficial to minimize the total cost (including emissions) of the network. This research only considers CO2 pollution, but future investigations could also consider other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic carbons.Practical implications - SCL policies can include a \u201cgreen logistics\u201d component that is based on empirical data.

Tailpipe NO x emissions from a modified European production level 1.8L diesel Ford Focus TDCi were reduced to the range of ULEVII levels (0.05 g/mi NO x ) with a green catalyst system. The green system also had results within the Tier 2 SFTP US06 standard (0.14 g/mi NMHC+NO x ). An oxidation catalyst was used to convert engine-out HC and CO upstream of the urea SCR system. Aqueous urea was added to the exhaust using a Ford-developed air-assisted injection system. A base metal/zeolite SCR catalyst utilized the added reductant to convert NOx to N 2 under lean conditions.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "56e3c4c246827c796fe00ffdef63d3a3fcf29fb6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986642277", "DOI": "10.1007/s10705-014-9620-2", "CorpusId": 19019067}, "title": "Gas emissions from liquid dairy manure: complete versus partial storage emptying", "abstract": "AbstractWhen manure slurry is removed from storages for land application, there is often \u2018aged\u2019 manure that remains because the storages are not completely emptied. Aged manure may act as an inoculum and alter subsequent methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emissions when fresh manure is added to the system, compared to an empty storage that is filled with fresh manure. Completely emptying manure storages may be a practice to decrease gas emissions, however, little pilot-scale research has been conducted to directly quantify the inoculum effect. Therefore, we compared CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions from three pilot-scale slurry tanks (~10.5\u00a0m3 each) filled with a mixture of fresh manure and an inoculum of previously stored manure (i.e., partial emptying) to three tanks that contained only fresh manure (i.e., complete emptying). Gas fluxes were continuously measured over 155\u00a0d of warm season storage using flow-through steady-state chambers. The absence of an inoculum significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 56\u00a0% compared to partially emptied (inoculated) tanks, while there was no difference in N2O emissions. There was a significant 49\u00a0% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because the overall budget (as CO2-eq) was dominated by CH4. Complete manure storage emptying could be an effective GHG mitigation strategy; however, NH3 emissions were significantly higher from un-inoculated tanks due to slower crust formation. Therefore additional NH3 abatement should be considered.\n", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "bbb43b8108a12e088cdbfb242c7fdddc7a1b2e9e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042156944", "DOI": "10.1364/OE.21.014962", "CorpusId": 16710035, "PubMed": "23787684"}, "title": "Hyperbolic and plasmonic properties of silicon/Ag aligned nanowire arrays.", "abstract": "The hyperbolic and plasmonic properties of silicon nanowire/Ag arrays have been investigated.

The aim is to study the polarization of thermal dust emission to see if the alignment of the grain by radiative torques could explain the observed relation between the degree of polarization and intensity. Predictions are made for polarimetry observations with the Planck satellite. Methods. Our results are based on model clouds derived from MHD simulations of magnetized turbulent flows. The continuum radiative transfer problem is solved with Monte Carlo methods to estimate the three-dimensional distribution of dust emission and the radiation field strength affecting the grain alignment. The minimum grain size aligned by the radiative torques is calculated, and the Rayleigh polarization reduction factor, R , is derived for different grain size distributions. We show maps of polarized thermal dust emission that are predicted by the models. The relation between the intensity and polarization degree is examined in self-gravitating cores. Furthermore, we study the effects of wavelength, resolution, and observational noise. Results. We are able to reproduce the P/I-relation with the grain alignment by radiative torques. The decrease in intrinsic polarization and total emission means that sub-mm polarimetry carries only a little information about the magnetic fields in dense cores with high visual extinction. The interpretation of the observations will be further complicated by the unknown magnetic field geometry and the fact that what is observed as cores may, in fact, be a superposition of several density enhancements.

The dynamic model MAGIC was applied to 25 lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada using a regional modelling methodology. Soil and lake water chemistry for each lake catchment was simulated for the period 1850\u20132050. Sulphate (SO 4 2\u2013 ) deposition forecasts were derived from recently proposed emission reductions, which correspond roughly to a 50% reduction in SO 4 2\u2013 deposition by 2010 from the 2000 baseline. Changes in SO 4 2\u2013 deposition had a significant impact on lake chemistry. Simulated lake water chemistry showed a recovery potential under the current deposition scenario; by 2050 concentration levels recovered to values predicted for the early 1900s. Moreover, simulated future lake water chemistry showed significant recovery compared to 1975 levels. However, although regional simulations predict that base cation losses have decreased in recent years, soils in the region will continue to acidify with Ca 2+ losses dominating depletion of the exchangeable pool. Base cation losses from the exchangeable pool are currently buffering lakes against the impacts of acid deposition; ultimately base cation inputs into the lakes will decrease as exchangeable base cation pools become depleted. Further emission reductions are necessary to ensure continued recovery from acidification.

National annual total CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels are likely known to within 5\u201310\u202f% for most developed countries. However, uncertainties are inevitably larger (by unknown amounts) for emission estimates at regional and monthly scales, or for developing countries. Given recent international efforts to establish emission reduction targets, independent determination and verification of regional and national scale fossil fuel CO2 emissions are likely to become increasingly important. Here, we take advantage of the fact that precise measurements of 14C in CO2 provide a largely unbiased tracer for recently added fossil-fuel-derived CO2 in the atmosphere and present an atmospheric inversion technique to jointly assimilate observations of CO2 and 14CO2 in order to simultaneously estimate fossil fuel emissions and biospheric exchange fluxes of CO2. Using this method in a set of Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), we show that given the coverage of 14CO2 measurements available in 2010 (969 over North America, 1063 globally), we can recover the US national total fossil fuel emission to better than 1\u202f% for the year and to within 5\u202f% for most months. Increasing the number of 14CO2 observations to \u2009\u223c\u20095000 per year over North America, as recently recommended by the National Academy of Science (NAS) (Pacala et al., 2010), we recover monthly emissions to within 5\u202f% for all months for the US as a whole and also for smaller, highly emissive regions over which the specified data coverage is relatively dense, such as for the New England states or the NY-NJ-PA tri-state area. This result suggests that, given continued improvement in state-of-the art transport models, a measurement program similar in scale to that recommended by the NAS can provide for independent verification of bottom-up inventories of fossil fuel CO2 at the regional and national scale. In addition, we show that the dual tracer inversion framework can detect and minimize biases in estimates of the biospheric flux that would otherwise arise in a traditional CO2-only inversion when prescribing fixed but inaccurate fossil fuel fluxes.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "0168bd110f998b8ca2e164d96ec5b8b5ee3a5d62", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2963246151", "DOI": "10.1007/S11708-019-0640-0", "CorpusId": 199846879}, "title": "China\u2019s pre-2020 CO2 emission reduction potential and its influence", "abstract": "China achieved the reduction of CO2 intensity of GDP by 45% compared with 2005 at the end of 2017, realizing the commitment at 2009 Copenhagen Conference on emissions reduction 3 years ahead of time.

North American {O}_{3} fluxes into Europe experience a maximum in spring and summer, reflecting the seasonal variation in photochemical activity and in export pathways. In summer, North American {O}_{3} enters Europe at higher altitudes and lower latitudes because of deep convection, and because the flow over the North Atlantic is mostly zonal in that season. The low-level inflow is only important in spring, when loss rates in the boundary layer over the North Atlantic are weaker. Asian O3 arrives mainly via the westerlies, and usually at higher altitudes than North American O3 because of stronger deep convection over Asia. In addition, Asian O3 fluxes are at a maximum in summer during the monsoon period because of enhanced convection over Asia, increased nitrogen oxides sources from lightning and direct transport towards Europe via the monsoon easterlies.

These simulations accept boundary conditions from HadGEM2-ES runs in the two emissions scenarios. The possible consequences of regional climate change on vegetation properties, such as biomass, net primary production and changes in forest extent and distribution, were investigated. The Inland model projections show reductions in tropical forest cover in both scenarios. The reduction of tropical forest cover is greater in RCP8.5. The Inland model projects biomass increases where tropical forest remains due to the CO2 fertilization effect. The future distribution of predominant vegetation shows that some areas of tropical rainforest in Central America are replaced by savannah and grassland in RCP4.5. Inland projections under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show a net primary productivity reduction trend due to significant tropical forest reduction, temperature increase, precipitation reduction and dry spell increments, despite the biomass increases in some areas of Costa Rica and Panama. This study may provide guidance to adaptation studies of climate change impacts on the tropical rainforests in Central America.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "01dd829393d38f581567df4b94f25d8999aa558b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2150272114", "DOI": "10.4209/AAQR.2014.10.0268", "CorpusId": 55060756}, "title": "Microalgae Oil: Algae Cultivation and Harvest, Algae Residue Torrefaction and Diesel Engine Emissions Tests", "abstract": "Microalgae can be used as a biological photocatalyst to reduce the CO2 levels in the atmosphere, with the advantage of not competing with food crops for arable land, and thus offer a potential method for limiting climate change. Microalgae have also been proposed as a sustainable fuel source. This study investigated the microalgae harvest yields, the thermogravimetric behavior of both microalgae oil and microalgae residue, the torrefaction of microalgae residue, and diesel engine tests using diesel-microalgae biodiesel blends. The mean annual harvest rate of microalgae oil in open ponds was found to be 4355 kg per 10000 m 2 . Compared with conventional diesel, the fuel blends - B2 (2% microalgae biodiesel + 98% conventional diesel), B2-But20 (B2 + 20% Butanol) and B2-But20-W0.5 (B2-But20 + 0.5% water) showed a reduction of 22.0%, 57.2%, and 59.5% in PM emissions, and a decrease of 17.7%, 31.4% and 40.7% in BaPeq emissions, while B2-But20 and B2-But20-W0.5 had reduced NOx emissions, of approximately 25.0% and 28.2%, respectively, but B2 showed a 2.0% increase in NOx emissions. Conversely, the addition of water and butanol fractions in diesel increases HC and CO emissions, although these can be easily removed using tailpipe catalysts and absorbers. In addition, torrefaction of microalgae residue results in solid, liquid and gas products. This study is the first of its kind to report the liquid compositions from the torrefaction of microalgae residue. The condensate liquid products contained glucose molecules like 1,4:3,6-Dianhydro-\u03b1-d-glucopyranose, and furfural, limonene, pyridine, levoglucosan, and aziridine, among others. These compounds can be utilized as microalgae value added products, and applied in specialty industries as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or solvent raw materials. Briefly, microalgae not only offer benefits in reducing CO2 from the atmosphere or providing raw materials for biodiesel production, but microalgae residue can also be treated via torrefaction to produce biochar. Based on the results of this study, more research is recommended on the economic potential of using both solid and liquid products from microalgae torrefaction.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "17693719095ab46cb536b92b011d00aed9287105", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1966064920", "DOI": "10.1002/LITE.201200230", "CorpusId": 83799757}, "title": "Bio-based adipic acid from renewable oils", "abstract": "Adipic acid (hexanedioic acid, C6H10O4) is a high-volume dicarboxylic acid used as a chemical intermediate in the commercial manufacture of nylon 6,6, thermoplastic polyurethane resins, plasticizers, adhesives and synthetic lubricants, with an estimated global market worth approximately $6.3 billion. We report here the development of a robust industrial yeast strain and fermentation process for production of bio-based adipic acid at high yield and selectivity from any vegetable oil, regardless of its fatty acid composition.

This paper expands farmers\u2019 options and models their choices of tillage frequency. Less frequent tilling sequesters more carbon but permits a greater accumulation of weeds, whereas more frequent tilling eliminates weeds but releases carbon (tillage emissions). The timing of tillage balances its marginal benefits and costs. Higher payments from industry or government for atmospheric greenhouse gas reductions will increase marginal cost and reduce tillage frequency. Other key parameters, such as higher rates of tillage emissions or reduced weed impact, also influence tillage frequency. However, for the discount rate and the natural decay rate of carbon, the net change depends on the magnitude of other parameters.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "8918e855582fa138e47ce33f9bdd316fa01cc916", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2015853952", "DOI": "10.1057/PALGRAVE.IJME.9100038", "CorpusId": 54923769}, "title": "Climate Policy: Analysis of Ecological, Technical and Economic Implications for International Maritime Transport", "abstract": "In 1997, the 3rd conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the Kyoto Protocol as a consequence of increasing evidence of a manmade global warming of the atmosphere. Binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for industrialised countries were agreed upon. However, bunker fuel emissions from international shipping have so far been excluded from any commitment in the protocol. After looking at the magnitude of emissions from international shipping and likely trends, we make suggestions how shipping can be integrated into policies to control greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of policy instruments has to be the introduction of an effective and efficient stimulus for environmentally sound operational and technical improvements on existing and new ships. Consequently, the best solution would be for IMO to agree on a global shipping emissions target that would be comparable to targets of industrialised countries. However, for the time being, the introduction of a CDM type mechanism would be a promising step into the right direction.", "year": 2002}]}
