We report results from initial field assessments of six commercial ACS models from the states of Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh in India.

Implementing this scheme can also achieve minimal effects of carbon emissions limitation on the economy on the basis that the environment is not destroyed.

In particular, the observations showed higher methane concentrations in the tropics than previously assumed. Here, we analyze the SCIAMACHY observations and their implications for emission estimates in detail using a four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system. We focus on the period September to November 2003 and on the South American continent, for which the satellite observations showed the largest deviations from model simulations. In this set-up the advantages of the 4D-Var approach and the zooming capability of the underlying TM5 atmospheric transport model are fully exploited. After application of a latitude-dependent bias correction to the SCIAMACHY observations, the assimilation system is able to accurately fit those observations, while retaining consistency with a network of surface methane measurements. The main emission increments resulting from the inversion are an increase in the tropics, a decrease in South Asia, and a decrease at northern hemispheric high latitudes. The SCIAMACHY observations yield considerable additional emission uncertainty reduction, particularly in the (sub-)tropical regions, which are poorly constrained by the surface network. For tropical South America, the inversion suggests more than a doubling of emissions compared to the a priori during the 3 months considered. Extensive sensitivity experiments, in which key assumptions of the inversion set-up are varied, show that this finding is robust. Independent airborne observations in the Amazon basin support the presence of considerable local methane sources. However, these observations also indicate that emissions from eastern South America may be smaller than estimated from SCIAMACHY observations. In this respect it must be realized that the bias correction applied to the satellite observations does not take into account potential regional systematic errors, which - if identified in the future - will lead to shifts in the overall distribution of emission estimates.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "88c35ccaedea8d7979053ac14797fb7ee3f269f0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035080088", "DOI": "10.1111/twec.12051", "CorpusId": 54913421}, "title": "Subglobal Climate Agreements and Energy\u2010Intensive Activities: An Evaluation of Carbon Leakage in the Copper Industry", "abstract": "Subglobal climate policies induce changes in international competitiveness and favor a relocation of carbon-emitting activities to non-abating regions.

Clearing of tropical rainforest for pasture has the potential to alter N2O and NO emissions from soils by altering moisture, nitrogen supply or other factors that control N oxide production. In this review we report annual rates of N2O and NO emissions from forest and pastures of different ages in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia and examine how forest clearing alters the major controls of N oxide production. Forests had annual N2O emissions of 1.7 to 4.3\u00a0kg N ha-1 y-1 and annual NO emissions of 1.4\u00a0kg N ha-1 y-1. Young pastures of 1\u20133\u00a0years old had higher N2O emissions than the original forest (3.1\u20135.1\u00a0kg N ha-1 y-1) but older pastures of 6\u00a0years or more had lower emissions (0.1 to 0.4\u00a0kg N ha-1 y-1). Both soil moisture and indices of soil N cycling were relatively poor predictors of N2O, NO and combined N2O + NO emissions. In forest, high N2O emissions occurred at soil moistures above 30 water-filled pore space, while NO emissions occurred at all measured soil moistures (18\u201343). In pastures, low N availability led to low N2O and NO emissions across the entire range of soil moistures. Based on these patterns and results of field fertilization experiments, we concluded that: (1) nitrification was the source of NO from forest soils, (2) denitrification was not a major source of N2O production from forest soils or was not limited by NO- supply, (3) denitrification was a major source of N2O production from pasture soils but only when NO3- was available, and (4) nitrification was not a major source of 3 NO production in pasture soils. Pulse wettings after prolonged dry periods increased N2O and NO3- emissions for only short periods and not enough to appreciably affect annual emission rates. We project that Basin-wide, the effect of clearing for pasture in the future will be a small reduction in total N2O emissions if the extensive pastures of the Amazon continue to be managed in a way similar to current practices. In the future, both N2Oand NO fluxes could increase if uses of pastures change to include greater use of N fertilizers or N-fixing crops. Predicting the consequences of these changes for N oxide production will require an understanding of how the processes of nitrification and denitrification interact with soil type and regional moisture regimes to control N2O and NO production from these new anthropogenic N sources.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "959d3e69ad3daa5adab338dace56a1acfa142045", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2125934489", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1365-3040.1991.TB01522.X", "CorpusId": 86058970}, "title": "Studies of the relationship between isoprene emission rate and CO2 or photon\u2010flux density using a real\u2010time isoprene analyser", "abstract": "Abstract. Studies of the isoprene emission rate in response to changes in photon-flux density and CO2 partial pressure were conducted using a recently developed on-line isoprene analyser combined with a gas exchange system and chlorophyll fluorometer. Upon darkening, the isoprene emission rate from leaves of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) began to decline immediately, demonstrating that the internal pool of isoprene, or its precursors, is small and that the instantaneous emission rate is tightly coupled to the rate of synthesis. A post-illumination burst of isoprene was observed within 5 min after darkening and lasted for 15\u201320 min in four isoprene-emitting species that were examined. In leaves of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.), the magnitude of the post-illumination burst was dependent on the photon-flux density that existed before darkening, but not on ambient CO2 partial pressure. The dependence of the post-illumination burst on photon-flux density paralleled that for the steady-state rate of isoprene emission. A step-wise increase in intercellular CO2 partial pressure from 24.5 to 60 Pa resulted in an immediate decrease in isoprene emission rate and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching, but an increase in CO2 assimilation rate. Given the several recent studies that link isoprene emission to chloroplastic processes, the results of this study indicate that the linkage is not dependent on the rate of CO2 flux through the reductive pentose phosphate pathway, but rather on more complex relationships involving metabolites not appreciably influenced by CO2 partial pressure.", "year": 1991}, {"paperId": "d7d2474ecb4927637efbd7914bbd7f02242309bd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035252578", "DOI": "10.1097/00000542-199703000-00006", "CorpusId": 32673978, "PubMed": "9066320"}, "title": "Positron Emission Tomography Study of Regional Cerebral Metabolism in Humans during Isoflurane Anesthesia", "abstract": "Background Although the anesthetic effects of the intravenous anesthetic agent propofol have been studied in the living human brain using brain imaging technology, the nature of the anesthetic state evident in the human brain during inhalational anesthesia remains unknown.

This paper discusses the pros and cons of the approach, and provides an assessment of the approach with respect to leakage, non-permanence, forest degradation, uncertainties of baseline estimates, incentives to improve land use, and scale of credits. The paper also presents some suggested refi nements and addresses monitoring needs. Introduction Global deforestation and forest degradation rates have a signifi cant impact on the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere (Achard et al. 2002; Houghton 2003; Fearnside and Laurance 2004). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2001) estimated that during the 1990s 16.1 million ha per year were affected by deforestation, most of them in the tropics. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculated that for the same period the contribution of land-use changes to GHG accumulation into the atmosphere was 1.6\u00b10.8 Giga (1 G = 10) tonnes of carbon per year (Prentice et al. 2001), a quantity that corresponds to 25% of the total annual global emissions of GHGs. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in recognizing climate change as a serious threat, urged countries to take up measures to enhance and conserve ecosystems such as forests that act as reservoirs and sinks of GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol (KP), adopted in 1997, complements the UNFCCC by providing an enforceable agreement with quantitative targets for reducing GHG emissions. To fulfi ll their emission-limitation commitments under the KP, industrialized countries (listed in the KP\u2019s Annex I) can use land-based activities, such as reducing deforestation, establishing new forests (afforestation and reforestation) and other vegetation types, managing agricultural and forestlands in a way that the \u201ccarbon sink\u201d is maximized. Annex I countries may also claim credit for carbon sequestration in developing countries by afforestation and reforestation (AR) through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), one of the Kyoto mechanisms that allow countries to achieve reductions where it is economically effi cient to do so. For the period 2008-12, forestry activities under the CDM have been restricted to afforestation and reforestation on areas that were not forested in 1990. In addition, CDM projects must lead to emission reductions or net carbon uptake additional to what would have occurred without the CDM funding. Annex I Parties can only use credits from AR CDM up to an annual 1% of their base-year emission, or 5% during the entire Kyoto commitment period. In December 2003, the ninth session to the Conference of the Parties (COP9) to the UNFCCC took a decision addressing the contentious issue of non-permanence\u2014 as well as additionality, leakage, uncertainties, and socioeconomic and environmental impacts\u2014associated with AR project activities under the CDM (UNFCCC 2003). 28 | Should We Include Avoidance of Deforestation? Only expiring carbon credits will be issued from AR CDM projects (\u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201clong-term\u201d Certifi ed Emission Reductions (CERs) alternatively), so that credits expire before termination of the project, or when the carbon is released back to the atmosphere prematurely. In both cases, the investor that used the credits to get into compliance will be debited accordingly. The decision also acknowledges that is up to host Parties to evaluate risks associated with AR projects, such as the use of invasive alien species and genetically modifi ed organisms, according to their national laws. The text of the decision also invites Parties\u2019 submissions on simplifi ed modalities and procedures for small-scale projects and their implementation. In contrast, activities aimed at reversing or slowing deforestation in developing countries are excluded for the fi rst commitment period of the KP (2008-2012). Arguments against allowing deforestation avoidance activities were high uncertainties of GHG-reduction estimates, the potentially large scale of credits, non-permanence, and leakage concerns (Bonnie et al. 2000; Marland et al. 2001). The compensated reduction proposal At a COP9 side event, Santilli et al. (2003a) presented a new proposal to include deforestation avoidance in tropical countries under the KP. The proposal labelled \u201ccompensated reduction\u201d includes as its main element a voluntary national deforestation stabilization and reduction target for non-Annex I countries such as Brazil or Indonesia. Its objective is to encourage conservation policies. If these policies prove successful by the end of the fi rst commitment period, the respective carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reductions, once monitored and verifi ed, can be sold to industrialized countries after the end of the fi rst commitment period at the carbon market prices prevailing at that time (Santilli et al. 2003b). The proposed baseline for Brazil would be the average emissions from deforestation during the 1980s (Santilli et al., 2003a), or the 1990s (Santilli et al. 2003b). For other countries, other baseline periods might be adequate. Who would be the buyers of these credits? While one paper talks of \u201cgovernments or private investors\u201d (Santilli et al. 2003b), the other one stresses that \u201c...this would not be a market mechanism like the CDM [...], but an agreement between governments\u201d (Santilli et al. 2003b). Even in this latter case, the authors see these credits as being transferred through international emissions trading markets. Voluntary markets are emerging and other ecosystem services such as biodiversity values may be bundled. Emission credits may not be the primary objective as private sectors are also eager to build their image to society. In addition, public funding, although relatively small has yet to be mobilized. No substantial efforts have been made regarding the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund under the UNFCCC managed by the Global Environment Facility. The host country would adhere to a binding, sectoral emission-limitation target by agreeing not to increase or further reduce deforestation-related emissions in the future. Obviously any increase in GHG emissions above the target would reverse credits already sold to Annex I countries, and thus result in non-compliance with this voluntary, but once agreed, binding emission-limitation target. Schlamadinger et al. | 29 The proposal was cautiously supported by representatives of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment at the COP9 side event, which is signifi cant because Brazil had opposed the inclusion of deforestation avoidance in previous negotiating sessions. The proposal re-opened the debate about the inclusion of deforestation avoidance among the possible measures for reaching KP targets by Annex I countries. The \u201ccompensated reduction proposal\u201d is similar to the way deforestation is addressed in the case of Australia (an Annex I country) under Articles 3.3 and 3.7 of the Protocol, based on \u201cnet-net accounting.\u201d In this approach, the emissions from deforestation in the commitment period are compared to those in 1990, and any reduction in deforestation emissions will bring the country closer to compliance with its Kyoto targets. Pros and cons of the proposal It may be argued that the proposal might lead to inclusion of \u201chot air\u201d in the Kyoto system, to the extent that actual emissions\u2014even without efforts to reduce them\u2014may be less than the base-year emissions or a baseline calculated in other ways. We believe that such hot air, to a limited extent, is inevitable, and occurs in many situations under the KP. What is essential is that the proposal provides a real incentive, at the margin of the no-interference situation, to reduce deforestation. Nevertheless, efforts should be taken to calculate the baseline such that it minimizes hot air to the extent possible, while not creating too much risk of \u201cnon-compliance\u201d of the countries concerned. Moreover, deforestation avoidance is already accounted for in the KP inventories of Annex I countries. Incentives to reduce deforestation at the margin of the current rate are not present in all cases (there is no incentive in some cases where special accounting rules have been introduced for other reasons). However, a point can be made that deforestation avoidance in developing countries would be a much more powerful str", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "a5a5d8de19d724aa2695b3687ca37abc5bf759bd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2006612269", "DOI": "10.1029/2004JD004683", "CorpusId": 20642913}, "title": "Modeling of in situ ultrafine atmospheric particle formation in the eastern United States", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0The creation of new atmospheric particles from in situ nucleation influences climate through cloud-aerosol interactions and may negatively impact human health.

To address this question, 20 policy instruments were assessed for their effectiveness in reducing emissions, cost-effectiveness, applicability and special conditions for success. The appraisal is based on over 60 ex-post policy evaluation reports from about 30 countries and country groups, representing best-practice examples of the application of these instruments. Appliance standards, building codes, tax exemptions and voluntary labelling were found to be the most effective policy instruments contrary to others such as Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms or energy/carbon taxation. The most cost-effective instruments, all achieving energy savings at negative costs for society, were appliance standards, demand-side management programmes and mandatory labelling. Since all policy instruments have limitations and only help overcome some barriers, they are most effective if combined into policy packages designed for the respective location, economy and culture.

Reducing that risk would require restraining the growth of CO2 emissions and ultimately limiting those emissions to a level that would stabilize atmospheric concentrations which would involve costs that are also uncertain but could be substantial. The most efficient approaches to reducing emissions of CO2 involve giving businesses and households an economic incentive for such reductions. Such an incentive could be provided in various ways, including a tax on emissions, a cap on the total annual level of emissions combined with a system of tradable emission allowances, or a modified cap-and-trade program that includes features to constrain the cost of emission reductions that would be undertaken in an effort to meet the cap.

We use global climate model simulations to estimate the impacts of changing fire emissions on air quality, visibility, and premature deaths in the middle and late 21st century.

Iron can serve as an electron acceptor for AOM, and it has been suggested that Fe(III)-dependent AOM potentially comprises a major global methane sink. Although it has been proposed that anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea can facilitate this process, their active metabolic pathways have not been confirmed. Here we report the enrichment and characterisation of a novel archaeon in a laboratory-scale bioreactor fed with Fe(III) oxide (ferrihydrite) and methane. Long-term performance data, in conjunction with the 13C- and 57Fe-labelling batch experiments, demonstrated that AOM was coupled to Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) in this bioreactor.

Outer hair cells (OHCs) have active micromechanical properties that are thought to be the origin of evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs). In the present study, click-evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in humans with or without various contralateral acoustic stimulations. A previous study, concentrating on contralateral stimulation with broadband noise, had shown a decrease of the EOAE amplitude in humans. Results support a role for the efferent system in cochlear mechanics; indeed, medial efferent neurons of the olivocochlear bundle terminate on the OHCs. To obtain a better understanding of the medial efferent system functioning in humans, the present study looked at the contralateral suppressive effect as a function of stimulus parameters. 2. The study of the input-output function of the EOAE amplitude with and without a 50-dB SPL contralateral broadband noise showed that the suppressive effect was equivalent to a mean reduction of 3.77 dB. 3. For the EOAEs to tone pips, the contralateral suppressive effect was strongest when the contralateral ear stimuli were narrow bands that were centered around the central EOAE frequency. This frequency specificity disappeared for contralateral narrow band noise levels greater than 50 dB SPL. 4. The contralateral suppressive effect was also observed with transient contralateral sounds (nonfiltered clicks). Significant reductions of the EOAE amplitude were seen with contralateral click levels as low as 17.5 dB SL. Above this level, the EOAE amplitude decreased as the contralateral stimulus level increased. This effect was still present in subjects without any stapedial reflex, but absent in total unilateral hearing-loss subjects. Therefore this suppressive effect is unlikely to be due to alteration of the middle ear function or to transcranially conducted sound. 5. When the contralateral interclick interval exceeded 14.2 ms. the suppressive effect was smaller. With contralateral stimulus level maintained subjectively constant, the effect was found to disappear when the interclick interval was greater than 49.9 ms. A saturation of the contralateral suppressive effect was observed for click rates greater than 70/s (interclick interval less than 14.2 ms). 6. Our study confirms and specifies the contralateral sound suppression effect on cochlear mechanisms in humans, assessing the equivalent reduction, showing a frequency specificity and extending these findings to contralateral transient sounds. Any influence of the acoustic crosstalk was eliminated. A role played by middle ear muscles cannot be absolutely ruled out but is not necessary to produce such a contralateral suppressive effect (the effect being found in subjects after surgical removal of the stapedius muscle) and could not explain the frequency specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "year": 1991}, {"paperId": "4917152d2616c39dcea847ab36d703430b8fc55c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2053439032", "DOI": "10.1021/JP0119025", "CorpusId": 97097302}, "title": "Effect of Transition Metal Ions on the TiO2-Assisted Photodegradation of Dyes under Visible Irradiation: A Probe for the Interfacial Electron Transfer Process and Reaction Mechanism", "abstract": "The effect of metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, and Cd2+) on the photodegradation of several dyes:\u2009 sulfo-rhodamine B (SRB), alizarin red (AR), and malachite green (MG) has been investigated in aqueous TiO2 dispersions under visible irradiation (\u03bb > 420 nm).

Seventy-three Euro 6 diesel passenger cars (8 EGR only, 40 LNT, and 25 SCR) were tested on a chassis dynamometer over both the European type-approval cycle (NEDC, cold engine start) and the more realistic Worldwide harmonized light-duty test cycle (WLTC version 2.0, hot start) between 2012 and 2015. Most vehicles met the legislative limit of 0.08 g/km of NOx over NEDC (average emission factors by technology: EGR-only 0.07 g/km, LNT 0.04 g/km, and SCR 0.05 g/km), but the average emission factors rose dramatically over WLTC (EGR-only 0.17 g/km, LNT 0.21 g/km, and SCR 0.13 g/km). Five LNT-equipped vehicles exhibited very poor performance over the WLTC, emitting 7-15 times the regulated limit.

We continue with a review for the year 2020, which will be remembered by COVID and the significant negative impact it had on the industry. However, it also provided a glimpse of the possible improvement in air quality with reduced anthropogenic emissions. It was a year marked by goals set for climate change mitigation via reduced fossil fuel use by the transportation sector. Governments stepped up plans to accelerate the adoption of zero tailpipe emitting vehicles. However, any transformation of the transportation sector is not going to happen overnight due to the scale of the infrastructure and technology challenges. A case in point is China, which announced a technology roadmap which envisions half of the vehicles to be hybrids in 2035. The ICE is clearly expected to be part of the powertrain mix for a long time and as such, solutions are needed to attain near-zero emissions, even with conventional engines. The industry is naturally responding to all of these changes and several technology solutions are being advanced, including improved efficiency, advanced aftertreatment systems, hybridization, low carbon fuels and predictive control strategies. It was also a year of heightened regulatory activity on what could perhaps be the last major regulations on criteria pollutants in advanced markets. California adopted the Low NOx Omnibus rule requiring a 90% reduction in NOx from heavy-duty vehicles. Elements of light-duty LEV IV regulations were discussed, which could culminate in a fleet averaged NMOG + NOx limit of 20 mg/mi. Proposals were made for Euro 7/VII, and several major changes put forth for consideration, including tightening of limits, inclusion of sub-23 nm particles, an emphasis on urban driving and an overall shift in certification based on real-world driving emission measurements with limited allowed exclusions. Limits may be imposed on previously non-regulated species such as NH3 which will drive additional content. Technologies are advancing, both on engines and aftertreatment systems. Light-duty gasoline engines are approaching 45% BTE. Heavy duty diesel engines are approaching 55% BTE. We cover some of the major technologies being pursued to extend these gains. Gasoline particulate filters are now rapidly becoming a mature technology for light-duty vehicles in Europe and China, although the next round of regulations will require a significant increase in filtration efficiency. Concept studies show pathways to reduce gas emissions well below the next proposed limits. A major thrust on the heavy-duty side is to analyze systems capable of meeting the low NOx requirements while also extending durability. We cover the various leading approaches and latest advances in de-NOx technologies. We also briefly touch upon fuels, which will play a critical role, whether in improving efficiency of advanced combustion such as gasoline compression ignition or in their role with reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable or synthetic fuels. Finally, as we approach near-zero tailpipe emission levels, non-tailpipe emissions could become a significant fraction of the overall particulate inventory. \u00a9 2021 SAE International.

The paper begins by exploring the economics, flaws, and inefficiencies of these two mechanisms, finding them to be an inadequate solution to global climate change as they lead to insufficient and inefficient greenhouse gas reductions. The CDM and JI promote insufficient emissions reductions by allowing industrialized nations to swap domestic emissions for corresponding reductions in the developing world without any net global greenhouse gas reductions. Secondly, the two mechanisms award emissions reduction credits based off the global warming potential of the greenhouse gases reduced, rather than the costs of abatement, which can lead to gross market distortions. More critically, it allows industrialized nations to satisfy a large share of their Kyoto obligations by investing in a few isolated super-pollutant projects, thereby depriving the developing world of the necessary low-carbon technology transfer and improvements in sustainable development promised under the Kyoto Protocol. In response to these flaws, the author proposes \"discounting\" or reducing the number of emissions credits issued for a project, while maintaining the same level of actual emission reductions, thereby promoting net greenhouse gas reductions. Specifically he proposes discounting the value of credits generated by CDM and JI projects to more closely reflect the project's marginal cost of abatement and transactional costs.

Forest sector emissions tracked with our life cycle assessment model decreased by 17%, partially meeting emissions reduction goals. Harvest residue bioenergy use did not reduce short-term emissions. Cobenefits include increased water availability and biodiversity of forest species. Our improved analysis framework can be used in other temperate regions. Strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but ecosystem process-based integration of climate change, enhanced CO2, disturbance from fire, and management actions at regional scales are extremely limited. Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon\u2019s net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72% of total emissions in 2011\u20132015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires.

Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products.

Cultured denitrifying prokaryotes show characteristic transient accumulation of NO2\u2212, NO and N2O during transition from oxic to anoxic respiration, when tested under standardized conditions, but this character appears unrelated to phylogeny. Thus, although the denitrifying community of soils may differ in their propensity to emit N2O, it may be difficult to predict such characteristics by analysis of the community composition. A common feature of strains tested in our laboratory is that the relative amounts of N2O produced (N2O/(N2+N2O) product ratio) is correlated with acidity, apparently owing to interference with the assembly of the enzyme N2O reductase. The same phenomenon was demonstrated for soils and microbial communities extracted from soils. Liming could be a way to reduce N2O emissions, but needs verification by field experiments.

A huge number of cars were manufactured during this time that provided society with a high degree of personal mobility and without the continuous development of emissions control technologies the atmospheric pollution derived from them would have been overwhelming. Three-way catalysts (TWC) were introduced on traditional gasoline powered cars in the early 1980s to control the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and have since been developed so that today tailpipe emissions of these pollutants can be reduced by more than 99.5% and tailpipe emission levels can be less than in the surrounding ambient air. During more recent years, and especially in Europe, the proportion of diesel powered cars has increased rapidly so now about half of new European cars have a diesel engine. Control of their tailpipe emissions has been particularly challenging because of their low exhaust gas temperature and the presence of excess oxygen. Under these conditions TWCs cannot be used and alternative technologies were developed for the control of HCs and CO by oxidation catalysts. An undesirable characteristic of older diesel engines was the black soot they produced. This was considerably reduced by fuelling and combustion engineering improvements and was effectively eliminated by the use of diesel particulate filters (DPFs) which were introduced a decade ago. The remaining difficult challenge has been the control of NOx emissions from both light and heavy duty diesel vehicles. Two technologies have been recently introduced to do this, though only one, ammonia selective catalytic reduction (SCR), appears to be able to provide the necessary performance for future demands under a wide range of driving conditions. The present book is about diesel engine NOx emissions control by ammonia (derived from urea) SCR, and before detailing the book\u2019s contents some background information is given which provides a suitable context.

At our study site, anthropogenic eutrophication over recent decades has led to an upward migration of the sulfate/methane transition zone in the sediment. Abundant iron oxides and high dissolved ferrous iron indicate iron reduction in the methanogenic sediments below the newly established sulfate/methane transition.

Eutrophication of coastal environments may therefore create geochemical conditions favorable for iron-mediated AOM and thus increase the relevance of iron-dependent methane oxidation in the future.

Exposures to ambient and household fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) together are among the largest single causes of premature mortality in India according to the Global Burden of Disease Studies (GBD). Several recent investigations have estimated that household emissions are the largest contributor to ambient PM2.5 exposure in the country.

Due to persistent reliance on fossil fuels, it is posited that transport is more difficult to decarbonize than other sectors. To test this hypothesis, we compare long-term transport energy demand and emission projections for China, USA and the world from five large-scale energy-economy models. We diagnose the model's characteristics by subjecting them to three climate policies. We systematically analyze mitigation levers along the chain of causality from mobility to emissions, finding that some models lack relevant mitigation options. We partially confirm that transport is less reactive to a given carbon tax than the non-transport sectors: in the first half of the century, transport mitigation is delayed by 10\u201330 years compared to non-transport mitigation. At high carbon prices towards the end of the century, however, the three global models achieve deep transport emission reductions by >90% through the use of advanced vehicle technologies and low-carbon primary energy; especially biomass with CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) plays a crucial role.

Some recent field and pilot studies suggest that the operation of SCR could affect the chemical form of mercury (Hg) in coal combustion flue gases. The speciation of Hg is an important factor influencing the control and environmental fate of Hg emissions from coal combustion. The vanadium and titanium oxides, used commonly in the vanadia-titania SCR catalyst for catalytic NOx reduction, promote the formation of oxidized mercury (Hg2+). The work reported in this paper focuses on the impact of SCR on elemental mercury (Hg0) oxidation. Bench-scale experiments were conducted to investigate Hg0 oxidation in the presence of simulated coal combustion flue gases and under SCR reaction conditions. Flue gas mixtures with different concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for simulating the combustion of bituminous coals and subbituminous coals were tested in these experiments. The effects of HCl and SO2 in the flue gases on Hg0 oxidation under SCR reaction conditions were studied. It was observed that HCl is the most critical flue gas component that causes conversion of Hg0 to Hg2+ under SCR reaction conditions. The importance of HCl for Hg0 oxidation found in the present study provides the scientific basis for the apparent coal-type dependence observed for Hg0 oxidation occurring across the SCR reactors in the field.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "2f14c7185cd9969a2f539d83d3777d6415da6adc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2750023029", "DOI": "10.1039/C7SE00344G", "CorpusId": 103959495}, "title": "Two-dimensional nanomaterials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar fuels", "abstract": "As a \u201ckill two birds with one stone\u201d approach, photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar fuels can save supplying energy and simultaneously protect our environment.

As adaptation depends on socio-economic status, the rank order of most vulnerable countries is different than the rank order of most exposed countries. Because the momentum of sea level rise is so large, mitigation can reduce impacts only to a limited extent. Stabilising carbon dioxide concentrations at 550\u00a0ppm would cut impacts in 2100 by about 10%. However, the costs of emission reduction lower the avoided impacts by up to 25% (average 10%).

It is shown that DPTZ\u2010DBTO2 has minimal singlet\u2013triplet energy splitting due to its near\u2010rigid molecular geometry. However, the electronic coupling between the local triplet (3LE) and the charge transfer states, singlet and triplet, (1CT, 3CT), and the effect of dynamic rocking of the D\u2013A units about the orthogonal geometry are crucial for efficient TADF to be achieved. In solvents with low polarity, the guest emissive singlet 1CT state couples directly to the near\u2010degenerate 3LE, efficiently harvesting the triplet states by a spin orbit coupling charge transfer mechanism (SOCT). However, in solvents with higher polarity the emissive CT state in DPTZ\u2010DBTO2 shifts below (the static) 3LE, leading to decreased TADF efficiencies. The relatively large energy difference between the 1CT and 3LE states and the extremely low efficiency of the 1CT to 3CT hyperfine coupling is responsible for the reduction in TADF efficiency. Both the electronic coupling between 1CT and 3LE, and the (dynamic) orientation of the D\u2013A units are thus critical elements that dictate reverse intersystem crossing processes and thus high efficiency in TADF.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "53d00cf5009da339b8a928c2f37fb05e4f948a67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129464682", "DOI": "10.1002/cssc.200700168", "CorpusId": 9410564, "PubMed": "18605090"}, "title": "The renewable chemicals industry.", "abstract": "The possibilities for establishing a renewable chemicals industry featuring renewable resources as the dominant feedstock rather than fossil resources are discussed in this Concept.
