This nearly 30 year record illustrates the large reductions in light-duty vehicle tailpipe emissions and the remarkable improvements in emissions control durability to maintain low emissions over increasing periods of time. Since 1989 fuel specific carbon monoxide (CO) emissions have been reduced by an order of magnitude and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by more than a factor of 20. Nitric oxide (NO) emissions have only been collected since 1997 but have seen reductions of 79%. This has increased the skewness of the emissions distribution where the 2016 fleet's 99th percentile contributes \u223c3 times more of the 1990 total for CO and HC emissions. There are signs that these reductions may be leveling out as the emissions durability of Tier 2 vehicles in use today has almost eliminated the emissions reduction benefit of fleet turnover. Since 1997, the average age of the Chicago on-road fleet has increased 2 model years and the percentage of passenger vehicles has dropped from 71 to 52% of the fleet.

Owing to their large-scale use, production of cement and concrete results in substantial emission of greenhouse gases and places strain on the availability of natural resources, such as water. Projected urbanization over the next 50\u2013100 years therefore indicates that the demand for cement and concrete will continue to increase, necessitating strategies to limit their environmental impact. In this Review, we shed light on the available solutions that can be implemented within the next decade and beyond to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cement and concrete production. As the construction sector has proven to be very slow-moving and risk-averse, we focus on minor improvements that can be achieved across the value chain, such as the use of supplementary cementitious materials and optimizing the clinker content of cement. Critically, the combined effect of these marginal gains can have an important impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% if all stakeholders are engaged. In doing so, we reveal credible pathways for sustainable concrete use that balance societal needs, environmental requirements and technical feasibility. Concrete is one of the most widely used man-made materials and is critical for the ongoing urbanization of the global population. However, owing to its widespread use, concrete can have a negative impact on the environment. This Review provides medium-term and long-term solutions to address the environmental concerns surrounding concrete production. Large-scale replacement of cement by other materials is not possible within the next decade. The environmental impact of cement and concrete production is low per unit volume of material, but the amounts used make the impact of the concrete sector highly important. Reductions in CO2 emissions are possible through the introduction of improvements across the cement and concrete value chain. By engaging all stakeholders in the construction sector, immediate greenhouse gas savings on the order of 50% could be reached without heavy investment in new industrial infrastructure or modification of existing standards.

Henceforth, an immediate response from the transportation sector, one of the largest producers of GHGs (up to 30% in the United States), is critical for GHGs reduction. Recent advancement in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers a technical solution to implement emission pricing effectively in a reasonable period of time. Further, this strategy can foster demand for efficient vehicles and high transit ridership while reducing GHGs emission and generating revenue. Therefore, in this study, we propose models for understanding the reduction of GHGs emission and shifts of private vehicle trips to transit by implementing ITS-based optimal emission pricing to reduce GHGs emission by a certain percentage in a composite transportation network (transit and highway network). The bilevel models presented in this study take into account the planner's policy decision and the road user's response to such policies in a simple and methodologically robust framework. The complex decision of choosing transit over private vehicle and road user behavior in the study has been studied by mode split functions and the classical user equilibrium principle. The performance of proposed models is compared to the base case (do nothing); reductions in total GHGs emission by optimal emission pricing shows efficacy of the models.

When averaged over the three treatment plots, both N2O and NO emission showed only little response to the drought.

On the plot with the weakest water table reduction hardly any response could be observed, while on the plot with the greatest drainage effect, N2O and NO fluxes increased by 530% and 270%, respectively.

Current political efforts addressing this issue (i.e. emission performance standards in the EU) are directed towards car manufacturers. Concretely, the whole car industry has to comply with an average of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre between 2012 and 2015, with interim targets. The long-term target for 2020 is an average of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre (by way of comparison, passenger cars currently emit 160 grams of CO2 per kilometre on average). Manufacturers who exceed the specified standard will have to pay fines. From an economic point of view this measure has to be regarded critically. But given the present EU regulation the question arises as to what the optimal strategy for car manufacturers is. Exceeding the emission standard generates costs (through the payment of fines) { but so does complying with the emission standard (through costly abatement measures). Depending on the amount consumers are willing to pay for a specific reduction in CO2 emissions it could well be optimal for manufacturers to exceed the mandatory standard. This paper focuses on the demand side. It examines whether CO2 emissions per kilometre is a relevant attribute in car choices. Based on a stated preference experiment among potential car buyers from Germany, different mixed logit specifications are estimated. In addition, distributions of willingness to pay measures for an abatement of CO2 emissions are obtained. The results suggest that the emissions performance of a car matters substantially, but its consideration varies heavily across the sampled population. In particular, some evidence on gender, age and education effects on climate concerns is provided.

But there is no evidence of whether US patterns hold in other developed economies. I provide the first analysis of the pollution intensity of EU production and imports to examine which forces drove the EU cleanup. I find that concerns about the effect of pollution offshoring were unfounded in the European Union, not because the effect was small like in the United States, but because the patterns of specialization of EU production and imports were exactly opposite to what pollution offshoring would predict. Starting in the early 2000s, EU manufacturing increasingly produced more pollution-intensive goods while imports became progressively less pollution-intensive, especially from low-income countries. There are two notable exceptions: primary aluminum and electrometallurgical products, except steel, which do provide evidence of offshoring from the EU to lower income countries. The \u201cbrown\u201d specialization of EU production is difficult to explain, but about a quarter can be matched by increased demand for EU exports of polluting goods.

With this technology advancement, regulated gaseous and particulate matter emissions have been significantly reduced. Two CNG transit buses equipped with stoichiometric combustion engines and TWCs were tested on a chassis dynamometer, and their emissions were measured. Emissions from the stoichiometric engines with TWCs were then compared to the emissions from lean-burn CNG transit buses tested in previous studies. Stoichiometric combustion with TWC was effective in reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) by 87% to 98% depending on pollutants and test cycles, compared to lean combustion. The high removal efficiencies exceeded the emission reduction required from the certification standards, especially for NOX and PM. While the certification standards require 95% and 90% reductions for NOX and PM, respectively, from the engine model years 1998\u20132003 to the engine model year 2007, the measured NOX and PM emissions show 96% and 95% reductions, respectively, from the lean-burn engines to the stoichiometric engines with TWC over the transient Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle. One drawback of stoichiometric combustion with TWC is that this technology produces higher carbon monoxide (CO) emissions than lean combustion. In regard to controlling CO emissions, lean combustion with OxC is more effective than stoichiometric combustion. Stoichiometric combustion with TWC produced higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) than lean combustion during the UDDS cycle, but lower GHG emissions during the steady-state cruise cycle. Implications: Stoichiometric combustion with three-way catalyst is currently the best emission control technology available for compressed natural gas (CNG) transit buses to meet the stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2010 heavy-duty engine NOX emissions standard.

With respect to conventional Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO 2 emissions by 90 percent reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 40 percent. These penalties can be reduced by accepting lower reductions of CO 2 emissions. Compared to the semiclosed cycle considered by other authors, where CO 2 is the main component of the gas turbine working fluid, the plants analyzed here exhibit higher efficiency over the whole range of specific CO 2 emission.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "d7387abbb9a4c74267857d2f99b79360e31e45ec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1565527268", "CorpusId": 221611626}, "title": "The effects on developing countries of the Kyoto Protocol and CO\u2082 emissions trading", "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of the Kyoto Protocol on developing economies using marginal abatement curves generated by MIT\u2019s Emissions Prediction and Policy Assessment model (EPPA).

This has been done through analysis Parties\u2019 official information concerning the role of LULUCF mitigation efforts for reaching INDC targets as presented in National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, and Additional file 1.ResultsOn the aggregate global level, the Parties themselves perceive that net LULUCF emissions will increase over time. Overall, the net LULUCF emissions are estimated to increase by 0.6 Gt CO2e year\u22121 (range: 0.1\u20131.1) in 2020 and 1.3 Gt CO2e\u00a0year\u22121 (range: 0.7\u20132.1) in 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. On the other hand, the full implementation of the INDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction of net LULUCF emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels. It is estimated that if all conditional and unconditional INDCs are implemented, net LULUCF emissions would decrease by 0.5 Gt CO2e year\u22121 (range: 0.2\u20130.8) by 2020 and 0.9 Gt CO2e year\u22121 (range: 0.5\u20131.3) by 2030, both compared to 2010 levels.

We conducted field and laboratory experiments using leaves of white poplar (Populus alba L.) to identify whether an inverse relationship occurs between the dark respiration rate (a mitochondrial process) and the isoprene emission rate. Field experiments that were carried out in a free-air CO(2)-enriched (FACE) facility showed no clear effect of elevated CO(2) on either isoprene emission rate or respiration rate by leaves. In young, not yet fully expanded leaves, low isoprene emission and high dark respiration rates were measured in both ambient and elevated CO(2). In these leaves, isoprene emission was inversely correlated with dark respiration. It is possible to interpret from these results that, in young leaves, high rates of growth respiration compete with isoprene biosynthesis for the same substrate. However, it is also possible that the negative correlation reflects the contrasting reductions in growth respiration and increases in expression of the enzyme isoprene synthase at this final stage of leaf maturation. In contrast to our observations on young leaves, respiration rate and isoprene emission rate were positively correlated in older, fully expanded leaves (8 and 11 from apex). A positive correlation was also found between respiration rate and isoprene emission rate when these parameters were modulated using different ozone exposure, growth light intensity, growth temperature and exposure to different leaf temperatures in laboratory experiments. These data show that competition for substrate between isoprene biosynthesis and leaf respiration does not determine the rate of isoprene emission in most circumstances that affect both processes. A negative correlation was observed across all experiments between isoprene emission rate and the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc), a cytosolic enzyme that competes with isoprene biosynthesis for substrate. The cytosolic metabolite, PEP, occurs at a metabolic branch point from which substrate flows into three processes: (1) the production of pyruvate for mitochondrial respiration, (2) the production of oxaloacetate (OAA) by PEPc for anabolic support of mitochondrial respiration and (3) transport into the chloroplast to support chloroplastic demands for pyruvate, including isoprenoid biosynthesis. The results of our observations suggest that only the second process competes for substrate with isoprenoid synthesis, while the partitioning of PEP between mitochondrial respiration and chloroplast isoprenoid biosynthesis is controlled in a way that retains balance in substrate demand.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "3f91d0c93f024d143b5500e2d2d32285afcf38fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047685603", "DOI": "10.1021/ES034352S", "CorpusId": 42682881, "PubMed": "14717192"}, "title": "Simulation and evaluation of elemental mercury concentration increase in flue gas across a wet scrubber.", "abstract": "Experimental data from a laboratory-scale wet scrubber simulator confirmed that oxidized mercury, Hg2+, can be reduced by aqueous S(IV) (sulfite and/or bisulfite) species and results in elemental mercury (HgO) emissions under typical wet FGD scrubber conditions.

Recently, version 5.1 of the CMAQ model (v5.1) was released to the public, incorporating a large number of science updates and extended capabilities over the previous release version of the model (v5.0.2). These updates include the following: improvements in the meteorological calculations in both CMAQ and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model used to provide meteorological fields to CMAQ, updates to the gas and aerosol chemistry, revisions to the calculations of clouds and photolysis, and improvements to the dry and wet deposition in the model. Sensitivity simulations isolating several of the major updates to the modeling system show that changes to the meteorological calculations result in enhanced afternoon and early evening mixing in the model, periods when the model historically underestimates mixing. This enhanced mixing results in higher ozone (O3) mixing ratios on average due to reduced NO titration, and lower fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations due to greater dilution of primary pollutants (e.g., elemental and organic carbon). Updates to the clouds and photolysis calculations greatly improve consistency between the WRF and CMAQ models and result in generally higher O3 mixing ratios, primarily due to reduced cloudiness and attenuation of photolysis in the model. Updates to the aerosol chemistry result in higher secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations in the summer, thereby reducing summertime PM2.5 bias (PM2.5 is typically underestimated by CMAQ in the summer), while updates to the gas chemistry result in slightly higher O3 and PM2.5 on average in January and July. Overall, the seasonal variation in simulated PM2.5 generally improves in CMAQv5.1 (when considering all model updates), as simulated PM2.5 concentrations decrease in the winter (when PM2.5 is generally overestimated by CMAQ) and increase in the summer (when PM2.5 is generally underestimated by CMAQ). Ozone mixing ratios are higher on average with v5.1 vs. v5.0.2, resulting in higher O3 mean bias, as O3 tends to be overestimated by CMAQ throughout most of the year (especially at locations where the observed O3 is low); however, O3 correlation is largely improved with v5.1. Sensitivity simulations for several hypothetical emission reduction scenarios show that v5.1 tends to be slightly more responsive to reductions in NOx (NO + NO2), VOC and SOx (SO2 + SO4) emissions than v5.0.2, representing an improvement as previous studies have shown CMAQ to underestimate the observed reduction in O3 due to large, widespread reductions in observed emissions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "bbecf8fbaf8431b92beda2ad83cbaff82a9c2405", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2149222695", "DOI": "10.1177/0734242X09345276", "CorpusId": 45185013, "PubMed": "19808739"}, "title": "Energy use and recovery in waste management and implications for accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions", "abstract": "The energy system plays an essential role in accounting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from waste management systems and waste technologies.

This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual. Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies.

No reduction in the SA luminescence is seen when co-sublimating ZnS and AgS, implying that it is not possible to remove the S-vacancy completely.

Carbohydrates also beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species that are already resident in the cecum and colon of pigs and are known to extend health-promoting properties. Ammonia emissions were reduced significantly in monogastric animal manure by adding a variety of carbohydrate sources to the basal diet, although certain fractions of carbohydrates are not involved or are less involved in reducing these emissions. When sucrose thermal oligosacchride caramel (STOP) was added to the basal diet of pigs at 2%, both stored manure and fresh manure had reductions of 62 and 37%, respectively, in NH3-N, while total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) in the stored manure and fresh manure declined by 55 and 35%, respectively. The addition of cellulose at 5% to the pigs basal diet resulted in NH3-N reductions of 73 and 68% in stored and fresh manure, respectively. TKN levels were reduced by 35 and 61%, respectively, in stored manure and fresh manure. The addition of paper products at 2.5 to 5.0% reduced ammonia emission by 29 to 47%. Soybean hulls added at 10% reduced emissions 21 to 41%. When sugar beets were added at 6.1% of the diet, ammonia reduction was 45%.

However, these effects on ammonia emission and nitrogen excretion need to be verified in practical situations.

Data processing algorithms that separate astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric fluctuations in the data timestream are presented. These algorithms reproduce the structure of the astronomical sky over a limited range of angular scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of bright sources.

The model is used to test the hypotheses that direct PFO emissions can account for levels observed in the global oceans and that ocean water transport to the Arctic is an important global distribution pathway. The model emission scenarios are derived from historical and projected PFO emissions solely from direct sources. Modeled ocean water concentrations compare favorably to observed PFO concentrations in the world's oceans and thus ocean inventories can be accounted for by direct sources. The model results support the hypothesis that long-range ocean transport of PFO to the Arctic is important and estimate a net PFO influx of approximately 8-23 tons per year flowing into the model's Northern Polar zone in 2005, an amount at least 1 order of magnitude greater than estimated PFO flux to the Arctic from potential indirect sources such as atmospheric transport and degradation of fluorotelomer alcohols. Modeled doubling times of ocean water concentrations in the Arctic between 1975 and 2005 of approximately 7.5-10 years are in good agreement with doubling times of PFO in Arctic biota estimated from monitoring data. The model is further applied to predict future trends in PFO contamination levels using forecasted (2005-2050) direct emissions, including substantial reductions committed to by industry. Modeled ocean water concentrations in zones near to sources decline markedly after 2005, whereas modeled concentrations in the Arctic are predicted to continue to increase until approximately 2030 and show no significant decrease for the remaining 20 years of the model simulation.

Abstract There are two sides to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which appear at risk of contradiction. One calls for humanity to achieve \u201charmony with nature\u201d and to protect the planet from degradation, with specific targets laid out in Goals 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15. The other calls for continued global economic growth equivalent to 3% per year, as outlined in Goal 8, as a method for achieving human development objectives. The SDGs assume that efficiency improvements will suffice to reconcile the tension between growth and ecological sustainability. This paper draws on empirical data to test whether this assumption is valid, paying particular attention to two key ecological indicators: resource use and CO2 emissions. The results show that global growth of 3% per year renders it empirically infeasible to achieve (a) any reductions in aggregate global resource use and (b) reductions in CO2 emissions rapid enough to stay within the carbon budget for 2\u00b0C. In other words, Goal 8 violates the sustainability objectives of the SDGs. The paper proposes specific changes to SDG targets in order to resolve this issue, such as removing the requirement of aggregate global growth and introducing quantified objectives for resource use per capita with substantial reductions in high\u2010income nations. Scaling down resource use is also the most feasible way to achieve the climate target, as it reduces energy demand.

We conducted a field study in eastern Nebraska, USA to quantify GHG emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the net global warming potential (GWP) in four irrigated systems: continuous maize with recommended best management practices (CC\u2010rec) or intensive management (CC\u2010int) and maize\u2013soybean rotation with recommended (CS\u2010rec) or intensive management (CS\u2010int). Grain yields of maize and soybean were generally within 80\u2013100% of the estimated site yield potential. Large soil surface carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were mostly associated with rapid crop growth, high temperature and high soil water content. Within each crop rotation, soil CO2 efflux under intensive management was not consistently higher than with recommended management. Owing to differences in residue inputs, SOC increased in the two continuous maize systems, but decreased in CS\u2010rec or remained unchanged in CS\u2010int. N2O emission peaks were mainly associated with high temperature and high soil water content resulting from rainfall or irrigation events, but less clearly related to soil NO3\u2010N levels. N2O fluxes in intensively managed systems were only occasionally greater than those measured in the CC\u2010rec and CS\u2010rec systems. Fertilizer\u2010induced N2O emissions ranged from 1.9% to 3.5% in 2003, from 0.8% to 1.5% in 2004 and from 0.4% to 0.5% in 2005, with no consistent differences among the four systems.

However, due to increased soil C sequestration continuous maize systems had lower GWP than maize\u2013soybean systems and intensive management did not cause a significant increase in GWP.

Despite a voluminous literature on the topic, there are surprisingly few works that conduct an ex-post analysis, examining how carbon pricing has actually performed. This paper provides a meta-review of ex-post quantitative evaluations of carbon pricing policies around the world since 1990. Four findings stand out. First, though carbon pricing has dominated many political discussions of climate change, only 37 studies assess the actual effects of the policy on emissions reductions, and the vast majority of these are focused on Europe. Second, the majority of studies suggest that the aggregate reductions from carbon pricing on emissions are limited\u2014generally between 0% and 2% per year. However, there is considerable variation across sectors. Third, in general, carbon taxes perform better than emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Finally, studies of the EU-ETS, the oldest ETS, indicate limited average annual reductions\u2014ranging from 0% to 1.5% per annum.

Direct and/or indirect land-use changes that result from their cultivation can cause emissions due to carbon losses in soils and biomass and could negate any eventual greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction benefit. This paper evaluates the implications of land-use change emission on the climate-change mitigation potential of different biofuel production systems in 12 case studies in six countries. We calculated carbon debts created by conversion of different land-use types, ranging from annual cropland to primary forest. We evaluated case studies using three different biofuel crops: oil palm, Jatropha, and soybean. The time needed for each biofuel production system to pay back its carbon debt was calculated based on a life-cycle assessment of the GHG reduction potentials of the system. Carbon debts range from 39 to 1743.7 Mg C0 2 ha -1. The oil palm case studies created the largest carbon debts (472.8-1743.7 t C0 2 ha -1) because most of the area expansion came at the expense of dense tropical forest. The highest debt was associated with plantation on peatland. For all cases evaluated, only soybean in GuarantA\u00a3 do Norte and Alta Floresta, Brazil needed less than one human generation (30 years) to repay the initial carbon debt. Highest repayment times were found for Jatropha (76-310 years) and oil palm (59-220 years) case studies. Oil palm established in peatlands had the greatest repayment times (206-220 years). High repayment times for Jatropha resulted from the combined effects of land-cover change and low CO 2 emission reduction rate. These outcomes raise serious questions about the sustainability of biofuel production. The carbon implications of conversion of (semi-)natural systems with medium to high biomass indicate that, in order to generate climate benefits, cultivation of biofuel feedstocks should be restricted to areas that already have low carbon content. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 by the author(s).", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e0c0486a2094f9a72fbd999623ba1c9692450e93", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1966364790", "DOI": "10.1080/08111140903308859", "CorpusId": 153387951}, "title": "Transport, Housing and Urban Form: The Life Cycle Energy Consumption and Emissions of City Centre Apartments Compared with Suburban Dwellings", "abstract": "Buildings in cities and the activities carried out therein use a significant proportion of a nation's energy consumption and produce substantial quantities of greenhouse gases in the process.

In this study, life cycle analysis is used to calculate the total transport and housing energy and emissions from a sample of 41 households in apartment buildings in the city centre of Adelaide, Australia and compare them with suburban households. The purpose of this is to determine whether the urban density option of higher rise dwellings offers a lower environmental impact than conventional housing. The analysis includes delivered energy and greenhouse gas emissions generated by motorised travel and activities within the dwellings, and the energy and emissions embodied in household motor vehicles and the apartment buildings. The total delivered energy consumption of apartment households was found to be lower than suburban households due mainly to higher car usage, particularly in the outer suburbs. However, the analysis of total greenhouse gas emissions provided a somewhat different comparison especially when they were considered on a per capita basis. The total per capita emissions for apartment households varied considerably but, on average, exceeded those of both the inner and outer suburban households. This resulted from lower occupancy rates and higher emissions arising from higher dwelling operational and embodied energy consumption. Overall, it cannot be assumed that centralised, higher density living will deliver per capita emission reductions for residents, once the combined per capita life cycle emissions from housing and transport have been accounted for.

Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we estimate the elasticity of carbon emissions with respect to population and income per capita in an unbalanced yearly panel of cross-country data from 1950\u20132010. We demonstrate that the elasticity with respect to population is nearly seven times larger than the elasticity with respect to income per capita and that this difference is statistically significant. Thus, the regression results imply that 1% slower population growth could be accompanied by an increase in income per capita of nearly 7% while still lowering carbon emissions. In the second part of our analysis, we use a recently constructed economic-demographic model of Nigeria to estimate the effect of lower fertility on carbon emissions, accounting for the impacts of fertility on population growth, population age structure, and income per capita. We find that by 2100 C.E. moving from the medium to the low variant of the UN fertility projection leads to 35% lower yearly emissions and 15% higher income per capita.

Our results show a distinct, replicable, pattern of nitrous oxide generation and consumption dictated by subsurface (hyporheic) residence times and biological nitrogen reduction rates.

Most subsurface exchange will not result in N2O emissions; only specific, intermediate, residence times (reaction rates) will both produce and release N2O to the stream. We also confirm previous observations that elevated nitrate and declining organic carbon reactivity increase N2O production, highlighting the importance of associated reaction rates in controlling N2O accumulation.

Although the linear model fails to track any significant impact of trade openness, the nonlinear model finds trade liberalisation to significantly affect emission reduction levels.

Holstein-Friesian cows were selected to represent the UK average for milk fat plus protein production (control line) or were selected for increased milk fat plus protein production (select line). In addition, cows received a low forage diet (50% forage) with no grazing or were on a high forage (75% forage) diet with summer grazing. A Markov chain approach was used to describe the herd structure and help estimate the GWP per year and land required per cow for the 4 alternative systems and the herd average using a partial life cycle assessment. The CO(2)-eq. emissions were expressed per kilogram of energy-corrected milk (ECM) and per hectare of land use, as well as land required per kilogram of ECM. The effects of a phenotypic and genetic standard deviation unit improvement on herd feed utilization efficiency, ECM yield, calving interval length, and incidence of involuntary culling were assessed. The low forage (nongrazing) feeding system with select cows produced the lowest CO(2)-eq. emissions of 1.1 kg/kg of ECM and land use of 0.65 m(2)/kg of ECM but the highest CO(2)-eq. emissions of 16.1t/ha of the production systems studied. Within the herd, an improvement of 1 standard deviation in feed utilization efficiency was the only trait of those studied that would significantly reduce the reliance of the farming system on bought-in synthetic fertilizer and concentrate feed, as well as reduce the average CO(2)-eq. emissions and land use of the herd (both by about 6.5%, of which about 4% would be achievable through selective breeding). Within production systems, reductions in CO(2)-eq. emissions per kilogram of ECM and CO(2)-eq. emissions per hectare were also achievable by an improvement in feed utilization.

Food waste can be reduced by various activities including preventing edible food loss, draining moisture, and home composting. These activities have different potentials for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Therefore, we conducted a life-cycle inventory analysis of household waste management scenarios for Kyoto with a special emphasis on food waste reduction activities.MethodsThe primary functional unit of our study was \u201cannual management of household combustible waste in Kyoto, Japan.\u201d Although some life-cycle assessment scenarios included food waste reduction measures, all of the scenarios had an identical secondary functional unit, \u201cannual food ingestion (mass and composition) by the residents of Kyoto, Japan.\u201d We analyzed a typical incineration scenario (Inc) and two anaerobic digestion (dry thermophilic facilities) scenarios involving either source-separated collection (SepBio) or nonseparated collection followed by mechanical sorting (MecBio). We assumed that the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for power generation. In addition, to evaluate the effects of waste reduction combined with separate collection, three food waste reduction cases were considered in the SepBio scenario: (1) preventing loss of edible food (PrevLoss); (2) draining moisture contents (ReducDrain); and (3) home composting (ReducHcom). In these three cases, we assumed that the household waste was reduced by 5%.Results and discussionThe GHG emissions from the Inc, MecBio, and SepBio scenarios were 123.3, 119.5, and 118.6 Gg CO2-eq/year, respectively. Compared with the SepBio scenario without food waste reduction, the PrevLoss and ReducDrain cases reduced the GHG emissions by 17.1 and 0.5 Gg CO2-eq/year. In contrast, the ReducHcom case increased the GHG emissions by 2.1 Gg CO2-eq/year. This is because the biogas power production decreased due to the reduction in food waste, while the electricity consumption increased in response to home composting. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a reduction of only 1% of the household waste by food loss prevention has the same GHG reduction effect as a 31-point increase (from 50% to 81%) in the food waste separation rate.ConclusionsWe found that prevention of food losses enhanced by separate collection led to a significant reduction in GHG emissions.

The aim of this study was to determine N2O emissions from cow urine after application onto a pastoral soil in different seasons between 2003 and 2005. A closed soil chamber technique was used to measure the N2O emissions from a poorly drained silt loam soil which received either 0 (control) or 1,000\u00a0kg N ha\u22121 (as real cow urine) per application. Application of cow urine to soil increased N2O fluxes above those from the control site for up to 6\u00a0weeks, but the duration for which N2O levels were elevated depended on the season. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher during the winter and spring measurement periods when the soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) was mostly above field capacity, and the emissions were lower during the summer and autumn measurement periods when the soil WFPS was below field capacity. The N2O emission factor for urine ranged from 0.02 to 1.52% of N applied.

Ten year simulations of North American current and future air-quality were carried out using a regional air-quality model driven by a regional climate model, in turn driven by a general circulation model. Three separate summer scenarios were performed: a scenario representing the years 1997 to 2006, and two SRES A2 climate scenarios for the years 2041 to 2050. The first future climate scenario makes use of 2002 anthropogenic precursor emissions, and the second applied emissions scaling factors derived from the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway 6 (RCP 6) scenario to estimate emissions for 2050 from existing 2020 projections. Ten-year averages of ozone and PM 2.5 at North American monitoring network stations were used to evaluate the model's current chemical climatology. The model was found to have a similar performance for ozone as when driven by an operational weather forecast model. The PM 2.5 predictions had larger negative biases, likely resulting from the absence of rainwater evaporation, and from sub-regional negative biases in the surface temperature fields, in the version of the climate model used here. The differences between the two future climate simulations and the current climate simulation were used to predict the changes to air-quality that might be expected in a future warmer climate, if anthropogenic precursor emissions remain constant at their current levels, versus if the RCP 6 emissions controls were adopted. Metrics of concentration, human health, and ecosystem damage were compared for the simulations. The scenario with future climate and current anthropogenic emissions resulted in worse air-quality than for current conditions \u2013 that is, the effect of climate-change alone, all other factors being similar, would be a worsening of air-quality. These effects are spatially inhomogeneous, with the magnitude and sign of the changes varying with region. The scenario with future climate and RCP 6 emissions for 2050 resulted in an improved air-quality, with decreases in key pollutant concentrations, in acute human mortality associated with air-pollution, and in sulphur and ozone deposition to the ecosystem. The positive outcomes of the RCP 6 emissions reductions were found to be of greater magnitude than the negative outcomes of climate change alone. The RCP 6 scenario however resulted in an increase in the deposition of nitrogen, as a result of increased ammonia emissions expected in that scenario, compared to current ammonia emissions levels. The results of the study raise the possibility that simultaneous reductions of greenhouse gases and air pollution precursors may further reduce air pollution levels, with the added benefits of an immediate reduction in the impacts of air pollution on human and ecosystem health. Further scenarios to investigate this possibility are therefore recommended.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a9333e0b676d7acb17852fc0f51ef57a85c06ffb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992493419", "DOI": "10.1021/IC00334A033", "CorpusId": 95147235}, "title": "Ground-state and excited-state properties of monometallic and bimetallic complexes based on rhenium(I) tricarbonyl chloride : effect of an insulating vs a conducting bridge", "abstract": "The preparation and properties of monometallic and bimetallic complexes of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl chloride coordinated to 4,4{prime}-dimethyl-2,2{prime}-bipyridine ((CH{sub 3}){sub 2}bpy), 2,2{prime}-bipyrimidine (bpm), 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine (bpp), and 1,2-bis(4{prime}-methyl-2,2{prime}-bipyridyl-4-yl)ethane (Mebpy-Mebpy) are described.

The critical bottleneck lies in activating CO2 into the CO2\u2022\u2212 radical anion or other intermediates that can be converted further, as the activation usually requires impractically high overpotentials. Recently, electrocatalysts based on oxide-derived metal nanostructures have been shown to enable CO2 reduction at low overpotentials. However, it remains unclear how the electrocatalytic activity of these metals is influenced by their native oxides, mainly because microstructural features such as interfaces and defects influence CO2 reduction activity yet are difficult to control. To evaluate the role of the two different catalytic sites, here we fabricate two kinds of four-atom-thick layers: pure cobalt metal, and co-existing domains of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide. Cobalt mainly produces formate (HCOO\u2212) during CO2 electroreduction; we find that surface cobalt atoms of the atomically thin layers have higher intrinsic activity and selectivity towards formate production, at lower overpotentials, than do surface cobalt atoms on bulk samples. Partial oxidation of the atomic layers further increases their intrinsic activity, allowing us to realize stable current densities of about 10 milliamperes per square centimetre over 40 hours, with approximately 90 per cent formate selectivity at an overpotential of only 0.24 volts, which outperforms previously reported metal or metal oxide electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. The correct morphology and oxidation state can thus transform a material from one considered nearly non-catalytic for the CO2 electroreduction reaction into an active catalyst.

The authors used [(11)C]raclopride bolus-plus-continuous-infusion positron emission tomography (PET) to determine smoking-induced ventral striatum dopamine release in humans.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwenty nicotine-dependent smokers (who smoked > or =15 cigarettes/day) underwent a [(11)C]raclopride bolus-plus-continuous-infusion PET session. During the session, subjects had a 10-minute break outside the PET apparatus during which 10 subjects smoked a cigarette and 10 did not smoke (as a control condition).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe group that smoked had greater reductions in [(11)C]raclopride binding potential in ventral striatum regions of interest than the group that did not smoke, particularly in the left ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens and left ventral putamen (range for smoking group=-25.9% to -36.6% reduction). Significant correlations were found between change from before to after the smoking break in craving ratings and change from before to after the break in binding potential for these two regions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNicotine-dependent subjects who smoked during a break in PET scanning had greater reductions in [(11)C]raclopride binding potential (an indirect measure of dopamine release) than nicotine-dependent subjects who did not smoke.

The system is designed to assimilate large (satellite) datasets, but in the current study only a limited amount of surface network observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) Global Monitoring Division (GMD) is used to test the 4D-VAR system. By design, the system is capable to adjust the emissions in such a way that the posterior simulation reproduces background CO mixing ratios and large-scale pollution events at background stations. Uncertainty reduction up to 60 % in yearly emissions is observed over well-constrained regions and the inferred emissions compare well with recent studies for 2004. However, with the limited amount of data from the surface network, the system becomes data sparse resulting in a large solution space. Sensitivity studies have shown that model uncertainties (e.g., vertical distribution of biomass burning emissions and the OH field) and the prior inventories used, influence the inferred emission estimates. Also, since the observations only constrain total CO emissions, the 4D-VAR system has difficulties in separating anthropogenic and biogenic sources in particular. The inferred emissions are validated with NOAA aircraft data over North America and the agreement is significantly improved from the prior to posterior simulation. Validation with the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument version 4 (V4) shows a slight improved agreement over the well-constrained Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics (except for the African continent). However, the model simulation with posterior emissions underestimates MOPITT CO total columns on the remote Southern Hemisphere (SH) by about 10 %.

A family of [Os(L^1)(L^2)(L^3)]^(2+) and [Os(L^1)_2(L^2)]^(2+) complexes with simple modifications in the ancillary phen or bpy ligands (L^1 and L^3) as well as the intercalating dppz ligand (L^2) was prepared. By cyclic voltammetry, electron-donating substituents on the ancillary ligands lowered the Os(3+/2+) reduction potential but did not affect the reduction potential of the dppz ligand. A methyl substituent at the 7-, 8-, or 6-position of the dppz ligand shifted the phenazine reduction toward the negative but did not affect the Os(3+/2+) potential. Absorption titrations indicated intercalative binding to DNA with high affinity (K_B \u223c10^6 M^(-1)) for the family of complexes, although at high ratios (50:1) of base pairs to metal, complexes with ancillary 4,7-dimethylphenanthroline or 4,4\u2018-dimethylbipyridine ligands exhibit less hypochromism (26\u221227%) in the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0* transition on the dppz ligand compared to complexes with 5,6-dimethylphenanthroline (30\u221237%) or the parent phen (31\u221235%). By steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy, complexes bound to DNA by intercalation with substituents on the 4,7- or 4,4\u2018-positions of the ancillary phen or bpy displayed lower quantum yields for emission (\u03a6_(em)) compared to complexes with the parent phen, while complexes with methyl substituents on the dppz ligand had the greatest \u03a6_(em). Studies with poly d(AT), poly d(GC), and mixed-sequence DNA revealed that the emission yields are also sequence-dependent. Comparative luminescence studies in CH_2Cl_2 demonstrated that these effects arise from a combination of (i) the inherent sensitivity of the excited state to ligand structure and (ii) perturbations in DNA binding geometry introduced by substituents on the ancillary and intercalating ligands.
