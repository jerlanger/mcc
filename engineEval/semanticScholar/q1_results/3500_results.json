The availability \u03b413C-CH4 measurements from atmospheric samples has significantly improved in recent years, which allows the construction of time series spanning up to about 2 decades. We have used these measurements to investigate the cause of the methane growth rate decline since 1980, with a special focus on the period 1998\u20132006 when the methane growth came to a halt. The constraints provided by the CH4 and \u03b413C-CH4 measurements are used to construct hypothetical source and sink scenarios, which are translated into corresponding atmospheric concentrations using the atmospheric transport model TM3 for evaluation against the measurements. The base scenario, composed of anthropogenic emissions according to EDGAR 4.0, constant emissions from natural sources, and a constant atmospheric lifetime, overestimates the observed global growth rates of CH4 and \u03b413C-CH4 by, respectively, 10 ppb yr\u22121 and 0.02\u2030 yr\u22121 after the year 2000. It proves difficult to repair this inconsistency by modifying trends in emissions only, notably because a temporary reduction of isotopically light sources, such as natural wetlands, leads to a further increase of \u03b413C-CH4. Furthermore, our results are difficult to reconcile with the estimated increase of 5 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in emissions from fossil fuel use in the period 2000\u20132005. On the other hand, we find that a moderate (less than 5% per decade) increase in the global OH concentration can bring the model in agreement with the measurements for plausible emission scenarios. This study demonstrates the value of global monitoring of methane isotopes, and calls for further investigation into the role OH and anthropogenic emissions to further improve our understanding of methane variations in recent years.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9bb6aaab9c8d25fed3cbc706909d1c4355c4475d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1938333251", "DOI": "10.1007/s11367-015-0909-4", "CorpusId": 16630544}, "title": "Redefining scope: the true environmental impact of smartphones?", "abstract": "PurposeThe aim of this study is to explore the literature surrounding the environmental impact of mobile phones and the implications of moving from the current business model of selling, using and discarding phones to a product service system based upon a cloud service. The exploration of the impacts relating to this shift and subsequent change in scope is explored in relation to the life cycle profile of a typical smartphone.MethodsA literature study is conducted into the existing literature in order to define the characteristics of a \u201ctypical\u201d smartphone. Focus is given to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different life cycle phases in line with that reported in the majority of literature. Usage patterns from literature are presented in order to show how a smartphone is increasingly responsible for not only data consumption but also data generation. The subsequent consequences of this for the balance of the life cycle phases are explored with the inclusion of wider elements in the potential expanded mobile infrastructure, such as servers and the network.Results and discussionFrom the available literature, the manufacturing phase is shown to dominate the life cycle of a \u201ctypical\u201d smartphone for GHG emissions. Smartphone users are shown to be increasingly reliant upon the internet for provision of their communications. Adding a server into the scope of a smartphone is shown to increase the use phase impact from 8.5 to 18.0\u00a0kg CO2-eq, other phases are less affected. Addition of the network increases the use phase by another 24.7\u00a0kg CO2-eq. In addition, it is shown that take-back of mobile phones is not effective at present and that prompt return of the phones could result in reduction in impact by best reuse potential and further reduction in toxic emissions through inappropriate disposal.ConclusionsThe way in which consumers interact with their phones is changing, leading to a system which is far more integrated with the internet. A product service system based upon a cloud service highlights the need for improved energy efficiency to make greatest reduction in GHG emissions in the use phase, and gives a mechanism to exploit residual value of the handsets by timely return of the phones, their components and recovery of materials.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "cfa0409b702630b7222946bb8dfac4a7395f7901", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1995506895", "DOI": "10.1021/JP210106B", "CorpusId": 56375021}, "title": "The Effects of Crystal Structure and Electronic Structure on Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction over Two Phases of Perovskite-Structured NaNbO3", "abstract": "Cubic and orthorhombic NaNbO3 were fabricated to study the effects of crystal structure and electronic structure on the photocatalytic activities in detail.

The local and regional influence of elevated point sources on summertime aerosol forcing and cloud-aerosol interactions in northeastern North America was investigated using the WRF-Chem community model. The direct effects of aerosols on incoming solar radiation were simulated using existing modules to relate aerosol sizes and chemical composition to aerosol optical properties. Indirect effects were simulated by adding a prognostic treatment of cloud droplet number and adding modules that activate aerosol particles to form cloud droplets, simulate aqueous-phase chemistry, and tie a two-moment treatment of cloud water (cloud water mass and cloud droplet number) to precipitation and an existing radiation scheme. Fully interactive feedbacks thus were created within the modified model, with aerosols affecting cloud droplet number and cloud radiative properties, and clouds altering aerosol size and composition via aqueous processes, wet scavenging, and gas-phase-related photolytic processes. Comparisons of a baseline simulation with observations show that the model captured the general temporal cycle of aerosol optical depths (AODs) and produced clouds of comparable thickness to observations at approximately the proper times and places. The model overpredicted SO2 mixing ratios and PM2.5 mass, but reproduced the range of observed SO2 to sulfate aerosol ratios, suggesting that atmospheric oxidation processes leading to aerosol sulfate formation are captured in the model. The baseline simulation was compared to a sensitivity simulation in which all emissions at model levels above the surface layer were set to zero, thus removing stack emissions. Instantaneous, site-specific differences for aerosol and cloud related properties between the two simulations could be quite large, as removing above-surface emission sources influenced when and where clouds formed within the modeling domain. When summed spatially over the finest resolution model domain (the extent of which corresponds to the typical size of a single global climate model grid cell) and temporally over a three day analysis period, total rainfall in the sensitivity simulation increased by 31% over that in the baseline simulation. Fewer optically thin clouds, arbitrarily defined as a cloud exhibiting an optical depth less than 1, formed in the sensitivity simulation. Domain-averaged AODs dropped from 0.46 in the baseline simulation to 0.38 in the sensitivity simulation. The overall net effect of additional aerosols attributable to primary particulates and aerosol precursors from point source emissions above the surface was a domain-averaged reduction of 5 W m\u22122 in mean daytime downwelling shortwave radiation.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "a21df9368d565a169c38dc008368089d8049dac7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2260174666", "DOI": "10.4271/710291", "CorpusId": 101646257}, "title": "NOx Reduction Catalysts for Vehicle Emission Control", "abstract": null, "year": 1971}, {"paperId": "d67db95b964b2ad5ccdb44e1e61b351dacbbb791", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2146108979", "CorpusId": 110610029}, "title": "Study to the effectiveness of the UNECE Heavy Metals Protocol and costs of possible additional measures.

Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are typically disproportionately exposed to air pollutants, and therefore climate policy could also potentially reduce these environmental inequities. We sought to explore potential social disparities in GHG and co-pollutant emissions under an existing carbon trading program\u2014the dominant approach to GHG regulation in the US and globally. Methods and findings We examined the relationship between multiple measures of neighborhood disadvantage and the location of GHG and co-pollutant emissions from facilities regulated under California\u2019s cap-and-trade program\u2014the world\u2019s fourth largest operational carbon trading program. We examined temporal patterns in annual average emissions of GHGs, particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, and air toxics before (January 1, 2011\u2013December 31, 2012) and after (January 1, 2013\u2013December 31, 2015) the initiation of carbon trading. We found that facilities regulated under California\u2019s cap-and-trade program are disproportionately located in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher proportions of residents of color, and that the quantities of co-pollutant emissions from these facilities were correlated with GHG emissions through time. Moreover, the majority (52%) of regulated facilities reported higher annual average local (in-state) GHG emissions since the initiation of trading. Neighborhoods that experienced increases in annual average GHG and co-pollutant emissions from regulated facilities nearby after trading began had higher proportions of people of color and poor, less educated, and linguistically isolated residents, compared to neighborhoods that experienced decreases in GHGs. These study results reflect preliminary emissions and social equity patterns of the first 3 years of California\u2019s cap-and-trade program for which data are available. Due to data limitations, this analysis did not assess the emissions and equity implications of GHG reductions from transportation-related emission sources. Future emission patterns may shift, due to changes in industrial production decisions and policy initiatives that further incentivize local GHG and co-pollutant reductions in disadvantaged communities. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine social disparities in GHG and co-pollutant emissions under an existing carbon trading program. Our results indicate that, thus far, California\u2019s cap-and-trade program has not yielded improvements in environmental equity with respect to health-damaging co-pollutant emissions. This could change, however, as the cap on GHG emissions is gradually lowered in the future.

We measured the glutamate receptor binding in the human brain and provided direct evidence for the abnormal glutamate system in smokers. Because antagonism of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) reduced nicotine self-administration in rats and mice, mGluR5 is suggested to be involved in nicotine addiction. mGluR5 receptor binding specifically to an allosteric site was observed by using positron emission tomography with [11C]ABP688. We found a marked global reduction (20.6%; P < 0.0001) in the mGluR5 distribution volume ratio (DVR) in the gray matter of 14 smokers. The most prominent reductions were found in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex.

Clinical variables reflecting current nicotine consumption, dependence and abstinence were not correlated with mGluR5 DVR. This decrease in mGluR5 receptor binding may be an adaptation to chronic increases in glutamate induced by chronic nicotine administration, and the decreased down-regulation seen in the ex-smokers could be due to incomplete recovery of the receptors, especially because the ex-smokers were abstinent for only 25 wk on average.

Telecommuting has the potential to reduce the number of daily trips and miles traveled with personal vehicles and, consequently, the overall emissions resulting from vehicle activity. This search studies the emissions impacts of telecommuting for the participants of the Puget Sound Telecommuting Demonstration Project (PSTDP). The California Air Resources Board's emissions models, EMFAC7F and BURDEN7F, are used to estimate the emissions on telecommuting days and non-telecommuting days, based on travel diaries completed by program participants. This study, among the first of its kind, represents the most sophisticated application of emissions models to travel diary data. Analysis of the travel diary data and the emissions model output supports the hypothesis that telecommuting has beneficial transportation and air quality impacts. The most important results are that telecommuting decreases the number of daily trips (by 30%), the vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) (by 63%), and the number of cold starts (by 44%), especially those taking place in early morning. These reductions are shown to have a large effect on daily emissions, with a 50% to 60% decrease in pollutants generated by a telecommuter's personal vehicle use on a telecommuting day. These net savings are almost entirely due to the elimination of commute trips, as non-commute trips increased by 0.33 trips per person-day (9% of the total trips), and the non-commute VMT increased by 2.2 miles. Overall reduc- tions in travel and emissions of this magnitude are observed because the telecommuters in this sample are long-distance commuters, with commutes twice as long as the regional average. However, even as telecommuting adoption moves into the mainstream, its net impacts are still expected to be beneficial- a reduction in VMT and in emissions. It is important to note that when the level of telecommuting is considered (that is, the percentage of work days that employees actually telecommute), the weekly savings are a much smaller proportion of total weekday travel. Also, these findings represent average per-capita reductions; the aggregate (or overall, regionwide) impacts are determined by scaling these reductions by the number of program participants. Thus, the aggregate effectiveness of telecommuting must take into account the number of people likely to participate as telecommuters and how often they telecommute, not just the per-capita, peroccasion impacts.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "cf6781c4a8a632cdc1b7c2518a336421f612173a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108638882", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.0406930101", "CorpusId": 15415522, "PubMed": "15536131"}, "title": "The influence of large-scale wind power on global climate.", "abstract": "Large-scale use of wind power can alter local and global climate by extracting kinetic energy and altering turbulent transport in the atmospheric boundary layer.

We do not detect X-ray or radio emission from any of the three sources, despite previous detections of radio emission from BRI?0021 and 2M0523?14. Steady and variable H? emission are detected from 2M0523?14 and BRI?0021, respectively, while no H? emission is detected from LSR?0602+39. Overall, our survey of nine M8-L5 dwarfs doubles the number of ultracool dwarfs observed in X-rays, and triples the number of L dwarfs, providing in addition the deepest limits to date, log(L X/L bol) ?5. With this larger sample we find the first clear evidence for a substantial reduction in X-ray activity, by about two orders of magnitude, from mid-M to mid-L dwarfs. We find that the decline in H? roughly follows L H?/L bol 10?0.4?(SP-6) for SP ? 6, where SP = 0 for spectral type M0. In the radio band, however, the luminosity remains relatively unchanged from M0 to L4, leading to a substantial increase in L rad/L bol. Our survey also provides the first comprehensive set of simultaneous radio/X-ray/H? observations of ultracool dwarfs, and reveals a clear breakdown of the radio/X-ray correlation beyond spectral type M7, evolving smoothly from L ?,rad/L X 10?15.5 to ~10?11.5 Hz?1 over the narrow spectral-type range M7-M9. This breakdown reflects the substantial reduction in X-ray activity beyond M7, but its physical origin remains unclear since, as evidenced by the uniform radio emission, there is no drop in the field dissipation and particle acceleration efficiency. Based on the results of our survey, we conclude that a further investigation of magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs will benefit from a two-pronged approach: multi-rotation observations of nearby known active sources and a snapshot survey of a large sample within ~50 pc to uncover rare flaring objects.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "2b86a886166cfe4d4a11dfe33c69c24352ce766e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977505684", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2015.03.091", "CorpusId": 153527906}, "title": "The cost-effectiveness of household photovoltaic systems in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia: Linking subsidies with emission reductions", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "943102e17a607d3c0da1b04b142a913c709926e0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1965161933", "DOI": "10.1111/J.2153-3490.1974.TB01974.X", "CorpusId": 222375823}, "title": "Emission of biogenic hydrogen sulfide", "abstract": "Until recently sulfur has been assumed to occur in the atmosphere principally in three forms: H 2 S, SO 2 and sulfates. The principal processes by which H 2 S is believed to be generated on a global scale are (1) nonspecific reduction of organic sulfur and (2) from sulfate reduction by anaerobic bacteria. Unfortunately, these assumptions have not been verified by analyses of the volatile sulfur compounds emitted by the micro-organisms that are supposed to be responsible for sulfur gas exchange in natural systems. To the contrary, gas chromatographic analyses using a flame photometric detector specific for sulfur at 394 nm indicates that dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) are the major compounds in the gaseous emissions from bacteria and fresh water green and blue-green algae isolated from different soil types and eutrophic as well as naturally clean waters. Analysis of the sulfur gases in a wide variety of sea water samples and those released by red, green and brown seaweeds indicate that organic sulfur emissions dominate over H 2 S. The data suggest the hypothesis that the micro-biota in the various natural systems like soil, leaf litter, lakes, ponds, rivers, and the oceans produce predominantly organic sulfides and that the reported observation of H 2 S emission from water-logged soils and anaerobic muds is related to their low pH. Presumably the biogenic production of gaseous sulfur compounds constitutes a major input in the sulfur cycle. Unfortunately, the source of strength and spatial distribution of these sources are unknown.

Here we analyse recent changes in the net land carbon sink (NLS) and its driving factors, using atmospheric inversions and terrestrial carbon models. We show that the linear trend of NLS during 1998\u20132012 is about 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 Pg C yr\u22122 , which is three times larger than during 1980\u20131998 (0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 Pg C yr\u22122). According to terrestrial carbon model simulations, the intensification of the NLS cannot be explained by CO2 fertilization or climate change alone. We therefore use a bookkeeping model to explore the contribution of changes in land-use emissions and find that decreasing land-use emissions are the dominant cause of the intensification of the NLS during the slow warming period. This reduction of land-use emissions is due to both decreased tropical forest area loss and increased afforestation in northern temperate regions. The estimate based on atmospheric inversions shows consistently reduced land-use emissions, whereas another bookkeeping model did not reproduce such changes, probably owing to missing the signal of reduced tropical deforestation. These results highlight the importance of better constraining emissions from land-use change to understand recent trends in land carbon sinks.Accelerated storage of terrestrial carbon during the slow warming period (1998\u20132012) can be predominantly attributed to lower land-use emissions due to decreased tropical forest loss and increased afforestation in the northern temperate regions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "67d44a667b37ed3ac85236052ab27c933021553b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2581648439", "DOI": "10.1017/cbo9781107415416.017", "CorpusId": 133527994}, "title": "Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)", "abstract": "Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) is unique among the sectors considered in this volume, since the mitigation potential is derived from both an enhancement of removals of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as reduction of emissions through management of land and livestock (robust evidence; high agreement).

This idealized assumption is just one of many ways in which emissions mitigation actions could play out globally, but not necessarily the most likely. This paper explores the implications of generic policy regimes that lead to stabilization of CO2 concentrations under conditions in which non-Annex I regions delay emissions reductions and in which carbon prices vary across participating regions. The resulting stabilization scenarios are contrasted with the idealized results. Delays in the date by which non-Annex I regions begin to reduce emissions raise the price of carbon in Annex I regions relative to the price of carbon in Annex I in an idealized regime for any given CO2 concentration limit. This effect increases the longer the delay in non-Annex I accession, the lower the non-Annex I carbon prices relative to the Annex I prices, and the more stringent the stabilization level. The effect of delay is very pronounced when CO2 concentrations are stabilized at 450 ppmv, however the effect is much less pronounced at 550 ppmv and above.

Their actions are highly laudable, but have they actually reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions? Purpose: This article evaluates the work of a group of innovative state-level policy entre-preneurs whose actions were chronicled by Barry Rabe, and a set of 29 state climate action plans systematically analyzed by Stephen Wheeler. It compares states with and without climate policy entrepreneurs and states with and without climate action plans, asks if either plans or entrepreneurs have been successful in reducing CO2 emissions, and identifies the elements within plans that are associated with the greatest reductions. Methods: The analysis uses multiple regression models to explain changes in per capita CO2 emissions attributable to residen-tial, commercial, transportation, and total nonindustrial end users from 1990 to 2007. A package of control variables accounts for political, social, climatic, economic, and urban form factors, while policy variables isolate the effects of climate policy entrepre-neurs, climate action planners, and specific policy recommendations within climate action plans. Results and conclusions: State-level climate actions reduce GHG emissions by a measurable but modest amount: about one half metric ton per person per year. This represents 2\u20133% of the average American's 24-ton annual total GHG emissions. The reduction is small in comparison to the magnitude of the problem, but a substantial tax increase or population shift away from sprawling areas would be necessary to achieve the same reduction. specific policies I find to be associated with lower emissions include: building efficiency in both residential and commercial sectors, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) policies in the commercial sector, and California's vehicle efficiency standards in the transportation sector. Takeaway for practice: It is encouraging that we can already identify emission reduc-tions related to state climate action. However, the observed reductions remain small com-pared to the scope of the problem. These findings should persuade states without plans to begin the planning process while encourag-ing states with plans to encourage more entrepreneurship aimed at developing a second generation of policy options for stabilizing our planet's climate with or without federal action.

The current technique for postcombustion control of nitrogen oxide emissions, ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction, suffers from various problems2,3, including poisoning of the catalysts by fly ash rich in arsenic or alkali, disposal of spent toxic catalysts and the effects of ammonia by-products on plant components downstream from the reactor. To circumvent the need for separate schemes to control SO2 and NOX, we have developed an iron(ii) thiochelate complex that enhances the solubility of NO in aqueous solution by rapidly and efficiently absorbing NO to form iron nitrosyl complexes. The bound NO is then converted to ammonia by electrochemical reduction, regenerating the active iron(ii) catalyst for continued NO capture. Our results suggest that this process can be readily integrated into existing wet limestone scrubbers for the simultaneous removal of SO2 and NOX", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "65d1e547980d589d5bde35319e46741e477ababd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171098449", "DOI": "10.1175/2008JCLI2144.1", "CorpusId": 131114478}, "title": "Controls of Global-Mean Precipitation Increases in Global Warming GCM Experiments", "abstract": "This paper examines the controls on global precipitation that are evident in the transient experiments conducted using coupled climate models collected for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The change in precipitation, water vapor, clouds, and radiative heating of the atmosphere evident in the 1% increase in carbon dioxide until doubled (1pctto2x) scenario is examined. As noted in other studies, the ensemble-mean changes in water vapor as carbon dioxide is doubled occur at a rate similar to that predicted by the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relationship. The ratio of global changes in precipitation to global changes in water vapor offers some insight on how readily increased water vapor is converted into precipitation in modeled climate change. This ratio is introduced in this paper as a gross indicator of the global precipitation efficiency under global warming. The main findings of this paper are threefold. First, increases in the global precipitation track increase atmospheric radiative energy loss and the ratio of precipitation sensitivity to water vapor sensitivity is primarily determined by changes to this atmospheric column energy loss. A reference limit to this ratio is introduced as the rate at which the emission of radiation from the clear-sky atmosphere increases as water vapor increases. It is shown that the derived efficiency based on the simple ratio of precipitation to water vapor sensitivities of models in fact closely matches the sensitivity derived from simple energy balance arguments involving changes to water vapor emission alone. Second, although the rate of increase of clear-sky emission is the dominant factor in the change to the energy balance of the atmosphere, there are two important and offsetting processes that contribute to in the model simulations studied: One involves a negative feedback through cloud radiative heating that acts to reduce the efficiency; the other is the global reduction in sensible heating that counteracts the effects of the cloud feedback and increases the efficiency. These counteracting feedbacks only apply on the global scale. Third, the negative cloud radiative heating feedback occurs through reductions of cloud amount in the middle troposphere, defined as the layer between 680 and 440 hPa, and by slight global cloud decreases in the lower troposphere. These changes act in a manner to expose the warmer atmosphere below to high clouds, thus resulting in a net warming of the atmospheric column by clouds and a negative feedback on the precipitation.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "df7964f7a12a927f0ca1cad3e0a821ea58c75b52", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2089672479", "DOI": "10.1021/es1036157", "CorpusId": 206942581, "PubMed": "21428387"}, "title": "Climate impact of biofuels in shipping: global model studies of the aerosol indirect effect.", "abstract": "Aerosol emissions from international shipping are recognized to have a large impact on the Earth's radiation budget, directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and indirectly by altering cloud properties. New regulations have recently been approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aiming at progressive reductions of the maximum sulfur content allowed in marine fuels from current 4.5% by mass down to 0.5% in 2020, with more restrictive limits already applied in some coastal regions. In this context, we use a global bottom-up algorithm to calculate geographically resolved emission inventories of gaseous (NO(x), CO, SO(2)) and aerosol (black carbon, organic matter, sulfate) species for different kinds of low-sulfur fuels in shipping. We apply these inventories to study the resulting changes in radiative forcing, attributed to particles from shipping, with the global aerosol-climate model EMAC-MADE. The emission factors for the different fuels are based on measurements at a test bed of a large diesel engine. We consider both fossil fuel (marine gas oil) and biofuels (palm and soy bean oil) as a substitute for heavy fuel oil in the current (2006) fleet and compare their climate impact to that resulting from heavy fuel oil use. Our simulations suggest that ship-induced surface level concentrations of sulfate aerosol are strongly reduced, up to about 40-60% in the high-traffic regions. This clearly has positive consequences for pollution reduction in the vicinity of major harbors. Additionally, such reductions in the aerosol loading lead to a decrease of a factor of 3-4 in the indirect global aerosol effect induced by emissions from international shipping.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "5440dc74a6d2c616098322471be8e6edcd4a8992", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1658360640", "DOI": "10.1126/SCIENCE.279.5351.669", "CorpusId": 128724816}, "title": "A Road Map for U.S. Carbon Reductions", "abstract": "Upon ratification, the Kyoto climate treaty would require substantial reductions in U.S. carbon emissions by 2008-2012.

Both particle sizes have been associated with mortality and morbidity in studies in the United States and elsewhere and an unambiguously safe level of ambient PM has been difficult to identify. PM10 concentrations have been reduced significantly in U.S. cities over the past two decades and relatively few locations continue to exceed national PM10 standards. However, the new PM2.5 standards will require further reductions in PM concentrations and additional expenditures for emission controls. Information about the health and economic benefits of achieving lower PM concentrations is important because: (1) expected costs of further PM reductions rise after the least-cost options are exhausted, and (2) there is uncertainty about the existence of a threshold safe level for PM. This paper develops and applies a methodology for quantifying the health benefits of potential reductions in ambient PM. Although uncertainties exist about several components of the methodology, the results indicate that the annual nationwide health benefits of achieving the new standards for PM2.5 relative to 1994-1996 ambient concentrations are likely to be between $14 billion and $55 billion annually, with a mean estimate of $32 billion.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "20c177a34c28fa7acf2d3358f181a5bb2b84cd9a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2367199593", "CorpusId": 131236492}, "title": "Factors Decomposition and Empirical Analysis of Variations in Energy Carbon Emission in China", "abstract": "In this paper,a decomposition model based on the extended Kaya identity was established,and impacts from economic scales,population sizes,industrial structures,energy mix and energy efficiency on carbon emission were examined in detail with the LMDI method.The model would provide sound evidence for decision making in energy-saving and emission-reduction polices at a more microcosmic level,such as readjustment of industrial structure,optimization of energy mix and improvement of energy efficiency in various industries.Variations in China's carbon emission from 1980 to 2007 were studied by using this model,and the mechanism of effects of the action was carefully analyzed and their contributions were quantified as well.Empirical results demonstrated that the economic scale effect,whose contribution ratio reached 152.73%,played a dominant role in increases in China's carbon emission,following by the energy efficiency effect was-79.93%,the population size effect was 20.20%,the industrial structure effect was 7.78%,and the energy mix effect was-0.77%,respectively.It was concluded that the industrial structural change showed positive effects on carbon emission growth during this period,due primarily to the carbon emissions from the secondary industry,whose yield scale accounted for half of GDP.This situation maintained a long-term increase.The contribution ratio of the secondary industry to carbon emissions offset the negative effects from the primary and tertiary industry.Concerning current policies about energy-saving and emission-reduction,China should focus on regulating industrial structure,optimizing energy mix,and improving energy efficiency.Corresponding policy suggestions were also given as increasing the proportion of the tertiary industry in national economy,placing emphasis on developing non-fossil-fuel resources,increasing the proportion of natural gas in the primary energy consumption by means of technology,policy and law,promoting energy efficiency,especially reducing energy intense in the secondary industry,advocating the concepts of low-carbon consumption and green consumption,and paving the way to sustainable development.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "8b7368ce2f5be1af0a3014e6be0a3099b4544242", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035201249", "PubMedCentral": "3368106", "DOI": "10.1007/s11270-012-1114-8", "CorpusId": 10575635, "PubMed": "22707804"}, "title": "Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)

This paper proposes a new method that divides low-carbon economy development processes into two separate periods: from 2020 to 2029 and from 2030 to 2050. These two periods have unique requirements and emissions reduction potential; therefore, they must involve different allocation methods, so that reduction behaviors do not stall the development of regional low-carbon economies. During the first period, a more deterministic economic development approach for the carbon emission allowance allocation ratio should be used. During the second period, more adaptive and optimized policy guidance should be employed.

The forest harvest residue removal reduced the carbon stocks of litter and soil on average by 3% over the period from 2016 to 2100. The reduction was small compared to the size of the carbon stocks but significant in comparison to the amount of energy produced from the residues.

A particular benefit is that it can alleviate competition for land conventionally used for food and feed production. In this research, we investigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate from citrus waste, a byproduct of the citrus processing industry. The study represents the first life cycle-based evaluations of citrus waste biorefineries. Two biorefinery configurations are studied\u2014a large biorefinery that converts citrus waste into ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate, and a small biorefinery that converts citrus waste into biomethane, limonene and digestate. Ethanol is assumed to be used as E85, displacing gasoline as a light-duty vehicle fuel; biomethane displaces natural gas for electricity generation, limonene displaces acetone in solvents, and digestate from the anaerobic digestion process displaces synthetic fertilizer. System expansion and two allocation methods (energy, market value) are considered to determine emissions of co-products. Considerable GHG reductions would be achieved by producing and utilizing the citrus waste-based products in place of the petroleum-based or other non-renewable products. For the large biorefinery, ethanol used as E85 in light-duty vehicles results in a 134% reduction in GHG emissions compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles when applying a system expansion approach. For the small biorefinery, when electricity is generated from biomethane rather than natural gas, GHG emissions are reduced by 77% when applying system expansion. The life cycle GHG emissions vary substantially depending upon biomethane leakage rate, feedstock GHG emissions and the method to determine emissions assigned to co-products. Among the process design parameters, the biomethane leakage rate is critical, and the ethanol produced in the large biorefinery would not meet EISA\u2019s requirements for cellulosic biofuel if the leakage rate is higher than 9.7%. For the small biorefinery, there are no GHG emission benefits in the production of biomethane if the leakage rate is higher than 11.5%.

The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO2 equivalent. Units of CO2 equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks.MethodsCO2 equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG\u2019s global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO2 over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO2, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO2 equivalent today.Results and discussionA GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value.

A series of unanticipated convective rain cells impacted the site with the first rainfall in {approximately}90 days, and the initial 4-cm rainfall increased soil moisture from {approximately}0.01 to 0.06{percent} (vol/vol). Several chambers were operating prior to the events, and two were deployed over wet soils following rainfall. Rainfall resulted in an immediate and steep rise in ambient air Hg concentrations and soil Hg emissions which persisted for 12{endash}24 hours. Fluxes increased most quickly and to a greater degree over the wettest soils, and the rate of increase was related to chamber design and flushing rate. The flux response was also apparent in the micrometeorological data. In general, soil emissions increased by an order of magnitude following the rain, and reached levels {approximately}6 times above those at the same time the previous day. These fluxes were significantly correlated with temperature, radiation, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture. After drying for {approximately}40 hours, selected soil plots were manually irrigated with low-Hg-distilled water. Mercury emissions responded similarly across the threemore\u00a0\u00bb treated sites, uniformly increasing from {approximately}60 ng m{sup {minus}2} h{sup {minus}1} pretreatment to {approximately}650 ng m{sup {minus}2} h{sup {minus}1} posttreatment, which was a factor of {approximately}6 higher than adjacent control soils. Possible causes of the increases in flux include soil gas displacement, desorption of Hg{degree} by water molecules, and desorption of Hg(II) and subsequent reduction in solution. The kinetics of the flux response, combined with local soil and climatic conditions, suggest that Hg emissions were responding primarily to soil moisture and solar radiation. These data have interesting implications for the role of changing regional climates on biogeochemical cycling of Hg.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "7f45dffc7d118d519879e99a21d6df9253c73a60", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983333625", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-014-2904-x", "CorpusId": 23019632, "PubMed": "24788932"}, "title": "Improvement of health risk factors after reduction of VOC concentrations in industrial and urban areas", "abstract": "After reductions of fugitive and diffuse emissions by an industrial complex, a follow-up study was performed to determine the time variability of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the lifetime cancer risk (LCR). Passive samplers (3\u00a0M monitors) were placed outdoors (n\u2009=\u2009179) and indoors (n\u2009=\u200975) in industrial, urban, and control areas for 4\u00a0weeks. Twenty-five compounds including n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and terpenes were determined by GC/MS. The results show a significant decrease of all VOCs, especially in the industrial area and to a lesser extent in the urban area. The median outdoor concentration of benzene in the industrial area declined compared to the former study, around 85\u00a0% and about 50\u00a0% in the urban area, which in the past was strongly influenced by industrial emissions. Other carcinogenic compounds like styrene and tetrachloroethylene were reduced to approximately 60\u00a0%. VOC concentrations in control areas remained nearly unchanged. According to the determined BTEX ratios and interspecies correlations, in contrast to the previous study, traffic was identified as the main emission source in the urban and control areas and showed an increased influence in the industrial area.

The authors assess this industry at the aggregate level (Standard Industrial Classification 324), which includes establishments engaged in manufacturing hydraulic cements, including Portland, natural, masonry, and pozzolana when reviewing industry trends and when making international comparisons. Coal and coke are currently the primary fuels for the sector, supplanting the dominance of natural gas in the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1997, primary physical energy intensity for cement production (SIC 324) dropped 30%,from 7.9 GJ/t to 5.6 GJ/t, while carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption (carbon dioxide emissions expressed in tons of carbon per ton cement) dropped 25%, from 0.16 tC/ton to 0.12 tC/ton. Carbon dioxide intensity due to fuel consumption and clinker calcination dropped 17%, from 0.29 tC/ton to 0.24 tC/ton. They examined 30 energy efficient technologies and measures and estimated energy savings, carbon dioxide savings, investment costs, and operation and maintenance costs for each of the measures. They constructed an energy conservation supply curve for U.S. cement industry which found a total cost-effective reduction of 0.6 GJ/ton of cement consisting of measures having a simple payback period of 3 years or less. This is equivalent to potential energy savings of 11% of 1994 energy use for cement making and a savings of 5% of total 1994 carbon dioxide emissions by the U.S. cement industry. Assuming the increased production of blended cement in the U.S., as is common in many parts of the world, the technical potential for energy efficiency improvement would not change considerably. However, the cost-effective potential, would increase to 1.1 GJ/ton cement or 18% of total energy use, and carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 16%.", "year": 1999}]}
