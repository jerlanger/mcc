Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) may play a key role in mitigating these emissions without facing the same limitations in range and refueling time as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we assess the environmental impacts and costs of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system (FCS) for use in light-duty FCVs and integrate these results into a comparative evaluation between FCVs, BEVs, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).MethodsWe conduct a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost assessment for the current state of the technology and two future scenarios for technological development. We compile a detailed and consistent inventory for the FCS by systematically disassembling and integrating information found in cost studies. For the vehicle-level comparison, we use models to ensure that vehicle size, performance, and fuel consumption are unbiased between vehicle types and consistent with the scenarios for technological development.Results and discussionOur results show that FCVs can decrease life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 50\u00a0% compared to gasoline ICEVs if hydrogen is produced from renewable electricity, thus exhibiting similar emission levels as BEVs that are charged with the same electricity\u00a0mix. If hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, FCVs are found to offer no greenhouse gas reductions, along with higher impacts in several other environmental impact categories. A major contributor to these impacts is the FCS, in particular the platinum in the catalyst and the carbon fiber in the hydrogen tank. The large amount of carbon fiber used in the tank was also the reason why we found that FCVs may not become fully cost competitive with ICEVs or BEVs, even when substantial technological development and mass production of all components is assumed.ConclusionsWe conclude that FCVs only lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions than ICEVs if their fuel is sourced from renewable energy, as is the case with BEVs. FCVs are an attractive alternative to ICEVs in terms of vehicle performance criteria such as range and refueling time. However, the technological challenges associated with reducing other environmental impacts and costs of FCVs seem to be as large, if not larger, than those associated with the\u00a0capacity and costs of batteries for BEVs\u2014even when not taking into account the efforts required to build a hydrogen infrastructure network for road transportation.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "7507729c327397438f708249e72fe490196d86e0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2013252630", "DOI": "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0976(199805/06)8:3<94::AID-EET154>3.0.CO;2-Y", "CorpusId": 153989651}, "title": "Swiss energy taxation options to curb CO2 emissions", "abstract": "This study offers insights into the design of economically efficient policies to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Switzerland and in other European countries.

Twelve rumen-cannulated lactating cows were used in a replicated 4\u00d74 Latin square design (35-d periods) with a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cows were fed (ad libitum) RCS- or CS-based diets [forage:concentrate ratio 60:40; dry matter (DM) basis] without or with LO (4% of DM). Supplementation of LO to the RCS-based diet reduced enteric CH4 production (-9%) and CH4 energy losses (-11%) with no adverse effects on DM intake, digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, protozoa numbers, or milk production. The addition of LO to the CS-based diet caused a greater decrease in CH4 production (-26%) and CH4 energy losses (-23%) but was associated with a reduction in DM intake, total-tract fiber digestibility, protozoa numbers, acetate:propionate ratio, and energy-corrected milk yield. Urinary N excretion (g/d) decreased with LO supplementation to RCS- and CS-based diets, suggesting reduced potential of N2O emissions. Results from this study show that the depressive effect of LO supplementation on enteric CH4 production is more pronounced with the CS- than with the RCS-based diet. However, because of reduced digestibility with the CS-based diet, the reduction in enteric CH4 production may be offset by higher CH4 emissions from manure storage.

Wildfire simulation modelling was used to examine whether fuel reduction treatments can potentially reduce future wildfire emissions and provide carbon benefits. In contrast to previous reports, the current study modelled landscape scale effects of fuel treatments on fire spread and intensity, and used a probabilistic framework to quantify wildfire effects on carbon pools to account for stochastic wildfire occurrence. The study area was a 68 474 ha watershed located on the Fremont-Winema National Forest in southeastern Oregon, USA. Fuel reduction treatments were simulated on 10% of the watershed (19% of federal forestland). We simulated 30 000 wildfires with random ignition locations under both treated and untreated landscapes to estimate the change in burn probability by flame length class resulting from the treatments. Carbon loss functions were then calculated with the Forest Vegetation Simulator for each stand in the study area to quantify change in carbon as a function of flame length. We then calculated the expected change in carbon from a random ignition and wildfire as the sum of the product of the carbon loss and the burn probabilities by flame length class. The expected carbon difference between the non-treatment and treatment scenarios was then calculated to quantify the effect of fuel treatments. Overall, the results show that the carbon loss from implementing fuel reduction treatments exceeded the expected carbon benefit associated with lowered burn probabilities and reduced fire severity on the treated landscape. Thus, fuel management activities resulted in an expected net loss of carbon immediately after treatment. However, the findings represent a point in time estimate (wildfire immediately after treatments), and a temporal analysis with a probabilistic framework used here is needed to model carbon dynamics over the life cycle of the fuel treatments. Of particular importance is the long-term balance between emissions from the decay of dead trees killed by fire and carbon sequestration by forest regeneration following wildfire.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f435c0dd58f09d9317bef191f326bcf04d374560", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2074172803", "DOI": "10.1080/10962247.2015.1025925", "CorpusId": 205763297, "PubMed": "26079559"}, "title": "Sensor transition failure in the high flow sampler: Implications for methane emission inventories of natural gas infrastructure", "abstract": "Quantification of leaks from natural gas (NG) infrastructure is a key step in reducing emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), particularly as NG becomes a larger component of domestic energy supply. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires measurement and reporting of emissions of CH4 from NG transmission, storage, and processing facilities, and the high-flow sampler (or high-volume sampler) is one of the tools approved for this by the EPA. The Bacharach Hi-Flow Sampler (BHFS) is the only commercially available high-flow instrument, and it is also used throughout the NG supply chain for directed inspection and maintenance, emission factor development, and greenhouse gas reduction programs. Here we document failure of the BHFS to transition from a catalytic oxidation sensor used to measure low NG (~5% or less) concentrations to a thermal conductivity sensor for higher concentrations (from ~5% to 100%), resulting in underestimation of NG emission rates. Our analysis includes both our own field testing and analysis of data from two other studies (Modrak et al., 2012; City of Fort Worth, 2011). Although this failure is not completely understood, and although we do not know if all BHFS models are similarly affected, sensor transition failure has been observed under one or more of these conditions: (1) Calibration is more than ~2 weeks old; (2) firmware is out of date; or (3) the composition of the NG source is less than ~91% CH4. The extent to which this issue has affected recent emission studies is uncertain, but the analysis presented here suggests that the problem could be widespread. Furthermore, it is critical that this problem be resolved before the onset of regulations on CH4 emissions from the oil and gas industry, as the BHFS is a popular instrument for these measurements.

This vortex transports fuel vapor from the spray cone to the spark gap. This system allows a late injection timing and produces a well-confined mixture, which together provide an improved compromise between combustion phasing and combustion efficiency over typical wall-guided systems.

This represents a 4-7% reduction in fuel consumption compared with previous in-house stratified-charge DISI concepts, while providing similar stability and emissions performance. These benefits are shown to arise from improved combustion phasing, reduced unburned hydrocarbon emissions, and an enlarged window of stratified operation.

So far, this call for action has not materialized. This study provides updated estimates to these externality costs for the United States for the most recently available data, within the appropriate economic framework, and does so comprehensively through the use of multiple integrated assessment models and for several years. We show that damages in the agriculture sector are very high when compared to sectoral value added. This study provides a basis for further investigations on multiple fronts, such as a more detailed look at particular industries or on a smaller geographical scale. Emissions of most pollutants that result in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) formation have been decreasing in the United States. However, this trend has not been uniform across all sectors or regions of the economy. We use integrated assessment models (IAMs) to compute marginal damages for PM2.5-related emissions for each county in the contiguous United States and match location-specific emissions with these marginal damages to compute economy-wide gross external damage (GED) due to premature mortality. We note 4 key findings: First, economy-wide, GED has decreased by more than 20% from 2008 to 2014. Second, while much of the air pollution policies have focused to date on the electricity sector, damages from farms are now larger than those from utilities. Indeed, farms have become the largest contributor to air pollution damages from PM2.5-related emissions. Third, 4 sectors, comprising less than 20% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), are responsible for \u223c75% of GED attributable to economic activities.

Hence, sensitive recognition is crucial to avoid overintake of Cu(2+), and visual recognition is more favored for practical application. In this work, a dual-emission ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe was developed possessing the required intensity ratio, which can facilitate the sensitive identification of Cu(2+) by the naked eye. The probe hybridizes two fluorescence nanodots (quantum dots (QDs) and carbon dots (CDs)). Although both of them can be viable fluorescence probes for metal ion detection, rarely research has coupled this two different kinds of fluorescence material in one nanosensor to fabricate a selectively ratiometric fluorescence probe for intracellular imaging. The red emitting CdTe/CdS QDs were capped around the silica microsphere to serve as the response signal label, and the blue-emitting CDs, which is insensitive to the analyte, were covalently attached to the QDs surface to act as the reference signal. This core-satellite hybrid sphere not only improves the stability and brightness of QDs significantly but also decreases the cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells tremendously. Moreover, the Cu(2+) could quench the QDs emission effectively but have no ability for reduction of the CDs emission.

A Reference scenario (no CO2 constraints post-2020) was analysed to allow for comparison. The key conclusions are as follows: (a) the achievement of negative emissions in the power sector via the use of biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) allows for much more limited decarbonization in the buildings and transport sectors; (b) CCS is also extensively used for decarbonization of the industrial sector; (c) because of the absence in the model of options for transport mode-switching and building fabric efficiency improvements, the transport and buildings sectors achieve relatively little abatement by 2050 \u2013 the inclusion of these options could considerably reduce the need for BECCS and the cost of abatement; (d) decarbonization of the EU\u2019s energy system by 2050 would increase energy system costs by 14% compared to a Reference scenario with no CO2 constraints; and (e) average EU-wide marginal CO2 abatement costs in Policy Success reach $300/tCO2 in 2050. Such a value is within the (wide) range of marginal carbon prices produced by comparable scenarios in other studies. Policy relevance The EU has set itself a target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, against 1990 levels. This will require a reduction of at least 80% in CO2 emissions from the energy system. This article, using results from the European TIMES Model (ETM-UCL), demonstrates that in the absence of significant decarbonization in the buildings and road transport sectors, substantial negative emissions in the power sector must be achieved, through as-yet unproven technologies (involving BECCS) . Therefore, a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions across all energy-using sectors is required if this outcome is to be avoided.

Among others, the study found that total telework-related CO2 emissions during the cooling season and SO2, NOX, and hydrocarbon emissions in both seasons appear to be lower than nontelework emissions for all modes of transportation (except for light rail with higher NOX emissions and urban transit buses with roughly equal NOX emissions in the heating season). Light rail also has higher telework N2O and CH4 emissions. However, given the uncertainties in the data, the differences may be negligible. Urban transit buses and commuter express buses were found to be associated with more telework than nontelework CO emissions in both seasons. For these two modes, telework PM10 emissions are higher in the cooling and about the same in the heating season than nontelework emissions. Natural gas-powered ferries have more telework PM10 emissions than nontelework emissions. The study also found that for low-frequency telework programs energy use impacts could overturn transportation-related emission reductions independent of the mode of transportation used.

The test object was a 9-liter, ethanol-fueled diesel engine from Scania equipped with turbocharger and aftercooler. A similar diesel engine from Scania, but running on ordinary Swedish diesel fuel, was used as a reference and a reminder of \"the state of the art.\" The tests involved two different ethanol fuels containing various ignition improvers, Beraid 3540 and rapeseed methyl ester. Test conditions for the engines were those specified in the European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The aftertreatment system reduced the emissions of HC, CO and NO\\dx, down to 0.15, 0.04 and 2.54 g/kWh, respectively, while the estimated particle mass was reduced by 67%. Actually, by using the DNO\\dx\\sT system, the engines became Euro IV engines regarding the emissions of HC, CO and NO\\dx. The ethanol-fueled engine without EGR, catalyst or DPF emitted approximately 1.6 times more formaldehyde and 9.8 times more acetaldehyde than the diesel engine. However, the emission of acrolein was only 0.47 times the emission of acrolein from the diesel engine. When the ethanol-fueled engine was equipped with DNO\\dx\\sT, a significant reduction of the emissions of aldehydes was obtained. The emissions of acrolein, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were reduced by 56%, 87% and 95%, respectively. An even higher reduction was observed when the system was connected to the diesel engine. Fifteen different hydrocarbons (alkanes, olefins and monoaromates) were also identified. The diesel-fueled engine, without any exhaust aftertreatment devices, emitted approximately twice as much hydrocarbon than the ethanol-fueled engine, also without any exhaust aftertreatment devices. However, there were also qualitative differences. Three hydrocarbons, namely propene, ethene and benzene, accounted for 77% of the hydrocarbons emitted from the diesel-fueled engine, while acetylene, ethene and benzene, made up only 53% of the hydrocarbons emitted from the ethanol-fueled engine. When connecting the system to the engines, a difference was observed; the reduction of analyzed hydrocarbon emissions was approximately 90% for the diesel-fueled engine, but only 47% for the ethanol-fueled engine. The studied aftertreatment system has been developed and optimized for the diesel-fueled engine. This fact is reflected in the powerful reduction of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, particles and NO\\dx that is obtained when connecting the system to the diesel-fueled engine. Nevertheless, a significant reduction is also obtained when connecting the system to the ethanol-fueled engine. Test results indicate that it should be possible to better optimize the system for the ethanol engine. It is also, probably, necessary to exchange the catalyst in the system.

The study was conducted using multiple data collection techniques, including interviews, production observation, firsthand experience, and online-search summaries.ResultsInspired by a full analysis of case studies, a hierarchical conceptual framework was developed to provide an overarching view of how existing apps achieve environmental benefits, which deepens our understanding of the interrelationship between freight Apps utilization and CO2 reduction. Freight apps provide a mechanism that auto-match the consignor\u2019s demand and the carrier\u2019s supply based on mobile Internet. The efficient way to find the right truck and complete the delivery process enhances the decrease of truck\u2019s empty travel distances and improvement of average vehicle loaded, then leading to an improvement of efficiency and a decline in carbon emission in freight industry. And then the identification of returning pick-up and route planning was conducted to further improve apps for CO2 reduction.ConclusionsThe influences to freight movement system by apps focused on reconstructing the demand and supply with integration technology, and resulted in a more efficient transaction using matching technology and advanced fleet management with optimization technology. When with inter-urban Full Truck Load, freight apps enable carriers to search for demand for returning a pick-up with decreasing empty running mileages, which then has environmental benefits through reducing CO2 emissions. However, when in urban Less-than-Truck Load, by strengthening the average vehicle utilization on laden trips, another determinant of route planning of delivery & collection reduced CO2 emissions. In order to further promote development of apps, in inter-urban Full Truck Load of long-distance transport, sufficient number of users and suitable matching conditions ensured carriers schedule an order to guarantee the return pick-up at an appointed time or grab several orders to achieve a larger non-empty return trip. In this \u201calways-laden\u201d transport plan, consideration should be given to the carriers\u2019 search and waiting costs before starting the next freight service.

Combining measurements of atmospheric CO 2 and its\nradiocarbon ( 14 CO 2) fraction and transport modeling in atmospheric\ninversions offers a way to derive improved estimates of CO 2 emitted from\nfossil fuel (FFCO 2) . In this study, we solve for the monthly FFCO 2 \nemission budgets at regional scale (i.e., the size of a medium-sized country\nin Europe) and investigate the performance of different observation networks\nand sampling strategies across Europe. The inversion system is built on the\nLMDZv4 global transport model at 3.75 \u2218 \u00d7 \u20092.5 \u2218 \nresolution. We conduct Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) and use\ntwo types of diagnostics to assess the potential of the observation and\ninverse modeling frameworks. The first one relies on the theoretical\ncomputation of the uncertainty in the estimate of emissions from the\ninversion, known as \u201cposterior uncertainty\u201d, and on the uncertainty\nreduction compared to the uncertainty in the inventories of these emissions,\nwhich are used as a prior knowledge by the inversion (called \u201cprior\nuncertainty\u201d). The second one is based on comparisons of prior and posterior\nestimates of the emission to synthetic \u201ctrue\u201d emissions when these true\nemissions are used beforehand to generate the synthetic fossil fuel CO 2 \nmixing ratio measurements that are assimilated in the inversion. With\n17\u00a0stations currently measuring 14 CO 2 across Europe using 2-week\nintegrated sampling, the uncertainty reduction for monthly FFCO 2 \nemissions in a country where the network is rather dense like Germany, is\nlarger than 30\u2009%. With the 43\u00a0 14 CO 2 measurement stations\nplanned in Europe, the uncertainty reduction for monthly FFCO 2 emissions\nis increased for the UK, France, Italy, eastern Europe and the Balkans, depending\non the configuration of prior uncertainty. Further increasing the number of\nstations or the sampling frequency improves the uncertainty reduction (up to\n40 to 70\u2009%) in high emitting regions, but the performance of the\ninversion remains limited over low-emitting regions, even assuming a dense\nobservation network covering the whole of Europe. This study also shows that\nboth the theoretical uncertainty reduction (and resulting posterior\nuncertainty) from the inversion and the posterior estimate of emissions\nitself, for a given prior and \u201ctrue\u201d estimate of the emissions, are highly\nsensitive to the choice between two configurations of the prior uncertainty\nderived from the general estimate by inventory compilers or computations on\nexisting inventories. In particular, when the configuration of the prior\nuncertainty statistics in the inversion system does not match the difference\nbetween these prior and true estimates, the posterior estimate of emissions\ndeviates significantly from the truth. This highlights the difficulty of\nfiltering the targeted signal in the model\u2013data misfit for this specific\ninversion framework, the need to strongly rely on the prior uncertainty\ncharacterization for this and, consequently, the need for improved estimates\nof the uncertainties in current emission inventories for real applications\nwith actual data. We apply the posterior uncertainty in annual emissions to\nthe problem of detecting a trend of FFCO 2 , showing that increasing the\nmonitoring period (e.g., more than 20\u00a0years) is more efficient than reducing\nuncertainty in annual emissions by adding stations. The coarse spatial\nresolution of the atmospheric transport model used in this OSSE (typical of\nmodels used for global inversions of natural CO 2 fluxes) leads to large\nrepresentation errors (related to the inability of the transport model to\ncapture the spatial variability of the actual fluxes and mixing ratios at\nsubgrid scales), which is a key limitation of our OSSE setup to improve the\naccuracy of the monitoring of FFCO 2 emissions in European regions. Using\na high-resolution transport model should improve the potential to retrieve\nFFCO 2 emissions, and this needs to be investigated.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "6e13df8e3effd3d391d11c18d24b9af4845294ab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2072824631", "DOI": "10.1039/B513279G", "CorpusId": 98343512}, "title": "Characterisation of a pulsed rf-glow discharge in view of its use in OES", "abstract": "Pulsed radiofrequency glow discharges are studied in view of their possible advantages for optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES).

For the agriculture sector to achieve reduced GHG emission, climate-smart activities and improved food security will be needed for this sector to become a climate-smart landscape. Climate-smart technologies are effective at targeting inputs to the fields, helping to lower greenhouse gas emissions. This article explores the key sources of carbon emissions within the agriculture sector and reviews efficient ways to GHG emission via Smart Farming technology. Based on the public archive GHG datasets, we have found that livestock farming is the largest GHG emission sector among other agricultural sectors and responsible for 70% of the total emission. Besides, we also show that Queensland is the largest agricultural GHG contributor compared to other states and territories. The article also captures any possible sources within smart farming that may contribute to carbon emissions and suggest ways to reduce GHG emissions.

The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals, fuels, and feedstocks has shown enough promise in the past decade to justify both academic and industrial sectors to increase efforts to better assess the potential economic and technical feasibility of the technology. Intensifying the process toward an industrial scale can be achieved by higher production rates, either by simply increasing the total area of catalyst in a reactor or by increasing the reaction rate (current density) for a given area of catalyst. Both approaches will be needed to economically produce an industrial quantity of product in a single plant (e.g., >100 tons product/day). In electrochemical CO2 reduction, however, increasing current densities to those needed for commercial operation (e.g., >200 mA/cm) requires researchers to use cell designs that can supply enough CO2 to the catalyst layer to fuel the reaction, as opposed to traditional H-cell reactors. For these reasons, more and more researchers have begun using catalysts deposited onto gas-diffusion layers (GDLs), where high concentrations of CO2 can be maintained in close proximity to the catalyst layer even at high reaction rates. GDLs can also reduce overall cell potentials by directly improving catalytic activity, while a more system-focused testing platform can help reduce major system losses such as ohmic heating.

How to define and categorize climate engineering options has been a recurring issue in both public and specialist discussions. We assert here that current definitions of mitigation, adaptation, and climate engineering are ambiguous, overlap with each other and thus contribute to confusing the discourse on how to tackle anthropogenic climate change. We propose a new and more inclusive categorization into five different classes: anthropogenic emissions reductions (AER), territorial or domestic removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (D\u2010GGR), trans\u2010territorial removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (T\u2010GGR), regional to planetary targeted climate modification (TCM), and climate change adaptation measures (including local targeted climate and environmental modification, abbreviated CCAM). Thus, we suggest that techniques for domestic greenhouse gas removal might better be thought of as forming a separate category alongside more traditional mitigation techniques that consist of emissions reductions. Local targeted climate modification can be seen as an adaptation measure as long as there are no detectable remote environmental effects. In both cases, the scale and intensity of action are essential attributes from the technological, climatic, and political viewpoints. While some of the boundaries in this revised classification depend on policy and judgement, it offers a foundation for debating on how to define and categorize climate engineering options and differentiate them from both mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change.

Data have indicated that agerelated decline occurs in multiple cognitive functions (e.g., speed of processing, attention, episodic memory), whereas others remain relatively well preserved (e.g., semantic knowledge). Given that cognitive processes depend on brain anatomy and physiology, previously observed behavioral changes in aging are likely intimately linked to changes in the integrity of cerebral architecture and function. As novel imaging techniques have been developed, application to age-related issues typically occurs shortly thereafter. For instance, over 60 years ago, cerebral blood flow in humans was assessed by having research participants inhale nitrous oxide and measuring the difference in nitrous oxide concentration in blood samples simultaneously collected with needles inserted in the femoral artery and in the jugular vein (Kety & Schmidt, 1945, 1948). The application of this technique to address age-related issues followed shortly thereafter (Freyhan, Woodford, & Kety, 1951; Kety, 1956), with authors suggesting that observed reductions in cerebral blood flow in older adults reflected neuronal loss. Despite these early attempts to link cerebral changes to aging, neuroimaging of aging studies have only recently proliferated, with the development of less invasive imaging techniques, leading to significant advances in cognitive aging research. Within the last 25 years, neuroimaging of age-related changes has typically correlated behavioral with structural neuroimaging measures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or resting functional neuroimaging measures, such as positron emission tomography (PET), which measures blood flow and metabolism. For example, cross-sectional structural MRI studies have revealed a negative relationship between age and hippocampal volume (for a review, see Raz, 2000), and age-related hippocampal atrophy has been typically associated", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "f59b241bba9704862033213832573ef5b5a9e343", "externalIds": {"MAG": "136866453", "CorpusId": 18975085}, "title": "Economic Evaluation of Emission Reductions of HFCs, PFCs and SF 6 in Europe", "abstract": "Preface On its way to its current form this report has received significant input from a considerable number of experts.

Although the largest decreasing trends in sunshine duration are found in major urban centers, in-depth analysis shows that the reductions are surprisingly uniform and well correlated among stations throughout Taiwan and her surrounding islands, implying that direct scattering by aerosols is not the major cause of the reductions. Similar reductions occur at two high altitude stations, namely Alishan (2.4 km) and Yushan (3.85 km), suggesting that the cause of the reductions is at altitude above 3.85 km. After eliminating other potential causes, we hypothesize that the trends are most likely caused by an increase in regional clouds and/or cloud albedo as a result of increased anthropogenic aerosols. The extent of the region depends on the season. Strong westerlies above 3.85 km in winter and spring imply that southern China, Southeast Asia, India and regions further upwind may suffer similar reductions and could be the major source of anthropogenic and fall, the wind pattern indicates Taiwan's own emissions of aero sols can play a significant role in the reduction.

Much of the housing was low-density with poor public transport links leading to doubts over its sustainability\u2014particularly in terms of energy use. Although the country is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels by the period 2008\u20132012, by 2005, emissions were already 25.4% higher than the baseline and current projections are that this figure will rise to 37% over the period. The residential sector is estimated to contribute to approximately 24.5% of energy-related CO2 emissions. This paper estimates total emissions from residential developments in the GDA constructed between 1997 and 2006.Materials and methodsCarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2) emissions are estimated using a life cycle assessment approach over a 100-year building lifespan and employing process, input\u2013output and hybrid energy techniques. Life cycle stages include: construction, operation, transport, maintenance and demolition. The main data sources include: national population and industry census data, household travel survey data, residential energy performance surveys and national accounts. The GDA was split into four zones each encompassing development at increasing radii from Dublin\u2019s city centre, namely: city centre, suburbs, exurbs and commuter towns.ResultsPer capita CO2 life cycle emissions in the GDA were found to be approximately 50\u201355% greater in the exurbs and commuter towns than in the city centre. Of the five life cycle stages studied, operational energy requirements (predominantly space heating and hot water, but including power) contributed most significantly to emissions (68%), followed by transport (17%), construction (9%) and maintenance/renovation (6%).DiscussionOperating emissions from dwellings in the commuter town and extra-urban zones were almost twice those in the city centre both due to larger dwelling sizes and the predominance of detached and semi-detached dwellings (with large amounts of exposed walls) in the former and the prevalence of smaller apartments in the latter. Car use was most pronounced in the zones furthest from the city centre where per capita emissions were almost twice those of residents in the city centre. Despite their smaller size, the per capita construction CO2 emissions of apartments were approximately one third greater than for low-rise dwellings due to the greater energy intensity of the structure. However, this difference was more than compensated for by the significantly lower operational emissions referred to above.ConclusionsIn 2006, recurrent CO2 emissions (operational, transport and maintenance) from dwellings built in the GDA over the ten preceding years were 2,108\u00a0kt while construction-related emissions in that year were 1,325\u00a0kt giving a total contribution from the residential sector of 3,434\u00a0kt CO2/annum\u2014representing 4.9% of national emissions for that year. Had the development policy prescribed \u2018city centre\u2019-type development and transport modes, then emissions for the year 2006 would have been 2,892\u00a0kt CO2\u2014a reduction of almost 16% over the actual figure.

In this paper, an efficient and low-complexity sidelobe suppression with orthogonal projection (SSOP) scheme is proposed. The SSOP scheme uses an orthogonal projection matrix for sidelobe suppression, and adopts as few as one reserved subcarrier for recovering the distorted signal in the receiver.

Reduction of cropland CH4 and N2O emissions is expected to mitigate climate change. However, large uncertainty remains in the assessment and prediction of these emissions, which prevents us from establishing appropriate mitigation options and strategies. The uncertainty is attributed mainly to the high spatiotemporal variability in emissions (e.g., emission spikes of N2O). Understanding and quantifying how hotspots of CH4 and N2O production in soil and then hot moments of their emissions occur would help reduce the uncertainty. This review focuses on soil\u2013plant systems, particularly the rhizosphere, as possible hotspots of production and consumption of CH4 and N2O. It is well known that the rhizosphere controls CH4 emission strongly, though each process of production and consumption remains to be quantified. On the other hand, surprisingly little attention has been paid to N2O, besides the fact that plant roots strongly control nitrification and denitrification. We review the current knowledge of cropland CH4 and N2O emissions, and conclude that soil\u2013plant interactions strongly affect cropland emissions of both gases, in which functions of plant roots affecting biogeochemical factors (e.g., availability of oxygen, labile organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen) in the rhizosphere and phenological changes are particularly important.

Existing measures to reduce emissions from industry are limited due to a combination of competitiveness concerns and a lack of technological options available to producers. In this paper, we assess the possibility of implementing a materials charge to reduce demand for basic industrial products and, hence, also reduce industrial emission levels. The modelling shows that a charge equivalent to around \u20ac80/tCO2 could reduce the EU\u2019s total (energy plus process) CO2 emissions by up to 10% by 2050, depending on the substitution options available. The materials charge could lead to small GDP increases and a minor reduction in overall employment levels. Key policy insights Full carbon price pass through along the materials value chain creates incentives for resource efficiency and substitution in the value chain of material use. Most macroeconomic models ignore mitigation opportunities in the value chain, as do carbon pricing mechanisms for industrial emitters, which largely mute incentives for mitigation opportunities with free allowance allocation. Including consumption at a benchmark level in emission trading systems reinstates a full carbon price incentive for all mitigation opportunities while avoiding competitive distortions and carbon leakage risks. Macroeconomic modelling shows that this allows for an additional 10% emission reduction accompanied by a slight GDP increase and employment reduction.

The color of the flame was found to change from yellow to blue to bluish-green to green over the range of conditions examined. In some cases a hybrid color flame was also observed. The recorded images of the flame photographs were analyzed using coloranalyzing software The results show that thermal and chemical flame behavior strongly depends on the air preheat temperature and oxygen content in the air. The flame color was observed to be bluish-green or green at very high air preheat temperatures and low-oxygen concentration. However, at high-oxygen concentration, the flame color was yellow. The flame volume was found to increase with increase in air-preheat temperature and decrease in oxygen concentration. The flame length showed a similar behavior. The concentrations ofOH, CH, and C 2 increased with an increase in air preheat temperatures. These species exhibited a two-stage combustion behavior at low-oxygen concentration and single-stage combustion behavior at high-oxygen concentration in the air. Stable flames were obtained for remarkably low equivalence ratios, which would not be possible with normal combustion air. Pollutant emission, including CO 2 and NO,, was much lower with highly preheated combustion air at low O 2 concentration than with normal air. The results also suggest uniform flow and flame thermal characteristics with conditioned, highly preheated air. Highly preheated air combustion provides much higher heat flux than normal air, which suggests direct energy savings and a reduction of CO 2 to the environment.

T-22 was able to solubilize MnO2, metallic zinc, and rock phosphate (mostly calcium phosphate) in a liquid sucrose-yeast extract medium, as determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. Acidification was not the major mechanism of solubilization since the pH of cultures never fell below 5.0 and in cultures containing MnO2 the pH rose from 6.8 to 7.4. Organic acids were not detected by high-performance thin-layer chromatography in the culture filtrates. Fe2O3, MnO2, Zn, and rock phosphate were also solubilized by cell-free culture filtrates. The chelating activity of T-22 culture filtrates was determined by a method based on measurement of the equilibrium concentration of the chrome azurol S complex in the presence of other chelating substances. A size exclusion chromatographic separation of the components of the culture filtrates indicated the presence of a complexed form of Fe but no chelation of Mn. In liquid culture, T. harzianum T-22 also produced diffusible metabolites capable of reducing Fe(III) and Cu(II), as determined by the formation of Fe(II)-Na2-bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid and Cu(I)-Na2-2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthrolinedisulfonic acid complexes. This is the first report of the ability of aTrichoderma strain to solubilize insoluble or sparingly soluble minerals. This activity may explain, at least partially, the ability of T-22 to increase plant growth. Solubilization of metal oxides by Trichoderma involves both chelation and reduction. Both of these mechanisms also play a role in biocontrol of plant pathogens, and they may be part of a multiple-component action exerted by T-22 to achieve effective biocontrol under a variety of environmental conditions.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "c8a06bcaee2c7d1c311b6f427dbc4369640f4253", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/BF03007363", "CorpusId": 32095618, "PubMed": "18984457"}, "title": "Reversible impairment of coronary flow reserve in takotsubo cardiomyopathy: A myocardial PET study", "abstract": "Background.

No fundamentally new insights and fundamentally new techniques have emerged over the last decade. \n\nHowever, in the last 10 years, the known techniques have been applied at a much larger scale in an increasing number of countries, the practical functioning of these techniques has improved, and costs have declined through learning effects. In several countries specialized contractors have taken over some of the activities (e.g., low-emission manure application), which has substantially reduced costs. \n\nFor the major sources of agricultural ammonia emissions (i.e., animal manure and urea fertilizer application), a range of emission control options is now proven in practice in more and more countries. Many of these measures are cost-effective, especially when additional synergistic effects are considered. \n\nModified animal feeding, covered slurry storages, low-emission manure and urea fertilizer application techniques are now cost-effective means in many situations. In particular, modified animal feeding can decrease NH3 emissions from all stages of the animal manure management chain, and, at the same time, decrease N2O emissions and odour. \n\nEmission reduction efficiencies and costs of these measures are sensitive against chosen reference system and depend on local factors, such as weather and soil conditions, differences in management practices and in the technical performances of abatement measures. Yet, in many countries, there is only limited experience with low-emissions techniques, due to technical, economical and cultural barriers that prohibit their implementation. Information and experience gained in other countries is often not readily accepted by farmers. However, in several cases technological and institutional experience has been successfully transferred between countries, resulting in lower costs than originally anticipated. \n\nWhile cost estimates of low-emission techniques remain uncertain for specific farms due to the inherent variability of important factors across farms, costs tend to be higher on small farms in countries with little experience, and lower on large farms in countries with lots of experience. \n\nThe report suggests concrete steps to incorporate these new developments into the GAINS integrated assessment model through modified definitions of mitigation options, adjusted data on emission removal efficiencies and applicabilities, and emission control costs.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a3ba1c834050540abf2e5874b0bdbf6981d5cbc5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2140353330", "DOI": "10.2478/ijnaoe-2013-0185", "CorpusId": 110439371}, "title": "Experimental investigation of frictional resistance reduction with air layer on the hull bottom of a ship", "abstract": "ABSTRACT In an effort to cope with recent high oil price and global warming, developments of air lubricated ships have been pursued to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to save fuel costs by reducing the frictional resistance.

With emerging access to high quality data, new methods are needed for informing transportation emissions assessment practitioners of the relevant vehicle and infrastructure characteristics that should be prioritized in modeling to improve the accuracy of inventories. The sensitivity of light and heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) and conventional air pollutant (CAP) emissions to speed, weight, age, and roadway gradient are examined with second-by-second velocity profiles on freeway and arterial roads under free-flow and congestion scenarios. By creating upper and lower bounds for each factor, the potential variability which could exist in transportation emissions assessments is estimated. When comparing the effects of changes in these characteristics across U.S. cities against average characteristics of the U.S. fleet and infrastructure, significant variability in emissions is found to exist. GHGs from light-duty vehicles could vary by -2%-11% and CAP by -47%-228% when compared to the baseline. For heavy-duty vehicles, the variability is -21%-55% and -32%-174%, respectively.

Exposure to heat waves is a function of the spatial distribution of physical events and the corresponding population distribution, and future exposure will be impacted by changes in both distributions. Here, we project future exposure using ensembles of climate projections that account for the urban heat island effect, for two alternative emission scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5) and two alternative population and urbanization (SSP3/SSP5) outcomes. We characterize exposure at the global, regional, and grid-cell level; estimate the exposure that would be avoided by mitigating future levels of climate change (to RCP4.5); and quantify the dependence of exposure on population outcomes. We find that climate change is a stronger determinant of exposure than demographic change in these scenarios, with a global reduction in exposure of over 50% under a lower emissions pathway, while a slower population growth pathway leads to roughly 30% less exposure. Exposure reduction varies at the regional level, but in almost all cases, the RCP remains more influential than the SSP. Uncertainty in outcomes is dominated by inter-annual variability in heat extremes (relative to variability across initial condition ensemble members). For some regions, this variability is large enough that a reduction in annual exposure is not guaranteed in each individual year by following the lower forcing pathway.

Three vehicles operated \"as-is\" on California Air Resources Board (CARB) specification diesel fuel and no emission control devices. Three vehicles were retrofit with Johnson Matthey CCRT\u00ae (Catalyzed Continuously Regenerating Technology) filters and fueled with Shell GTL Fuel. Two rounds of emissions tests were conducted on a chassis dynamometer over the City Suburban Heavy Vehicle Route (CSHVR) and the New York City Bus (NYCB) cycle. The CARB-fueled vehicles served as the baseline, while the GTL-fueled vehicles were tested with and without the CCRT filters. Results from the first round of testing have been reported previously (see 2004-01-2959). The second round results were compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel baseline. Over the CSHVR cycle, the GTL Fuel (no filter) reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO x ), hydrocarbon (HC), and particulate matter (PM) emissions by 13%, 46%, and 21%, respectively, and increased carbon monoxide (CO) by 11%. The GTL Fuel and the CCRT filter virtually eliminated the HC, CO, and PM emissions and reduced NO x emissions by 22%, a statistically significant reduction. Testing over the NYCB cycle also revealed emission reductions are possible with GTL Fuel. Compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel, the GTL Fuel provided statistically significant reductions in NO x , HC, and PM emissions by 11%, 58%, and 16%, respectively. A 10% increase in CO emissions was also noted, although not statistically significant. With the CCRT filter, the HC, CO, and PM emissions were reduced by over 95%. A statistically significant NO x reduction of 20% was observed. Reductions from round 2 were notably larger than those in round 1. To determine if the changes observed between rounds were \"real\", a statistical analysis was performed. The analysis found that CO emissions were higher without the filter in round 2, while no changes were observed for HC or PM emissions. The NO x emissions were significantly higher in round 1 for the NYCB cycle only. The fleet was followed for operability for 6 months and accumulated -20,000 miles.
