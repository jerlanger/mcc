The diverse nature of these models highlights large uncertainties in the likely development of fossil resource (coal, oil, and natural gas) consumption, trade, and prices over the course of the twenty-first century and under different climate policy frameworks. We explore and explain some of the differences across scenarios and models and compare the scenario results with fossil resource estimates from the literature. A robust finding across the suite of IAMs is that the cumulative fossil fuel consumption foreseen by the models is well within the bounds of estimated recoverable reserves and resources. Hence, fossil resource constraints are, in and of themselves, unlikely to limit future GHG emissions this century. Our analysis also shows that climate mitigation policies could lead to a major reallocation of financial flows between regions, in terms of expenditures on fossil fuels and carbon, and can help to alleviate near-term energy security concerns via the reductions in oil imports and increases in energy system diversity they will help to motivate.

To reverse this trend, the European Commission established a legal framework to improve the air quality. Thereby the Member States need to develop air quality plans (AQP) for zones and agglomerations where air quality limit values are exceeded, in order to implement pollution control strategies and meet the legal requirements. Understanding the reasons for the levels of air quality non\u2013compliance as well as evaluating available and commonly used tools to predict the air quality and their effects, is crucial for the decision\u2013making process on air quality management policies. Based on a compilation of regional and local AQP, a review of assessment capabilities and used modeling tools to evaluate the effects of emission abatement measures on the air quality and health was performed. In most cases, models are applied to estimate emissions and to assess the resulting air quality from both reference and emission abatement scenarios. Air quality\u2019s impacts on the health and environment are rarely quantified. Regarding the air quality assessment, beyond the modeling, monitored data for validation of simulations are also used. Some studies, however, do not include the use of air quality models, considering the monitoring network as spatially representative of the study domain (e.g. Lisbon Region, Riga, Malta). In order to overcome methodological limitations for quantifying the impacts of emission abatement measures, economic evaluation techniques or even Integrated Assessment Methodologies (IAM) have been developed.

As regards the Wastes of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), an appreciable increase of these materials has been noticed in the last decades, 117 \u00b7 103 tons of WEEE have been produced in Italy in 2002 according to Ecohitech [1] and the increase in this kind of waste is three times higher than that of the municipal waste according to the FISE ASSOAMBIENTE report [2]. Within WEEE, End-of-Life Cathode Ray Tube (EOL CRT) glass, the main part of TV sets and PC monitors, is here analysed using both a technical approach to establish a possible reuse of the glass in a open-loop recycling field (ceramic industry) and a methodology (LCA) capable of providing environmental evaluations.MethodsThe technological characterization was performed by chemical resistance tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-13), staining tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-14) with blue methylene and potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and surface abrasion tests (UNI EN ISO 10545-7). The LCA study was conducted using the SimaPro 5.0 software and Eco-Indicator 99 as an evaluation method.Results and DiscussionThe good technical results, reached by using cleaned EOL CRT panel glass inside a ceramic glaze formulation instead of a commercial frit, are supported by the environmental impact evaluation, which shows a decrease of the overall potential damage (measured in Points) of 36% and, in particular, a reduction of 53% in \u2018Human health\u2019, 31% in \u2018Eco-system quality\u2019 and 24% in \u2018Resources\u2019.ConclusionsThis study has demonstrated that this new, open-loop recycling strategy for the CRT glass significantly reduces the environmental impact of the ceramic glaze production process. In fact, in all damage categories examined in this study, there is a minor impact. An improvement is evident in the respiratory inorganics sub-category related to the lowering of dusts mainly and to a lesser amount with NOx and SOx in the climate change sub-category, due mainly to the reduction of CO2 emission correlated to the avoided combustion of the mixture which feeds melting furnaces in the frit production. Thus, the damage decrease in \u2018Ecosystem quality\u2019 is prevalently due to the lower NOx emissions by the kilns in the frit production that is evident in the acidification/eutrophication sub-category. Finally, the significant saving in the \u2018Resource\u2019 category is principally linked to the fossil fuels sub-category, thanks to the methane saving which stokes the melting furnaces.PerspectivesFurthermore, the decrease in CO2 emission (94.4%) evident in the climate change sub-category is a very important topic because it is in line with the Kyoto protocol (1997), where significant efforts have been exerted for the reduction of the green house gases emission, notably CO2. The CO2 emission is correlated to the combustion of the mixture which feeds melting kilns in the frit production, therefore the recycling of secondary raw materials, already in a glass state, can reduce the emissions of this gas. This reduction can be termed as environmental credit and it is an example of an allocation of environmental loads in a open-loop recycling, where waste from one industrial system are used as raw materials in another product system.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "1b98061a7067b4a32a6ee76e520e7660fb824ea9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030341310", "DOI": "10.1021/ES0208198", "CorpusId": 37844254, "PubMed": "12521181"}, "title": "Nitric oxide reduction in coal combustion: role of char surface complexes in heterogeneous reactions.", "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides are one of the major environmental problems arising from fossil fuel combustion. Coal char is relatively rich in nitrogen, and so this is an important source of nitrogen oxides during coal combustion. However, due to its carbonaceous nature, char can also reduce NO through heterogeneous reduction. The objectives of this work were on one hand to compare NO emissions from coal combustion in two different types of equipment and on the other hand to study the influence of char surface chemistry on NO reduction. A series of combustion tests were carried out in two different scale devices: a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled to a mass spectrometer and an FTIR (TG-MS-FTIR) and a fluidized bed reactor with an on line battery of analyzers. The TG-MS-FTIR system was also used to perform a specific study on NO heterogeneous reduction reactions using chars with different surface chemistry. According to the results obtained, it can be said that the TG-MS-FTIR system provides valuable information about NO heterogeneous reduction and it can give good trends of the behavior in other combustion equipments (i.e., fluidized bed combustors). It has been also pointed out that NO-char interaction depends to a large extent on temperature. In the low-temperature range (<800 degrees C), NO heterogeneous reduction seems to be controlled by the evolution of surface complexes.

The threshold fluence for ASE in the perovskite film is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude in the presence of the CLC reflector, which results in a factor of two reduction in threshold fluence compared to previous reports. We consider this to be due to improved coupling of the oblique and out-of-plane modes that are reflected into the bulk in addition to any contributions from cavity modes.

Profitability and net CO2 emissions reduction potential of such investments must be assessed by quantifying their implications within a future energy market context. Future energy market conditions are subject to significant uncertainty. One way to handle decision-making subject to uncertainty regarding future energy market conditions is to evaluate candidate investments using different scenarios that include future fuel prices, energy carrier prices, CO2 emissions associated with important energy flows related to industrial plant operations, etc. In this report, such scenarios are denoted \u201cenergy market scenarios\u201d. By assessing profitability for different cornerstones of energy market conditions, robust investment options can hopefully be identified, i.e. investment decisions that perform acceptably for a variety of different energy market scenarios. Energy market parameters within different scenarios must be consistent, i.e. different energy market parameters must be clearly related to each other (e.g. via key energy conversion technology characteristics and substitution principles). For constructing consistent scenarios, a calculation tool incorporating these interparameter relationships is essential. Hence, the Energy Price and Carbon Balance Scenarios tool (the ENPAC tool) was developed by the authors and is also presented in this report. The ENPAC tool calculates energy prices for a large-volume customer based on forecasted world market fossil fuel prices and relevant policy instruments (e.g. costs associated with emitting CO2, different subsidies favouring renewable energy sources in the electricity market or the transportation fuel market), and key characteristics of energy conversion technologies in the district heating and electric power sectors. Required user inputs to the ENPAC tool include fossil fuel prices and charge for emitting CO2 (other policy instruments can be included on an optional basis). Based on these inputs, the marginal technology for electricity generation can be determined by setting the technology with lowest cost of electricity production as build margin. The resulting build margin determines the electricity wholesale price together with CO2 emissions associated with marginal use of electricity. In the next step, the wood fuel market price is calculated based on the willingness to pay for a specified marginal wood fuel user category. The CO2 emission consequences of marginal use of biomass can thus also be determined, assuming that biomass is a limited resource. Finally, the willingness to pay for industrial excess heat in the district heating market is determined based on the identified price setting technology in a representative heat market. With this procedure, consistent future energy market prices can be determined. Moreover, CO2 emissions related to marginal use of the energy streams can also be determined. Using the ENPAC tool, eight energy market scenarios covering a time period from 2010 to 2050 have been developed for the EU energy market. The eight scenarios are a result of combining two levels of fossil fuel prices and four level of CO2 emissions charge. Two levels of fossil fuel prices represent different developments on the fossil fuel world market. Four levels of CO2 emission charge were chosen so as to reflect a wide spectrum of political ambitions to decrease CO2 emissions, ranging from weak to strong ambition levels. The ENPAC tool and the scenarios are developed for European conditions without taxes. Additional input may be required concerning taxes and policy instruments in order to reflect local conditions in specific markets.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ed6153cd82972be2aa4acf70ed9d5c55e297e6cf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044050378", "DOI": "10.1007/S003480000161", "CorpusId": 121840667}, "title": "Structural aspects of coaxial oxy-fuel flames", "abstract": "Abstract Oxy-fuel combustion has been proven to increase thermal efficiency and to have a potential for NOx emission reduction.

In order to achieve this goal, a prototype engine was installed in a passenger car and optimized to provide the lowest practical level of engine-out emissions. While this optimized calibration proved capable of meeting Euro 4 emission regulations for nitrogen oxides (NO x ) on an engine-out basis, a further reduction of 85% in both NO x and particulate matter (PM) emissions was necessary to meet the stringent Tier 2 Bin 5 emission levels.

The injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere to form an artificial stratospheric aerosol layer is discussed as an option for solar radiation management. The related reduction of radiative forcing depends upon the injected amount of sulfur dioxide, but aerosol model studies indicate a decrease in forcing efficiency with increasing injection rate. None of these studies, however, consider injection rates greater than 20 Tg(S) yr\u22121. But this would be necessary to counteract the strong anthropogenic forcing expected if \"business as usual\" emission conditions continue throughout this century. To understand the effects of the injection of larger amounts of SO2, we have calculated the effects of SO2 injections up to 100 Tg(S) yr\u22121. We estimate the reliability of our results through consideration of various injection strategies and from comparison with results obtained from other models. Our calculations show that the efficiency of such a geoengineering method, expressed as the ratio between sulfate aerosol forcing and injection rate, decays exponentially. This result implies that the sulfate solar radiation management strategy required to keep temperatures constant at that anticipated for 2020, while maintaining business as usual conditions, would require atmospheric injections of approximately 45 Tg(S) yr\u22121 (\u00b115 % or 7 Tg(S) yr\u22121) at a height corresponding to 60 hPa.

Given the large uncertainties regarding the potential risks associated with this degree of global warming, it would be more prudent to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations at or below current levels which, in turn, would require more than 20-fold reduction (i.e., \u226595%) in per capita carbon emissions in industrialized nations within the next 50\u2013100 years. Using the Kaya equation as a conceptual framework, this paper examines whether CO2 mitigation approaches such as energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and the development of carbon-free energy sources would be sufficient to bring about the required reduction in per capita carbon emissions without creating unforeseen negative impacts elsewhere. In terms of energy efficiency, large improvements (\u22655-fold) are in principle possible through aggressive investments in R&D and the removal of market imperfections such as corporate subsidies. However, energy efficiency improvements per se will not result in a reduction in carbon emissions if, as predicted by the IPCC, the size of the global economy expands 12\u201326-fold by 2100. Terrestrial carbon sequestration via reforestation and improved agricultural soil management has many environmental advantages, but has only limited CO2 mitigation potential because the global terrestrial carbon sink (ca. 200 Gt C) is small relative to the size of fossil fuel deposits (\u22654000 Gt C). By contrast, very large amounts of CO2 can potentially be removed from the atmosphere via sequestration in geologic formations and oceans, but carbon storage is not permanent and is likely to create many unpredictable environmental consequences. Renewable energy can in theory provide large amounts of carbon-free power. However, biomass and hydroelectric energy can only be marginally expanded, and large-scale solar energy installations (i.e., wind, photovoltaics, and direct thermal) are likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. Expansion of nuclear energy is highly unlikely due to concerns over reactor safety, radioactive waste management, weapons proliferation, and cost. In view of the serious limitations and liabilities of many proposed CO2 mitigation approaches, it appears that there remain only few no-regrets options such as drastic energy efficiency improvements, extensive terrestrial carbon sequestration, and cautious expansion of renewable energy generation. These promising CO2 mitigation technologies have the potential to bring about the required 20-fold reduction in per capita carbon emission only if population and economic growth are halted without delay.

To counteract the issue of driving economy, which is the only the driver can directly control, we propose a inattentive operating vibro-tactile notification system integrated into the car (safety belt or seating), helping the driver in his/her (i) subjective CO2 valuation and (ii) reduction of CO2 emissions while driving.\n Results from real driving experiments have shown that drivers tend to drive more economic with regard to carbon dioxide emission when perceiving tactile feedback about their current driving efficiency compared to baseline tests without technology assistance.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "80423ab36ac181ef520134bdda3407b79f8a0548", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2900896558", "DOI": "10.3390/SU10114329", "CorpusId": 158814659}, "title": "Considering Emission Treatment for Energy-Efficiency Improvement and Air Pollution Reduction in China\u2019s Industrial Sector", "abstract": "China has one of the most serious air quality conditions in the world, with the main energy consumption and air pollution emissions coming from its industrial sector.

To answer this question we design a set of first and second best scenarios to analyze the impact of early deployment of renewable energy technologies on welfare and emission timing to achieve atmospheric carbon stabilization by 2100. We use the global multiregional energy\u2013economy\u2013climate hybrid model REMIND-R as a tool for this analysis. An important design feature of the policy scenarios is the timing of climate policy. Immediate climate policy contains the mitigation costs at less than 1% even if the CO2 concentration target is 410\u00a0ppm by 2100. Delayed climate policy increases the costs significantly because the absence of a strong carbon price signal continues the carbon intensive growth path. The additional costs can be decreased by early technology policies supporting renewable energy technologies because emissions grow less, alternative energy technologies are increased in capacity and their costs are reduced through learning by doing. The effects of early technology policy are different in scenarios with immediate carbon pricing. In the case of delayed climate policy, the emission path can be brought closer to the first-best solution, whereas in the case of immediate climate policy additional technology policy would lead to deviations from the optimal emission path. Hence, technology policy in the delayed climate policy case reduces costs, but in the case of immediate climate policy they increase. However, the near-term emission reductions are smaller in the case of delayed climate policies. At the regional level the effects on mitigation costs are heterogeneously distributed. For the USA and Europe early technology policy has a positive welfare effect for immediate and delayed climate policies. In contrast, India looses in both cases. China loses in the case of immediate climate policy, but profits in the delayed case. Early support of renewable energy technologies devalues the stock of emission allowances, and this effect is considerable for delayed climate policies. In combination with the initial allocation rule of contraction and convergence a relatively well-endowed country like India loses and potential importers like the EU gain from early renewable deployment.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "df259d1ee50e111eea9e32ccd5062b05bb1637fa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974000108", "DOI": "10.1016/S0029-8018(01)00086-5", "CorpusId": 108697959}, "title": "Reduction of particulate matter and gaseous emission from marine diesel engines using a catalyzed particulate filter", "abstract": null, "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "4baa6e97836d9c3808102c0424b734aeb285a8b8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068072667", "DOI": "10.1021/JP908683X", "CorpusId": 97932339}, "title": "Heterogeneous Wet Chemical Synthesis of Superlattice-Type Hierarchical ZnO Architectures for Concurrent H2 Production and N2 Reduction", "abstract": "Two wet chemical methods, namely, wet etching (heterogeneous) and chemical precipitation (homogeneous), have been exploited for the formation of hierarchical ZnO architectures without any specific templates, catalysts, or capping agents.

We demonstrate an O2-assisted Al/CO2 electrochemical cell as a new approach to sequester CO2 emissions and, at the same time, to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy. We report on the fundamental principles that guide operations of these cells using multiple intrusive electrochemical and physical analytical methods, including chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and coupled thermogravimetric analysis\u2013Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. On this basis, we demonstrate that an electrochemical cell that uses metallic aluminum as anode and a carbon dioxide/oxygen gas mixture as the active material in the cathode provides a path toward electrochemical generation of a valuable (C2) species and electrical energy. Specifically, we show that the cell first reduces O2 at the cathode to form superoxide intermediates. Chemical reaction of the superoxide with CO2 sequesters the CO2 in the form of aluminum oxalate, Al2(C2O4)3, as the dominant product.

This paper describes tests carried out in a high-speed direct injection automotive diesel engine, during which the temperature of the piston was increased in a controlled manner between 189 and 227 \u00b0C while being continuously monitored. The aim of the work was to quantify the effects of piston temperature on pollutant exhaust emissions. The results show a significant reduction in unburned hydrocarbon emission, a significant increase in smoke emission, and no significant change in the emission of oxides of nitrogen. The increase in smoke emission cannot be ascribed to changes in the engine volumetric efficiency or air-fuel ratio. The paper demonstrates that fuel spray deposition on the piston surface was in the form of a thin film that did not experience bulk boiling.

In addition to providing the benefit of reducing total nitrogen concentrations in the effluent, this kind of WWTP upgrade has been demonstrated to reduce energy consumption and fossil CO(2) emissions. We show that the creation of a greenhouse gas (GHG) crediting system for the wastewater sector could provide a potentially sizable economic incentive on the order of $10 million to $600 million per year in the U.S. for upgrading of nitrifying WWTPs that results in N(2)O reductions, with an ancillary benefit of another $30-100 million per year from electricity savings. Even if biological nitrogen removal (BNR) treatment were mandated by existing and future water quality regulations, a GHG crediting system could still be created to promote BNR design and operation that drive N(2)O emissions below a baseline to even lower levels.

We measured BC in one of the fastest-warming and, at the same time, substantially understudied regions on our planet, the northeastern Siberian Arctic. Our observations, compared with an atmospheric transport model, imply that quantification and spatial allocation of emissions at high latitudes, specifically in the Russian Arctic, need improvement by reallocating emissions and significantly shifting source contributions for the transport, domestic, power plant, and gas flaring sectors. This strong shift in reported emissions has potentially considerable implications for climate modeling and BC mitigation efforts. Black carbon (BC) in haze and deposited on snow and ice can have strong effects on the radiative balance of the Arctic. There is a geographic bias in Arctic BC studies toward the Atlantic sector, with lack of observational constraints for the extensive Russian Siberian Arctic, spanning nearly half of the circum-Arctic. Here, 2 y of observations at Tiksi (East Siberian Arctic) establish a strong seasonality in both BC concentrations (8 ng\u22c5m\u22123 to 302 ng\u22c5m\u22123) and dual-isotope\u2013constrained sources (19 to 73% contribution from biomass burning). Comparisons between observations and a dispersion model, coupled to an anthropogenic emissions inventory and a fire emissions inventory, give mixed results. In the European Arctic, this model has proven to simulate BC concentrations and source contributions well. However, the model is less successful in reproducing BC concentrations and sources for the Russian Arctic. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that, in contrast to earlier studies, contributions from gas flaring (6%), power plants (9%), and open fires (12%) are relatively small, with the major sources instead being domestic (35%) and transport (38%). The observation-based evaluation of reported emissions identifies errors in spatial allocation of BC sources in the inventory and highlights the importance of improving emission distribution and source attribution, to develop reliable mitigation strategies for efficient reduction of BC impact on the Russian Arctic, one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "b9394fd083eae757c04d807baa2d501797583a9f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2888711580", "DOI": "10.54648/aila2018026", "CorpusId": 116373359}, "title": "How to Reconcile the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for Aviation with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)?", "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation Emissions (CORSIA), agreed in October 2016 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) established by the EU-ETS Directive.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2edceb5eb897c6e4594635ef64208c52df2de70b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980879206", "DOI": "10.1063/1.90030", "CorpusId": 120151248}, "title": "Accelerated step-temperature aging of Al/x/Ga/1-x/As heterojunction laser diodes", "abstract": "Double\u2010heterojunction Al0.3Ga0.7As/Al0.08Ga0.92As lasers (oxide\u2010striped and Al2O3 facet coated) were subjected to step\u2010temperature aging from 60 to 100\u2009\u00b0C.

Revenue neutrality, for example, can assuage public concerns about expanding government, but spending may be better than tax reductions for achieving some goals.

It is the method of choice in developing nations because it is the lowest cost disposal option. Indeed, most industrial nations, including many European Union countries and the USA, still rely on landfilling as an integral part of solid waste management infrastructure. The steady increase in per capita waste generation since the 1970s, and the total quantity of waste, has sustained and expanded the demand for waste disposal capacity and increased the potential for releases of landfill gas and leachate in the absence of properly designed, installed, and operated emission control measures. The amount and composition of municipal solid waste generated in a community depends on the levels and patterns of consumption. However, the quantity and quality of waste that finally enters the landfill is influenced by many factors including national waste management strategy, volume reduction measures, such as incineration, in place, and the availability and efficiency of waste recycling programmes. The latter is at a very low level (informal recycling excluded) in most developing nations, or due to lack of transparency, accurate data is not available. Informal recycling is the norm in several developing countries, particularly at the larger dumps serving urban areas. An estimated 2% of the urban population in Asia and Latin America depend on waste picking. There are about six million waste pickers in China, whereas the third largest economy in Asia, India, has one million people involved in waste picking. These informal waste pickers undeniably contribute directly towards the quantity and composition of waste that ends up in the landfill. When waste recycling rates are high, landfilled waste is mainly the organic component, as in India, whereas the recyclables are diverted for better income to middle men. Recycling undoubtedly would enhance the lifespan of landfills, since it is estimated that in Mexico, waste scavengers remove 10% of the waste, while in Bangalore (India) 15% of the waste is reduced due to recycling. Materials diverted away from landfills via recycling means resources are saved. Emissions from landfills, mainly landfill gas (LFG) and leachate, are directly related to the quantity and quality of waste disposed. Almost 65 to 80% of collected municipal solid waste is disposed of into landfills in developing nations. The bulk of the waste materials disposed of (40 to 70%) are organic in nature. As a consequence, landfills are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as at present 90% of the world\u2019s landfills are dumpsites without proper LFG collection systems. Indeed, landfills are considered the largest human-caused source of methane in the atmosphere. The methane fraction of LFG is a potent GHG as its global warming potential (GWP, 100 years horizon) is around 25 times higher than carbon dioxide. Thus, landfills are identified as a significant contributor to global warming. However, due to the growing international concern on climate change, the move from landfill-based to resource recovery-based waste management is becoming increasingly important. For example, anthropogenic methane emissions can be collected and used as fuel to generate electricity. Alternatively, organic wastes can be composted to produce a high-quality soil amendment that is valued by farmers and gardeners. These types of projects create both economic and environmental benefits for environmental sustainability. The sale of certified emission reduction (CER) credits [created through application of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention] can generate revenue streams that support waste emission reduction projects. Each CER is equivalent to 1 tonne of CO2, traded by industrialized countries to meet their emission reduction obligation under the Kyoto Protocol. However it is most likely that the installation of CDM LFG recovery projects in developing countries will come to a halt in 2013 when the Kyoto Protocol will end. Currently the number of CDM projects is declining due to the financial constraints in developed nations. Methane emissions from landfills can be estimated by using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology. Less than 5% of global GHG comes from the waste sector, of which landfill methane is the largest source. The IPCC has estimated that landfill methane will reach 795 Mt CO2e and 910 Mt CO2e in 2015 and 2020, respectively, out of approximately 300 Mt CO2e emitted by landfills and dumps in developing countries in south and east Asia. In developed countries, LFG emissions have been stabilized in response to stringent regulations, yet methane emissions are expected to continue increasing in developing countries as more waste goes to landfills that lack sufficient (and in some cases, any) emission control systems. Thus, mitigations are necessary to prevent or reduce GHG emissions from waste. Mitigation measures include LFG recovery, composting, recycling, incineration, mechanical\u2013biological treatment (MBT) and anaerobic digestion. Among the technologies, LFG recovery is widely implemented with more than 1150 plants worldwide. Emissions reduction of > 105 Mt CO2e from global renewable energy projects is believed to stabilize emissions from landfills.

At the heart of this discussion is the issue of crediting of emissions reductions. Projects can be correctly, over- or under-credited for their actual emissions reductions. We develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. In the context of a national carbon pricing scheme that includes offsets, we find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. In the presence of high predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions uncertainty or low carbon prices, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set at stringent levels, in some cases below 50 percent of predicted BAU emissions. As predicted BAU emissions uncertainty declines or as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, however, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. These results imply that to maintain environmental integrity of offsets programs, baseline stringency should be tailored to project characteristics and market conditions that influence the proportion of over-credited offsets to under-credited emissions reductions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "748fd85021057823c108908d5e368c23a474254b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2223459401", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1011112020621", "CorpusId": 130466544}, "title": "Heavy metal pollution and lake acidity changes caused by one thousand years of copper mining at Falun, central Sweden", "abstract": "One thousand years of mining of sulfurous ores at the Falun copper mine, central Sweden, and the resulting atmospheric emissions of metals and sulfur dioxide, gives a unique opportunity to study long-term responses to acid deposition.

There is increasing demand for measuring not only the concentration, but also the size distribution of the particulates. Laser-induced incandescence has emerged as a promising technique for measuring spatially and temporally resolved particulate volume fraction and size. Laser-induced incandescence has orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique, and thus offers the promise of real-time measurements and adds the increasingly desirable size and morphology information. The usefulness of LII as a diagnostic instrument for the precise measurement of particulate concentration and primary particle size has been demonstrated. Measurements have been performed in the exhaust of a single cylinder DI research diesel engine. Simultaneous gravimetric filter measurements were made for direct comparison with the LII technique. Quantitative LII is shown to provide a sensitive, precise, and repeatable measure of the particulate concentration over a wide dynamic range. LII and gravimetric measurements are shown to correlate well over a wide range of operating conditions. A novel method for determining the primary particle size is shown to be precise enough to distinguish particle sizes for different engine operating conditions, and subsequently the number density of primary particles was determined. LII has also been shown to be sensitive in differentiating the PM performance between four different fuels. The LII technique is capable of real-time particulate matter measurements over any engine transient operation. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII make it a potentially preferred standard instrument for particulate matter measurements. INTRODUCTION From an environmental perspective, there is an urgent need to decrease the total emissions from transportation engines. The undesirable exhaust emissions include CO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM). CO2 is a recognized greenhouse gas, and as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries have committed to reducing emissions of CO2. This can be primarily achieved by reductions in fuel consumption, and diesel engines offer the highest efficiency for road-going vehicles. The concession is that the emissions reduction systems for other pollutants are not as well developed for diesel engines as they are for spark-ignited engines. Demand for improved environmental performance has led to increasingly restrictive emission regulations for diesel-powered vehicles throughout Europe, North America, and Japan. Proposed regulations indicate that this trend to lower emissions levels will continue for the foreseeable future. Although PM is regulated for environmental reasons, from an operational point of view, particulate formation is not desirable. A significant portion of atmospheric particulates arises from combustion of fuels in various engines and furnaces. In urban areas, mobile sources are major contributors to ambient PM concentrations. The particulate emissions from diesel engines are in the form of complex aerosols consisting primarily of soot and volatile organics. For regulatory purposes, particulate matter emissions are defined as the mass of the matter that can be collected from a diluted exhaust stream on a filter kept at 52\u00b0C. This includes the organic compounds that condense at lower temperatures, but excludes the condensed water. This measurement provides the timeaveraged PM emissions over the period during which the particulates are collected on the filter, making measurements of the transient behavior of PM emissions impractical.

In a scenario with high demand for energy and land, being below 2\u2009\u00b0C with 50% likelihood requires a 50% reduction in emissions below 2000 levels by 2050, which is only barely feasible with known technologies in that scenario.

It can be achieved by using lignocellulosic biomass. However, there is also growing concern about its overall sustainability, especially regarding land use change, intensified use of agricultural inputs, and possible limitations on food security. Furthermore, the global energy demand is projected to grow over 50% by 2030. This will have an additional impact on the climate and, hence, on our planet. The recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen, Denmark, has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and is intended to reduce global emissions by at least 20% by 2020 and by 50%-60% by 2050 relative to the emission level in 2006.2 To achieve these ambitious goals in the near future, the next generation of chemicals and fuels from the biorefinery of lignocellulosic biomass has to be used sustainably, since the competition for raw materials between the food and energy industries prevents further (significant) increase of the current first-generation biofuels already on the market. Biomass, especially that which exists in the form of nonedible lignocellulosic materials such as grasses, woods (hard and soft), and crop residues (corn stover, wheat straw, sugar cane, bagasse, etc.), serves as renewable feedstock and could be considered as an alternative source of the chemicals and energy currently derived from petroleum. There are a number of technological breakthroughs necessary to reach a mature and cost-effective commercial technology for biomass utilization. Cost reductions in biological and chemical conversion are to be found in the improvement of individual process steps, far-reaching integration, the development of new efficient methods of carbohydrate conversions by alternative solvents or by robust microbial cell fermentation and by integration of all residues (e.g., spent lignins) and wastewaters into a one-pot process. Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The compositions of these materials vary, and their structures are very complex. Biomass requires many hydrolytic technologies and biological as well as chemical pretreatments to be reduced in size and have its physical structure opened.3 Various methods such as acid hydrolysis, hydrothermal or alkaline treatments, organosolv, solid (super)acids, ionic liquids, or subcritical or supercritical fluids can be employed.4 Carbohydrates constitute up to 75% of the annual production of biomass, estimated at 170 \u00d7 109 tons.5 Carbohydrates are an abundant, diverse, and reusable source of carbon. They find many industrial applications in such diverse areas as the chemistry, fermentation, petroleum production, food, paper, and pharmaceutical industries.6 Unfortunately, the * Fax: +351217163636.

In this paper, we will first present a complete nitrogen balance around the fluid catalytic cracking unit by using a circulating pilot plant with continuous regeneration. We will also discuss the transformation of nitrogen species during the cracking and catalyst regeneration process, which has direct implications on the formation and reduction of NOx in the regenerator.

This 2-yr field study involving commercial laying-hen houses in central Iowa was conducted to assess the effects of feeding diets containing EcoCal and corn-dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) on ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions. Three high-rise layer houses (256,600 W-36 hens per house) received standard industry diet (Control), a diet containing 7% EcoCal (EcoCal) or a diet containing 10% DDGS (DDGS). Gaseous emissions were continuously monitored during the period of December 2007 to December 2009, covering the full production cycle. The 24-month test results revealed that mean NH3 emission rates were 0.58 \u00b1 0.05, 0.82 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.96 \u00b1 0.05 g/hen/day for the EcoCal, DDGS, and Control diet, respectively. Namely, compared to the Control diet, the EcoCal and DDGS diets reduced NH3 emission by an average of 39.2% and 14.3%, respectively. The concurrent H2S emission rates were 5.39 \u00b1 0.46, 1.91 \u00b1 0.13, and 1.79 \u00b1 0.16 mg/hen/day for the EcoCal, DDGS, and Control diet, respectively. CO2 emission rates were similar for the three diets, 87.3 \u00b1 1.37, 87.4 \u00b1 1.26, and 89.6 \u00b1 1.6 g/hen/day for EcoCal, DDGS, and Control, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.45). The DDGS and EcoCal houses tended to emit less CH4 than the Control house (0.16 and 0.12 vs. 0.20 g/hen/day) during the monitored summer season. The efficacy of NH3 emission reduction by the EcoCal diet decreased with increasing outside temperature, varying from 72.2% in February 2009 to\u2009\u22127.10% in September 2008. Manure of the EcoCal diet contained 68% higher ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and 4.7 times higher sulfur content than that of the Control diet. Manure pH values were 8.0, 8.9, and 9.3 for EcoCal, DDGS, and Control diets, respectively. This extensive field study verifies that dietary manipulation provides a viable means to reduce NH3 emissions from modern laying-hen houses. Implications This work demonstrated that dietary manipulation can be used to reduce NH3 emissions from high-rise laying-hen houses with no adverse effect on the hen production performances (to be presented separately). The NH3 reduction rates could vary with different climates and hence geographic locations. The dietary manipulation to lower NH3 emissions should be applicable to all egg production systems. The results of this study also contribute to the baseline data for improving the national air emissions inventory for livestock and poultry production facilities.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a2d00e46719b33a13d0f517772be782243b7ea00", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2060363021", "DOI": "10.1016/J.BIOMBIOE.2011.04.041", "CorpusId": 2400607}, "title": "How to ensure greenhouse gas emission reductions by increasing the use of biofuels?: Suitability of the European Union sustainability criteria", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "218bfb0a00519a7009dc19bfcafcbeb58e39ad57", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2076057686", "DOI": "10.4155/cmt.12.58", "CorpusId": 154494939}, "title": "Technical energy efficiency, its interaction with optimal operating speeds and the implications for the management of shipping\u2019s carbon emissions", "abstract": "Background: A ship\u2019s energy efficiency can be improved and carbon emissions can be reduced using technology.

This was done by using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) modelling approach with data from trials using both standard soya-based broiler diets and reduced-protein diets with added protease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results for the feed production chain showed that there was a reduction in all environmental impact categories when protease was used in the diets. The biggest reduction occurred in the category of Global Warming Potential, mainly as a result of decreased carbon dioxide emissions from land use changes related to soya production. In the results for the broiler production chain, there were relatively bigger reductions in Eutrophication Potential and especially in Acidification Potential, mainly as a result of reduced feed protein content and subsequent nitrogen emissions from housing and manure management.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of protease in the broiler diets reduced the environmental impacts of both feed production and broiler production.
