The results show that labor productivity, energy intensity, and industry scale are the main factors affecting CO 2 emissions in the heavy industry. The improvement of labor productivity is the main cause of the increase in CO 2 emissions, while the decline in energy intensity leads to CO 2 emissions reduction, and the industry scale has different effects in different periods.

However, the role of these PAs in reducing carbon fluxes to the atmosphere from deforestation and their associated costs are still uncertain. To fill this gap, we analyzed the effect of each of 595 Brazilian Amazon PAs on deforestation using a metric that accounts for differences in probability of deforestation in areas of pairwise comparison. We found that the three major categories of PA (indigenous land, strictly protected, and sustainable use) showed an inhibitory effect, on average, between 1997 and 2008. Of 206 PAs created after the year 1999, 115 showed increased effectiveness after their designation as protected. The recent expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon was responsible for 37% of the region's total reduction in deforestation between 2004 and 2006 without provoking leakage. All PAs, if fully implemented, have the potential to avoid 8.0 \u00b1 2.8 Pg of carbon emissions by 2050. Effectively implementing PAs in zones under high current or future anthropogenic threat offers high payoffs for reducing carbon emissions, and as a result should receive special attention in planning investments for regional conservation. Nevertheless, this strategy demands prompt and predictable resource streams. The Amazon PA network represents a cost of US$147 \u00b1 53 billion (net present value) for Brazil in terms of forgone profits and investments needed for their consolidation.

For this purpose, the big region and grid-based Bayesian inversion methods are presented and compared. In the former setup, the monthly emissions over large geographical regions are quantified. In the grid-based setup, the fluxes are optimized at the spatial resolution of the model and on a monthly basis. Source-specific spatiotemporal correlations among errors on the prior emissions are introduced in order to better constrain the inversion problem. Both inversion techniques bring the model columns much closer to the measurements at all latitudes, but the grid-based analysis achieves a higher reduction of the overall model/data bias. Further comparisons with observed mixing ratios at NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory and Global Atmosphere Watch sites, as well as with airborne measurements are also presented.

The vegetation fire emission estimates decrease as well, from the prior 467 Tg CO/yr to 450 Tg CO/yr in the grid-based solution and 434 Tg CO/yr in the monthly big region setup, mainly due to a significant reduction of African savanna fire emissions.

We anticipate the emissions savings for the future car fleet in Great Britain until 2050 for various alternative futures, using a dynamic material flow analysis of ferrous metals and aluminium, and considering an evolving demand for car use. The results suggest that fostering vehicle weight reduction could produce greater cumulative emissions savings by 2050 than those obtained by incentivising a fast transition to electric drivetrains, unless there is an extreme decarbonization of the electricity grid.

It is widely expected that global emissions of atmospheric aerosols and their precursors will decrease strongly throughout the remainder of the 21st century, due to emission reduction policies enacted to protect human health. For instance, global emissions of aerosols and their precursors are projected to decrease by as much as 80 % by the year 2100, according to the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The removal of aerosols will cause unintended climate consequences, including an unmasking of global warming from long-lived greenhouse gases. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Climate Model version 3 (GFDL CM3) to simulate future climate over the 21st century with and without the aerosol emission changes projected by each of the RCPs in order to isolate the radiative forcing and climate response resulting from the aerosol reductions. We find that the projected global radiative forcing and climate response due to aerosol decreases do not vary significantly across the four RCPs by 2100, although there is some mid-century variation, especially in cloud droplet effective radius, that closely follows the RCP emissions and energy consumption projections. Up to 1 W m\u22122 of radiative forcing may be unmasked globally from 2005 to 2100 due to reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, leading to average global temperature increases up to 1 K and global precipitation rate increases up to 0.09 mm day\u22121. However, when using a version of CM3 with reduced present-day aerosol radiative forcing (\u22121.0 W m\u22122), the global temperature increase for RCP8.5 is about 0.5 K, with similar magnitude decreases in other climate response parameters as well. Regionally and locally, climate impacts can be much larger than the global mean, with a 2.1 K warming projected over China, Japan, and Korea due to the reduced aerosol emissions in RCP8.5, as well as nearly a 0.2 mm day\u22121 precipitation increase, a 7 g m\u22122 LWP decrease, and a 2 \u03bcm increase in cloud droplet effective radius. Future aerosol decreases could be responsible for 30\u201340 % of total climate warming (or 10\u201320 % with weaker aerosol forcing) by 2100 in East Asia, even under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP8.5).

Serial dilutions of the denitrifying strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 lacking the nosZ gene were inoculated into three different soils to modify the proportion of denitrifiers having the nitrous oxide reductase genes. The potential denitrification and N2O emissions increased when the size of inoculated C58 population in the soils was in the same range as the indigenous nosZ community. However, in two of the three soils, the increase in potential denitrification in inoculated microcosms compared with the noninoculated microcosms was higher than the increase in N2O emissions. This suggests that the indigenous denitrifier community was capable of acting as a sink for the N2O produced by A. tumefaciens.

Pollution levels will increase in the future due to growth in ship traffic and lack of effective regulations. So far, related research has been concentrated on emissions from land-based sources, and very few shipping emission inventories exist to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate emissions and the technical reduction potential of SO2, NOx, CO, HC and PM from waterborne traffic in Finland and in marine areas near Finland in 2000 and 2015. The energy consumption of ships in 2000 was estimated based on statistics mapping ship movements in the ports of Finland, Russia, Estonia and Sweden. Combined with emission factors, this data was used as a basis for evaluating the total amount of emissions. Emissions in 2015 were calculated based on predicted growth rates in ship traffic and four different reduction technology scenarios. In 2000 the ship-based SO2 and NOx emissions on sea routes totalled 36000 and 107000 tonnes, respectively. Current international regulations have little impact on emission rates in the studied marine areas. The required reduction technologies are internal engine modifications and fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1.5 %. The results of the scenario study show that ship-based SO2 and NOx emissions will increase by 20 % and 40 % respectively by 2015 if no further emission reduction methods are introduced. These emissions could be reduced significantly through introduction of more effective reduction technologies, such as lowering the sulphur content in fuel, adding water to the engine process, exhaust gas recirculation and selective catalytic reduction technology.

We demonstrate that substantive cooperative strategies are more likely to be pursued by firms that enter a VA close to its initiation, while symbolic cooperation is more likely behavior by late joiners. We show that late joiners and early joiners within VAs adopt different cooperative strategies because they face different institutional pressures. Our analysis is based on the strategies of firms participating in the Climate Challenge program (1995\u20132000) established by the U.S. Department of Energy and representatives of the national electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our results show that early joiners were subjected to higher levels of political pressure at the state level and were more dependent on local and federal regulatory agencies than late joiners were. Early joiners were also better connected to the trade association and more visible. Late joiners had undertaken significantly less investment in environmental improvements than early joiners. Our paper also illustrates the difficulty involved in using VAs to try to induce improved environmental outcomes when there are no sanctioning mechanisms. Although early entrants reduced their emissions more than nonparticipants, our results show no significant difference overall between participants and nonparticipants in the reduction of their emissions.

The prevalence of global cortical CMRglc reduction was higher in severely head-injured patients (86% versus 67% mild-moderate), although the absolute magnitude was similar across the injury severity spectrum (mean CMRglc 3.9 +/- 0.6 mg/100 g/min).

This new class of GFPs, termed deGPFs, results from substitution of wild-type residue 65 with threonine and residues 148 and/or 203 with cysteine. deGFPs display pK(a) values ranging from 6.8 to 8.0 and emission that switches from a green form (lambda(max) approximately 515 nm) to a blue form (lambda(max) approximately 460 nm) with acidifying pH. In this report we analyze in most detail the deGFP1 variant (S65T/H148G/T203C, pK(a) approximately 8.0) and the deGFP4 variant (S65T/C48S/H148C/T203C, pK(a) approximately 7.3). In the following paper [McAnaney, T. B., Park, E. S., Hanson, G. T., Remington, S. J., and Boxer, S. G. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15489-15494], data obtained by ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy can be described by a kinetic model that includes an excited-state proton-transfer pathway at high pH but not at low pH. Crystal structure analyses of deGFP1 at high-pH and low-pH conformations were performed to elucidate the basis for the dual emission characteristics. At low pH the structure does not contain a hydrogen bond network that would support rapid transfer of a proton from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to a suitable acceptor; hence blue emission is observed. At high pH, backbone rearrangements induced by changes in the associated hydrogen bond network permit excited-state proton transfer from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to the bulk solvent via Ser147 and bound water molecules, resulting in green emission from the anionic chromophore. Comparative analysis suggests that the basis for dual emission is elimination of the wild-type proton-transfer network by the S65T substitution, a general reduction in hydrogen-bonding opportunities, and a concomitant increase in the hydrophobic nature of the chromophore environment resulting from the cysteine substitutions. We evaluated the suitability of the deGFP4 variant for intracellular pH measurements in mammalian cells by transient expression in PS120 fibroblasts. The responses of deGFP4 and a commercially available pH-sensitive dye, SNARF-1, to changes in pH were compared in the same cells. Results show that the dynamic range of the emission ratio change is comparable between the two pH sensors over the range examined. Two-photon excitation was found to elicit a better deGFP4 fluorescent signal above cellular autofluorescence when compared to conventional confocal microscopy.

The major determinants of and actors involved in China's climate change policy are discussed, relating these to China's stance in global climate change negotiations. Energy is seen as the key to economic development and is one of the main causes for China's unwillingness to take on emission reduction commitments. Vulnerability to climate change is an emerging issue in China, and could contribute to elevating the climate change issue on China's domestic agenda in the future. Global climate change is still seen as a remote matter by the country's policy makers, and remains a foreign-policy issue. International pressure has not been able to change Beijing's stance of no commitments, although China is now an active participant in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which has become a way to apply an international mechanism on domestic problems and one of the channels that China itself prefers to use in its climate-change efforts. Key words: China, environmental protection-East Asia, sustainable development Introduction China is a key country in the international climate regime for two reasons. First, it is important in the global climate-change game due to its status as the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the United States. China's emissions are increasing steadily. Second, its status and influence in the G-77 of Third World states give it prominence in climate negotiations. As the world's largest developing country with an influential voice in the United Nations, China is set to play an important role in leading the developing world in the future climate regime. How then will China contribute to efforts to reduce global emissions? When will it take on emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol? In recent years, some optimism has been detected as China has engaged in dialogue in the negotiations. 1 Beijing's stance has, however, not changed: It still holds that the developed countries must take the main responsibility for past greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, I argue in this article that China is unlikely to take on commitments in the near future. I will demonstrate that prospects for emission reduction are not realistic under the current policy environment for several reasons. Moreover, the article discusses whether China is likely to leave the Kyoto Protocol altogether and pursue other alternative channels to reduce its emissions.2 I begin by analyzing the reasons why China continues to resist mandatory reductions-i.e., the major determinants for China's climate change policy-relating these to the country's stance in the global climate change negotiations. The article discusses the main actors involved in and responsible for China's climate change policy, and how their dominance influences China's climate change policy. China's climate policy is determined by both domestic and international considerations. Key domestic interests in this regard are economic development, energy issues, and perceived vulnerability. Understanding the domestic factors of China's climate policy has the potential to enhance and lead to more productive negotiations. China's stance in international negotiations is also influenced by foreign policy, where major issues are sovereignty, equity, and international image. The country's international standing and its wish to be seen as a respected member of the international community are important factors. These international and domestic issues will be discussed in the sections below. We will see how developments relate to both domestic and international climate policy by examining China's involvement in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). China is expected to become a major recipient of CDM investments. Due to the country's coal-based energy, there is great potential for projects in energy efficiency, energy conservation, fuel switching, and renewable energy. \u2026", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "dd9dde5ea9031da846de7c5de2b85c4ef3c2980e", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5309188", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-017-0072-2", "CorpusId": 52074310, "PubMed": "28413847"}, "title": "Greenhouse gas emissions from tropical forest degradation: an underestimated source", "abstract": "Background The degradation of forests in developing countries, particularly those within tropical and subtropical latitudes, is perceived to be an important contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impacts of forest degradation are understudied and poorly understood, largely because international emission reduction programs have focused on deforestation, which is easier to detect and thus more readily monitored. To better understand and seize opportunities for addressing climate change it will be essential to improve knowledge of greenhouse gas emissions from forest degradation. Results Here we provide a consistent estimation of forest degradation emissions between 2005 and 2010 across 74 developing countries covering 2.2 billion hectares of forests. We estimated annual emissions of 2.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, of which 53% were derived from timber harvest, 30% from woodfuel harvest and 17% from forest fire. These percentages differed by region: timber harvest was as high as 69% in South and Central America and just 31% in Africa; woodfuel harvest was 35% in Asia, and just 10% in South and Central America; and fire ranged from 33% in Africa to only 5% in Asia. Of the total emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest degradation accounted for 25%. In 28 of the 74 countries, emissions from forest degradation exceeded those from deforestation. Conclusions The results of this study clearly demonstrate the importance of accounting greenhouse gases from forest degradation by human activities. The scale of emissions presented indicates that the exclusion of forest degradation from national and international GHG accounting is distorting. This work helps identify where emissions are likely significant, but policy developments are needed to guide when and how accounting should be undertaken.

We estimate the impact of this policy on carbon dioxide emissions in the short and long run. These emissions depend on the market shares and the average emissions per kilometer of each car, but also on their manufacturing and the number of kilometers traveled by their owners. We first develop a simple tractable model that relates car choice and mileage. We then estimate this model, using both the exhaustive dataset of car registrations and a recent transportation survey which provides information on individual journeys. We show that if the shift towards the classes benefiting from rebates is spectacular, the environmental impact of the policy is negative. The reform has notably increased sales, leading to an important increase in manufacturing and traveling emissions.

Reducing emissions from petroleum production is of particular importance, as current transport fleets are almost entirely dependent on liquid petroleum products, and many uses of petroleum have limited prospects for near-term substitution (e.g., air travel). Better understanding of crude oil GHG emissions can help to quantify the benefits of alternative fuels and identify the most cost-effective opportunities for oil-sector emissions reductions (2).

We find that interactions with pre-existing taxes influence the costs of regulation and seriously militate against pollution abatement policies that do not raise revenue. If the marginal environmental benefits from pollution reductions are below a certain threshold value, any amount of pollution abatement through non-revenue-raising (NRR) policies like emissions quotas is efficiency-reducing. Under conditions approximating S02 emissions from electric power plants in the U.S., efficiency gains vanish if marginal environmental benefits are below $109 per ton and an NRR policy is employed. These results are largely independent of the size of the regulated sector relative to the overall economy and stem from two underlying effects. The tax-interaction effect is the adverse impact in factor markets arising from reductions in after-tax returns to factors associated with the higher production costs caused by environmental regulation. This effect leads to significantly higher efficiency costs than what would apply in a first-best world with no pre-existing taxes. Revenue-raising regulations (taxes) enjoy a revenue-recycling effect that offsets much of the tax-interaction effect, but non-revenue-raising regulations (quotas) enjoy no such offset.For any target level of emissions reduction, the gross efficiency costs of quotas are higher than those of revenue-raising policies..

PM2.5 is significantly reduced in both scenarios (4 \u03bcg m\u22123; ~50%), with levels below the annual US EPA NAAQS of 12 \u03bcg m\u22123 across all the NPs; visibility is also improved (10\u201315 dv; >75 km in visibility range), although some western US parks with Class I status (40\u201374 % of total sites in the US) are still above the 2050 planned target level to reach the goal of natural visibility conditions by 2064. We estimate that climate-driven increases in fire activity may dominate summertime PM2.5 over the western US, potentially offsetting the large PM2.5 reductions from domestic emission controls, and keeping visibility at present-day levels in many parks. Our study indicates that anthropogenic emission patterns will be important for air quality in 2050. However, climate and land use changes alone may lead to a substantial increase in surface O3 (2\u20133 ppb) with important consequences for O3 air quality and ecosystem degradation at the US NPs. Our study illustrates the need to consider the effects of changes in climate, vegetation, and fires in future air quality management and planning and emission policy making.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "13328983e30f08cef9996a930da3c8e03b9c9216", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2610603790", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.7b00369", "CorpusId": 30858244, "PubMed": "28467076"}, "title": "Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Water through Anchoring of a Molecular Ni Catalyst on CdS Nanocrystals.", "abstract": "Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into carbonaceous feedstock chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously store solar energy in chemical form.

These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100.

A large majority of Brazil's GHG emissions come from deforestation mainly of the Amazon biome for agriculture and livestock land uses. This unique inventory is now out of date. Thus, the aims of this review were (i) to update estimates of the GHG emissions for the Brazilian territory, (ii) to estimate the sinks to provide calculations of the GHG net emissions for the 1990-2005 period, (iii) to calculate the actual and estimate shares of agricultural and livestock activities, and (iv) to discuss in light of the new figures and patterns the best mitigation options for Brazil. Total emissions in CO2-eq increased by 17% during the 1994-2005 period. CO2 represented 72.3% of the total, i.e. a small decrease, in favour of non-CO2 GHG, in relation to 1994 when its share was 74.1%. The increase of all GHG excluding Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) was 41.3% over the period 1994-2005.

But in both cases Brazil increased in clearly lower values than the tendency calculated for China and India, two major emitters, with increases of 88.8% and 62.1%, respectively. Brazil's increase is less than those presented for some countries in Annex 1 that are submitted to a quota of reduction, e.g. Spain with 55.6% of increase and New Zealand with 45.8%. Brazil also is below the average increase shown by non-Annex I countries, estimated to be 61.3%, but above the world average (28.1%). Besides the effort to curb emissions from the energy and deforestation sectors, it is now a top priority to implement a national program to promote mitigation efforts concerning the agricultural and livestock sectors.

Impact of future technologies on scenarios until 2050", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0In this study the today's fleet-average emission factors of the most important ship exhausts are used to calculate emission scenarios for the future. To develop plausible future technology scenarios, first upcoming regulations and compliance with future regulations through technological improvements are discussed. We present geographically resolved emission inventory scenarios until 2050, based on a mid-term prognosis for 2020 and a long-term prognosis for 2050. The scenarios are based on some very strict assumptions on future ship traffic demands and technological improvements. The four future ship traffic demand scenarios are mainly determined by the economic growth, which follows the IPCC SRES storylines. The resulting fuel consumption is projected through extrapolations of historical trends in economic growth, total seaborne trade and number of ships, as well as the average installed power per ship. For the future technology scenarios we assume a diesel-only fleet in 2020 resulting in fuel consumption between 382 and 409 million metric tons (Mt). For 2050 one technology scenario assumes that 25% of the fuel consumed by a diesel-only fleet can be saved by applying future alternative propulsion plants, resulting in a fuel consumption that varies between 402 and 543 Mt. The other scenario is a business-as-usual scenario for a diesel-only fleet even in 2050 and gives an estimate between 536 and 725 Mt. Dependent on how rapid technology improvements for diesel engines are introduced, possible technology reduction factors are applied to the today's fleet-average emission factors of all important species to estimate future ship emissions. Combining the four traffic demand scenarios with the four technology scenarios, our results suggest emissions between 8.8 and 25.0 Tg (NO2) in 2020, and between 3.1 to 38.8 Tg (NO2) in 2050. The development of forecast scenarios for CO2, NOx, SOx, CO, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter is driven by the requirements for global model studies of the effects of these emissions on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and on climate.

In the absence of policy, the EPPA model projects a doubling of US greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Global emissions, driven by growth in developing countries, are projected to increase even more. Unrestrained, these emissions would lead to an increase in global CO2 concentration from a current level of 380 ppmv to about 550 ppmv by 2050 and to near 900 ppmv by 2100, resulting in a year 2100 global temperature 3.5\u20134.5\u00b0C above the current level.

Generic inventories are available for freight and passenger transport including air, rail, road, and water transport. The goal of freight transport modelling is to provide background data for transport services, which occur between nearly any two process steps of a product system. This paper presents and discusses the model structure, basic assumptions and results for selected freight transport services.Main Features Transport services are divided into several datasets referred to as transport components. In addition to vehicle operation (comprising vehicle travel and pre-combustion), infrastructure processes such as vehicle maintenance, manufacturing and disposal, as well as transport infrastructure construction, operation and disposal, are also modelled. In order to link the various transport components to the functional unit of one tonne kilometre (tkm), so-called demand factors are determined. In the case of transport infrastructure that is not exclusively used by freight transport, allocation is essential. The respective allocation parameters employed for line infrastructure construction/disposal and operation datasets (including land use) are yearly Gross-tonne kilometre performance (Gtkm) and kilometric vehicle/train performance.\nResults are presented for selected environmental exchanges related to gaseous emissions (climate change gases, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons), heavy metal (zinc and cadmium) emissions to soil and air, as well as BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and land use. Particle emissions are further distinguished into fine (PM2.5) and coarse (diameter between 2.5 and 10 \u00b5m) particles. The results presented comprise both an intra- and inter-modal comparison.Results and Discussions A comparison of Swiss and European rail transport reveals considerably lower emissions from Swiss rail transport due to the almost exclusive use of hydropower as traction energy. For gaseous emissions, freight transport by water or rail exhibits considerably better performance than road transport (65-92% less gaseous emissions). As far as zinc and cadmium emissions to soil are concerned, water and rail transport produce less than 1% of the emissions resulting from road transport for either pollutant. For zinc and cadmium emissions to air, road transport has the highest emissions; however, the emissions due to water and rail transport range from 2 to 18% of the emission levels arising from road transport. Particle emissions show a more diverse pattern. Whilst fine particle emissions due to water and rail transport are considerably lower than road transport, rail transport with respect to coarse particles performs worse than road transport. Dominance analysis reveals the importance of infrastructure processes. For instance, the NMHC-emissions of infrastructure processes account for 40%, 30% and 50% of emissions for road, rail and barge transport, respectively. For the demand factor of infrastructure operation, a sensitivity analysis of the employed allocation factor was performed, revealing no sensitivity for gaseous emissions and particles. On the other hand, considerable changes in both emission levels and in the ranking of transport modes is observed for land occupation. Finally, we varied selected operation parameters for road transport, resulting in considerable reductions of CO2 and NOX emissions of up to 60%. In one extreme case (load factor: 100%), NOx emissions for vehicle operation of a lorry are lower than for inland water transport. Only as a result of the considerably higher NOx emissions occurring in infrastructure processes does road transport score worse than water transport, with the ranking remaining the same as for the generic data presented in ecoinvent 2000.Conclusions and Perspectives The provided datasets allow for a preliminary screening of the importance of transport processes within a product life cycle. In the cases for which transport processes are identified as sensitive for the overall outcome of certain product life cycle or for transport specific comparisons, the modular structure and transparent documentation of demand factors allows for an easy and transparent integration of more case-specific data for selected transport components.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "dc807c0a231097db0250dbda618b61e06bbbee2c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1979908276", "DOI": "10.1007/BF03353898", "CorpusId": 154054554}, "title": "Energy technology changes and CO2 emission scenarios in China", "abstract": "With its recent rapid economic growth, China has become one of the foremost countries in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emission.

Here, we review sources and sink estimates and we present global 3D model calculations, showing that the main features of the global CH 4 distribution are well represented. The model has been used to derive the total CH 4 emission source, being about 600 Tg yr -1 . Based on published results of isotope measurements the total contribution of fossil fuel related CH 4 emissions has been estimated to be about 110 Tg yr -1 . However, the individual coal, natural gas and oil associated CH 4 emissions can not be accurately quantified. In particular natural gas and oil associated emissions remain speculative. Since the total anthropogenic CH 4 source is about 410 Tg yr -1 (\u223c70% of the total source) and the mean recent atmospheric CH 4 increase is \u223c20 Tg yr -1 an anthropogenic source reduction of 5% could stabilize the atmospheric CH 4 level. We have calculated the indirect chemical effects of increasing CH 4 on climate forcing on the basis of global 3D chemistry-transport and radiative transfer calculations. These indicate an enhancement of the direct radiative effect by about 30%, in agreement with previous work. The contribution of CH 4 (direct and indirect effects) to climate forcing during the past 150\u00a0years is 0.57W m \u22122 (direct 0.44W m \u22122 , indirect 0.13 W m \u22122 ). This is about 35% of the climate forcing by CO 2 (1.6W m \u22122 ) and about 22% of the forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases (2.6 W m \u22122 ). Scenario calculations (IPCC-IS92a) indicate that the CH 4 lifetime in the atmosphere increased by about 25\u201330%during the past 150\u00a0years to a current value of 7.9\u00a0years. Future lifetime changes are expected to be much smaller, about 6%, mostly due to the expected increase of tropospheric O 3 (\u2192OH) in the tropics. The global mean concentration of CH 4 may increase to about 2.55\u00a0\u03bcmol/mol, its lifetime is expected to increase to 8.4\u00a0years in the year 2050. Further, we have calculated a CH 4 global warming potential (GWP) of 21 (kgCH 4 /kgCO 2 ) over a time horizon of 100\u00a0years, in agreement with IPCC (1996). Scenario calculations indicate that the importance of the climate forcing by CH 4 (including indirect effects) relative to that of CO 2 will decrease in future; currently this is about 35%, while this is expected to decrease to about 15% in the year 2050.

These tools are evaluated in terms of consistency, complementarity, accuracy and robustness, and computational requirements using the 7\u201315 July 1995 O3 episode over the eastern United States. The NOx- versus VOC-sensitivity of O3 chemistry and relative role of chemistry and transport predicted by the three tools are qualitatively consistent, except that OSAT predicts an NOx-limited O3 chemistry at a few locations where both DDM and PA predict a VOC-sensitive O3 chemistry. DDM and OSAT agree well on the top 10 contributors to O3 formation, but they predict different rankings, with greater importance given to biogenic VOC emissions by DDM and greater importance given to surface anthropogenic NOx emissions by OSAT. The major difference in the DDM and OSAT predictions on the relative impact of sources is that DDM predicts both positive and negative sensitivities whereas OSAT always predicts positive contributions. Compared to the single-perturbation method (brute force method), DDM predicts accurate model responses under the 25% VOC or NOx emission reduction scenarios but inaccurate results under the 75% NOx emission reduction scenario. OSAT predicts accurate model responses under the 25% VOC emission reduction scenario, but inaccurate responses under the 25% and 75% NOx emission reduction scenarios. While these tools provide valuable and complementary information regarding O3 formation, each of them has limitations in terms of its design and application for the design of emission control strategies. DDM is suitable for such an application for small-to-moderate emission reductions of <40%.

However, historic contamination still affects soils in many areas and may have impacts for decades or even centuries afterwards.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c2ed77db21ab79ce28dde06b1a5b76c0b266c496", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1965324518", "DOI": "10.1021/ar9001747", "CorpusId": 5316698, "PubMed": "19795831"}, "title": "Room-temperature ionic liquids and composite materials: platform technologies for CO(2) capture.", "abstract": "Clean energy production has become one of the most prominent global issues of the early 21st century, prompting social, economic, and scientific debates regarding energy usage, energy sources, and sustainable energy strategies. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide (CO(2)), figures prominently in the discussions on the future of global energy policy. Billions of tons of annual CO(2) emissions are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion to generate electricity. Producing clean energy from abundant sources such as coal will require a massive infrastructure and highly efficient capture technologies to curb CO(2) emissions. Current technologies for CO(2) removal from other gases, such as those used in natural gas sweetening, are also capable of capturing CO(2) from power plant emissions. Aqueous amine processes are found in the vast majority of natural gas sweetening operations in the United States. However, conventional aqueous amine processes are highly energy intensive; their implementation for postcombustion CO(2) capture from power plant emissions would drastically cut plant output and efficiency. Membranes, another technology used in natural gas sweetening, have been proposed as an alternative mechanism for CO(2) capture from flue gas. Although membranes offer a potentially less energy-intensive approach, their development and industrial implementation lags far behind that of amine processes. Thus, to minimize the impact of postcombustion CO(2) capture on the economics of energy production, advances are needed in both of these areas. In this Account, we review our recent research devoted to absorptive processes and membranes. Specifically, we have explored the use of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in absorptive and membrane technologies for CO(2) capture. RTILs present a highly versatile and tunable platform for the development of new processes and materials aimed at the capture of CO(2) from power plant flue gas and in natural gas sweetening. The desirable properties of RTIL solvents, such as negligible vapor pressures, thermal stability, and a large liquid range, make them interesting candidates as new materials in well-known CO(2) capture processes. Here, we focus on the use of RTILs (1) as absorbents, including in combination with amines, and (2) in the design of polymer membranes. RTIL amine solvents have many potential advantages over aqueous amines, and the versatile chemistry of imidazolium-based RTILs also allows for the generation of new types of CO(2)-selective polymer membranes. RTIL and RTIL-based composites can compete with, or improve upon, current technologies. Moreover, owing to our experience in this area, we are developing new imidazolium-based polymer architectures and thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals as highly tailorable materials based on and capable of interacting with RTILs.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "0e13029593139a3cdf5e37ad38cc6fdde0cedd72", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2467401423", "CorpusId": 101102623}, "title": "Microbial Methane Oxidation for the Reduction of Landfill Gas Emissions", "abstract": null, "year": 1999}]}
