Using air pollution models, including emission and dispersion models, has been proposed as a logical solution to overcome problems such as expensive measurement methods and in some cases, difficulty and impossibility of direct measurements. In this paper, IVE emission model was used for estimating emission amounts and emission factors of taxi fleet of Imam Khomeini Street, one of main and busiest streets in Tabriz, as a representative street and for studying effects of different scenarios. AERMOD dispersion model was used for investigating the dispersion pattern of emitted pollutants from this fleet and to estimate the effect of using local base emission factors and replacement of present taxi fleet by environmental friendly vehicles in this city. CO, CH 4 , and NOx pollutants with quantities of 108, 20.7, and 5.4\u00a0g/km have the highest emission factor among all pollutants. Amount of hourly emissions per each pollutant, daily emission amount by technology types, and daily emission amount of each technology by pollutant types were also examined. CO emission has the highest amount at 7\u20138 in the morning, and at noon hours, emission of NOx and VOC increases. Technologies with old fuel injection and emission control systems and higher mileage have higher level of pollution emission. Investigating dispersion of pollutants from this fleet in the atmosphere shows pollutants movement in the northwest direction.

In the UK we have a formal target for the reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 80 per cent by 2050 (on 1990 levels). Official publications regularly suggest that reducing overall energy demand is an important part of meeting that target. Indeed, in a recent report of the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC, 2009, p. 22), it was suggested that residential energy efficiency measures could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tonnes per annum (or around 10 per cent of the UK's current total emissions) by 2022. The UK is not alone: many other countries have targets and aspirations for the reduction of energy consumption. Meanwhile, the future of energy demand will increasingly be synonymous with the future of electricity demand if the heat and transport sectors are electrified over the coming decades. Decarbonization of the energy sector is not just about reducing energy demand. Emissions from direct combustion of heat and direct combustion of liquid fuel in vehicles are roughly equal to emissions from power stations. Reducing emissions from electricity production is technically feasible via a combination of renewables, nuclear power and carbon-capture-and-storage equipment. This implies that switching heating and transportation demand for energy from combustion of fossil fuels to heat from electricity (or combined heat and power) and to electric vehicles is important in reducing emissions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "0eb2c3f94a0e96267b59435a6dba0149a2c44cd6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1993018562", "DOI": "10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.70.4071", "CorpusId": 23098547, "PubMed": "10054039"}, "title": "High radial confinement mode induced by dc limiter biasing in the HIEI tandem mirror.", "abstract": "A transition from low to high radial confinement mode is triggered by biasing a limiter in the HIEI tandem mirror.

The objective of this work is to simulate potential changes in the rainforest biome in Central America subject to anthropogenic climate change under two emissions scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The use of a dynamic vegetation model and climate change scenarios is an approach to investigate, assess or anticipate how biomes respond to climate change. In this work, the Inland dynamic vegetation model was driven by the Eta regional climate model simulations. These simulations accept boundary conditions from HadGEM2-ES runs in the two emissions scenarios. The possible consequences of regional climate change on vegetation properties, such as biomass, net primary production and changes in forest extent and distribution, were investigated. The Inland model projections show reductions in tropical forest cover in both scenarios. The reduction of tropical forest cover is greater in RCP8.5. The Inland model projects biomass increases where tropical forest remains due to the CO2 fertilization effect. The future distribution of predominant vegetation shows that some areas of tropical rainforest in Central America are replaced by savannah and grassland in RCP4.5. Inland projections under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show a net primary productivity reduction trend due to significant tropical forest reduction, temperature increase, precipitation reduction and dry spell increments, despite the biomass increases in some areas of Costa Rica and Panama.

Given the high cost of measuring methane production from individual beef cattle, genomic selection is the most feasible approach to achieve this reduction in emissions.

The required actual emission reductions for participating Annex B countries overall will be relatively small, as the United States do not intend to ratify the Protocol and significant amounts of carbon sequestered in domestic sinks will be credited to Annex B countries under Article 3.4 of the Protocol. In addition, there is a large potential supply of surplus emissions quota (hot air) from Russia and other economies in transition. This means that demand for certified emission reductions (CERs) from CDM projects will be relatively small. The magnitude of the CDM as a means for meeting Kyoto Protocol commitments, and individual countries' shares, will be influenced by a host of factors both on the demand and the supply side of the global carbon market. The analysis is based on a quantitative model of the global carbon market, based on marginal abatement cost curves and designed specifically for this type of analysis. We estimate required emission reductions in Annex B countries, the share of the Kyoto mechanisms in meeting this demand, the price for CERs, and the geographical distribution of CDM projects, and discuss distribution of sequestration projects. A ?low demand, low price? carbon market scenario appears likely, with intense competition between developing countries to attract CDM investors. Sensitivity analysis illustrates the likely direction and magnitude of impacts when key supply and demand parameters are changed. We examine the impact of higher or lower implementation and transaction costs, as well as expanding or contracting the supply of CERs through baseline and additionality rules. While the CDM could suffer a loss in competitiveness if transaction costs are too high, changes in CDM supply parameters do not fundamentally change estimates of CDM size and revenue. On the demand side by contrast there are there are a number of factors which could greatly reduce the size of the CDM, or even preclude commercially driven CDM projects altogether. Key factors that could harm the CDM are lower business-as-usual emissions growth in Annex B countries, higher supply of surplus emissions quota (hot air) from EIT countries, and possibly crediting under Article 3.4 of sequestration in agricultural soils. If however the United States participated in implementing the Kyoto Protocol, none of these factors would be a threat to a viable and sizeable CDM. We conclude that although the potential role for the CDM is seriously diminished under the Bonn agreement and without the United States on board, a significant amount of CDM projects in developing countries could still be achieved. Much will depend on international market factors, as well as the design of rules for CDM project implementation. The best strategy is to prepare to be competitive in a low-demand, lowprice market, and at the same time to strive for the United States to still come on board the Kyoto Protocol.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "e37a8b721beae2e7c8d1a1a4083b8c564c548d8d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2091517886", "DOI": "10.1143/JJAP.40.L744", "CorpusId": 118178608}, "title": "Lasing Characteristics of Low-Threshold GaInNAs Lasers Grown by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition : Optics and Quantum Electronics", "abstract": "We report on the lasing characteristics of low-threshold long-wavelength GaInNAs double quantum well (DQW) lasers grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).

The high photodegradation activity of the Bi/BiOCl nanocomposite can be ascribed to the presence of Bi metal, which can enhance the light absorption intensity, efficiently separate photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs, and accelerate the interfacial charge-transfer rate.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "6a040fd7ee88c7a7da3fb8368633fea734c1c9f1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2086994466", "DOI": "10.1021/ES8021655", "CorpusId": 27132975, "PubMed": "19368160"}, "title": "Mobile source CO2 mitigation through smart growth development and vehicle fleet hybridization.", "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a study on the effectiveness of smart growth development patterns and vehicle fleet hybridization in reducing mobile source emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) across 11 major metropolitan regions of the Midwestern U.S. over a 50-year period.

The analysis is based on a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario and on four carbon tax scenarios until 2050, developed using the WITCH model. Results show that the lowest level of taxation (starting at 10$ per tonne of CO2 in 2020) would reduce emissions in 2050 by 25% in China and by 30% in India, with respect to the BaU, at little cost. The marginal abatement cost curves are, however, steep and a higher level of taxation brings little emissions reductions at high costs. In China, only the two highest tax levels reduce emissions in 2050 below the 2005 level. In India, emissions in 2050 are higher than in 2005 even with the highest tax.

In the last few years, some field experiments have also shown its effectiveness in reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) losses from fertilized soils under conditions of low soil moisture. An incubation experiment was carried out with the aim of assessing the main biotic mechanisms behind N2O emissions once that the UIs N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamid (NBPT) and phenil phosphorodiamidate (PPDA) were applied with Urea (U) under different soil moisture conditions (40, 60 and 80\u00a0% water-filled pore space, WFPS).

Based on the results from this experiment, a WFPS (i.e. 60\u00a0%) was chosen for a second study (i.e. mesocosm experiment) aiming to assess the efficiency of the UIs to indirectly affect N2O emissions through influencing the pool of soil mineral N. The N2O emissions at 40\u00a0% WFPS were almost negligible, being significantly lower from all fertilized treatments than that produced at 60 and 80\u00a0% WFPS.

At 80\u00a0% WFPS, denitrification was the main source of N2O emissions for all treatments. In the mesocosm study, the application of NBPT+U was an effective strategy to reduce N2O emissions (75\u00a0% reduction compared to U alone), due to a lower soil ammonium (NH4+) content induced by the inhibitor.

Soil pH appears to exert a strong control on the N2O/N2 product ratio (high ratios at low pH), but the reasons for this are not well understood. To explore the possible mechanisms involved, we conducted an in-depth investigation of the regulation of denitrification in the model organism Paracoccus denitrificans during transition to anoxia both at pH 7 and when challenged with pHs ranging from 6 to 7.5. The kinetics of gas transformations (O2, NO, N2O, and N2) were monitored using a robotic incubation system. Combined with quantification of gene transcription, this yields high-resolution data for direct response patterns to single factors. P. denitrificans demonstrated robustly balanced transitions from O2 to nitric oxide-based respiration, with NO concentrations in the low nanomolar range and marginal N2O production at an optimal pH of 7. Transcription of nosZ (encoding N2O reductase) preceded that of nirS and norB (encoding nitrite and NO reductase, respectively) by 5 to 7 h, which was confirmed by observed reduction of externally supplied N2O. Reduction of N2O was severely inhibited by suboptimal pH. The relative transcription rates of nosZ versus nirS and norB were unaffected by pH, and low pH had a moderate effect on the N2O reductase activity in cells with a denitrification proteome assembled at pH 7. We thus concluded that the inhibition occurred during protein synthesis/assembly rather than transcription.

We then combine these results with national per capita emissions to quantify inequities arising from the distribution of cause (CO2 emissions) and effect (stress upon reefs) among coral reef countries.

Therefore, the timing of increased ambition is hugely important and as such this paper analyses the impact of both the short and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on global emissions and economic growth. Using the hybrid TIAM-UCL-MSA model we consider the achievement of a 2\u00b0C target against a baseline of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) while also considering the timing of increased ambition of the NDCs by 2030 and the impacts of cost reductions of key low-carbon technologies. We find that the rate of emissions reduction ambition required between 2030 and 2050 is almost double when the NDCs are achieved but not ratcheted up until 2030, and leads to lower levels of economic growth throughout the rest of the century. However, if action is taken immediately and is accompanied by increasingly rapid low-carbon technology cost reductions, then there is almost no difference in GDP compared to the path suggested by the current NDC commitments. Key policy insights Delaying the additional action needed to achieve the 2\u00b0C target until 2030 is shown to require twice the rate of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050. Total cumulative GDP over the century is lower when additional action is delayed to 2030 and therefore has an overall negative impact on the economy, even without including climate change damages. Increased ratcheting of the NDC commitments should therefore be undertaken sooner rather than later, starting in conjunction with the 2023 Global Stocktake.

This research studies in detail the entire emissions balance (and how it may be related to energy efficiency) in a newly built residential cluster project in Mancha Real (Jaen, Spain), and influences due to the choice of different urban typologies. For comparison, terraced housing and low-density, four-floor, multi-family housing alternatives have been studied. The present work assessed the life cycle of the building with the help of commercial software (CYPE), and the energy efficiency and emissions according to the legal regulations in Spain with the official software LIDER and CALENER VYP. After a careful choice of building and systems alternatives and their comparison, the study concludes that the major emissions impact and energy costs of urbanization and building activity occurs during construction, while later savings due to reductions in building use emissions are very modest in comparison.

The dynamic hydro-chemical Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) was used to predict the response of 163 Finnish lake catchments to future acidic deposition and climatic change scenarios. Future deposition was assumed to follow current European emission reduction policies and a scenario based on maximum (technologically) feasible reductions (MFR). Future climate (temperature and precipitation) was derived from the HadAM3 and ECHAM4/OPYC3 general circulation models under two global scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC: A2 and B2). The combinations resulting in the widest range of future changes were used for simulations, i.e., the A2 scenario results from ECHAM4/OPYC3 (highest predicted change) and B2 results from HadAM3 (lowest predicted change). Future scenarios for catchment runoff were obtained from the Finnish watershed simulation and forecasting system. The potential influence of future changes in surface water organic carbon concentrations was also explored using simple empirical relationships based on temperature and sulphate deposition. Surprisingly, current emission reduction policies hardly show any future recovery; however, significant chemical recovery of soil and surface water from acidification was predicted under the MFR emission scenario. The direct influence of climate change (temperate and precipitation) on recovery was negligible, as runoff hardly changed; greater precipitation is offset by increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures. However, two exploratory empirical DOC models indicated that changes in sulphur deposition or temperature could have a confounding influence on the recovery of surface waters from acidification, and that the corresponding increases in DOC concentrations may offset the recovery in pH due to reductions in acidifying depositions.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "8d399e6ae4d1863405f437e0bef1f6072f4ecbd8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2159205018", "DOI": "10.1007/S10640-006-9006-2", "CorpusId": 42578378}, "title": "Impacts of Novel Protein Foods on Sustainable Food Production and Consumption: Lifestyle Change and Environmental Policy", "abstract": "We analyse the impacts of a change in consumers\u2019 preference for Novel Protein Foods (NPFs), i.e. a lifestyle change with respect to meat consumption, and the impacts of environmental policies e.g. tradable emission permits for greenhouse gases (GHGs) or an EU ammonia (NH3) emission bound per hectare.

Our study leads to the following conclusions. Firstly, more consumption of NPFs assists in reducing global agricultural emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O) and NH3. However, because of international trade, emission reduction does not necessarily occur in the regions where more NPFs are consumed. Secondly, through lifestyle change of the \u2018rich\u2019, the emission reduction is not substantial because more \u2018intermediate\u2019 consumers will increase their meat consumption.

Porous gully plugs and filter strips showed no significant changes in pollution load or percent reduction. Grazing management, no-tillage, conservation tillage, and grazing management percent and load reduction in future scenarios varied at the field and watershed scales.

Indeed, the pattern of down-regulation of expression for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes coding for subunits of OXPHOS enzymes in the Alzheimer brain resembles the pattern of down-regulation in normal brain caused by chronic sensory deprivation. In both cases, down-regulation likely is mediated by changes in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory factors. Physiological down-regulation of OXPHOS gene expression in Alzheimer's is consistent with PET evidence that cognitive or psychophysical activation of mildly to moderately demented Alzheimer's patients can augment brain-blood flow and glucose metabolism to the same extent as in control subjects.

National annual total CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels are likely known to within 5\u201310\u202f% for most developed countries. However, uncertainties are inevitably larger (by unknown amounts) for emission estimates at regional and monthly scales, or for developing countries. Given recent international efforts to establish emission reduction targets, independent determination and verification of regional and national scale fossil fuel CO2 emissions are likely to become increasingly important. Here, we take advantage of the fact that precise measurements of 14C in CO2 provide a largely unbiased tracer for recently added fossil-fuel-derived CO2 in the atmosphere and present an atmospheric inversion technique to jointly assimilate observations of CO2 and 14CO2 in order to simultaneously estimate fossil fuel emissions and biospheric exchange fluxes of CO2. Using this method in a set of Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), we show that given the coverage of 14CO2 measurements available in 2010 (969 over North America, 1063 globally), we can recover the US national total fossil fuel emission to better than 1\u202f% for the year and to within 5\u202f% for most months. Increasing the number of 14CO2 observations to \u2009\u223c\u20095000 per year over North America, as recently recommended by the National Academy of Science (NAS) (Pacala et al., 2010), we recover monthly emissions to within 5\u202f% for all months for the US as a whole and also for smaller, highly emissive regions over which the specified data coverage is relatively dense, such as for the New England states or the NY-NJ-PA tri-state area. This result suggests that, given continued improvement in state-of-the art transport models, a measurement program similar in scale to that recommended by the NAS can provide for independent verification of bottom-up inventories of fossil fuel CO2 at the regional and national scale. In addition, we show that the dual tracer inversion framework can detect and minimize biases in estimates of the biospheric flux that would otherwise arise in a traditional CO2-only inversion when prescribing fixed but inaccurate fossil fuel fluxes.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "a662c285c0d85549eba30f1f12996845dd6fad8c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2006439885", "ArXiv": "1405.2038", "DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/26/27/275401", "CorpusId": 4873445, "PubMed": "24919038"}, "title": "Predicting failure: acoustic emission of berlinite under compression.", "abstract": "Acoustic emission has been measured and statistical characteristics analyzed during the stress-induced collapse of porous berlinite, AlPO4, containing up to 50\u2009vol% porosity. Stress collapse occurs in a series of individual events (avalanches), and each avalanche leads to a jerk in sample compression with corresponding acoustic emission (AE) signals. The distribution of AE avalanche energies can be approximately described by a power law p(E)dE = E(-\u03b5)dE (\u03b5 ~ 1.8) over a large stress interval. We observed several collapse mechanisms whereby less porous minerals show the superposition of independent jerks, which were not related to the major collapse at the failure stress. In highly porous berlinite (40% and 50%) an increase of energy emission occurred near the failure point. In contrast, the less porous samples did not show such an increase in energy emission. Instead, in the near vicinity of the main failure point they showed a reduction in the energy exponent to ~ 1.4, which is consistent with the value reported for compressed porous systems displaying critical behavior. This suggests that a critical avalanche regime with a lack of precursor events occurs. In this case, all preceding large events were 'false alarms' and unrelated to the main failure event.

The model reproduces the main features observed over Europe for {O}_{3}, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxides, as well as two events of enhanced {O}_{3} of North American origin over the eastern North Atlantic and over Europe. North American {O}_{3} fluxes into Europe experience a maximum in spring and summer, reflecting the seasonal variation in photochemical activity and in export pathways. In summer, North American {O}_{3} enters Europe at higher altitudes and lower latitudes because of deep convection, and because the flow over the North Atlantic is mostly zonal in that season. The low-level inflow is only important in spring, when loss rates in the boundary layer over the North Atlantic are weaker. Asian O3 arrives mainly via the westerlies, and usually at higher altitudes than North American O3 because of stronger deep convection over Asia. In addition, Asian O3 fluxes are at a maximum in summer during the monsoon period because of enhanced convection over Asia, increased nitrogen oxides sources from lightning and direct transport towards Europe via the monsoon easterlies. Over Europe, total background accounts for 30 ppbv at the surface. North American and Asian O3 contribute substantially to the annual O3 budget over Europe, accounting for 10.9% and 7.7%, respectively,while the European contribution only accounts for 9.4%. We find that in summer, at the surface, O3 decreases over Europe from 1980 to 1997, reflecting the reduction of European O3 precursor emissions.

In the reference scenario (business-as-usual), the emissions and the radiative forcing they cause would grow continuously. In the scenario of moderate emission reduction, the emissions would decrease annually by 1% from the first half of the next century. The radiative forcing would hardly decrease during the next century, however. In the scenario of strict emission reductions, the emissions are assumed to decrease annually by 3%, but the forcing would not decrease until approximately from the middle of the next century depending on the model used. Still, in the year 2100 the forcing would be considerably higher than the forcing in 1990. Due to the slow removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by the oceans, it is difficult to reach a decreasing radiative forcing only by limiting fossil CO2 emissions.The CO2 emissions from fossil fuels in Finland contribute to the global emissions presently by about 0.2%. The relative contribution of Finnish CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to the global forcing due to CO2 emissions is presently somewhat less than 0.2% due to relatively smaller emissions in the past.

We use a model to evaluate the user and agency costs as well as greenhouse gas benefit of design and operational improvements to transit systems. We examine how the operational characteristics of urban transit systems affect both costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

Passenger demand follows a many-to-many travel pattern with uniformly distributed origins and destinations. The approaches described could be used to optimize the network design of existing bus service or help to select a mode and design attributes for a new transit system. The results show that BRT provides the lowest cost but not the lowest emissions for our large city scenarios. Bus and LRT systems have low costs and the lowest emissions for our small city scenarios.

A new approach (known asGWP)has been suggested to compare contributions of longand short-livedGHGs, providing a close link between cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions and total warming.However, comparison factors for non-CO2GHGs under theGWPmetric depend on past emissions, and hence raise questions of equity and fairness when applied at any but the global level. The use ofGWPwould putmost developing countries at a disadvantage compared to developed countries, becausewhen usingGWP countries with high historical emissions of short-livedGHGs are exempted from accounting for avoidable futurewarming that is caused by sustaining these emissions.We show that when various established equity or fairness criteria are applied toGWP (defined here as eGWP), perceived national non-CO2 emissions vary by more than an order ofmagnitude, particularly in countries with highmethane emissions likeNew Zealand.We show that national emission estimates that useGWP are very sensitive to arbitrary choicesmade by countries and therewith facilitate the creation of loopholes whenCO2-equivalent emissions based on theGWP concept are traded between countries that use different approaches. In light of such equity-dependent accounting differences, GHGmetrics likeGWP should only be used at the global level.

The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO2 equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities.

In order to prevent heat-related illness, it is recommended that workers take breaks during working hours. However, this would lead to reductions in worktime and labor productivity. In this study, we estimate the economic cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks associated with climate change under a wide range of climatic and socioeconomic conditions. We calculate the worktime reduction based on the recommendation of work/rest ratio and the estimated future wet bulb glove temperature, which is an index of heat stresses. Corresponding GDP losses (cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks) are estimated using a computable general equilibrium model throughout this century. Under the highest emission scenario, GDP losses in 2100 will range from 2.6 to 4.0% compared to the current climate conditions. On the other hand, GDP losses will be less than 0.5% if the 2.0 \u00b0C goal is achieved. The benefit of climate-change mitigation for avoiding worktime loss is comparable to the cost of mitigation (cost of the greenhouse gas emission reduction) under the 2.0 \u00b0C goal. The relationship between the cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks and global average temperature rise is approximately linear, and the difference in economic loss between the 1.5 \u00b0C goal and the 2.0 \u00b0C goal is expected to be approximately 0.3% of global GDP in 2100.

The use of direct-fed microbials (DFM) is one possible option to decrease CH4 emission from ruminants. Direct-fed microbials are already used in ruminants mainly to increase productivity and to improve health, and are readily accepted by producers and consumers alike. However, studies on the use of DFM as rumen CH4 mitigants are scarce. A few studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown a CH4-decreasing effect but, to date, there has not been a systematic exploration of DFM as modulators of rumen methanogenesis. In this review, we explored biochemical pathways competing with methanogenesis that, potentially, could be modulated by the use of DFM. Pathways involving the redirection of H2 away from methanogenesis and pathways producing less H2 during feed fermentation are the preferred options. Propionate formation is an example of the latter option that in addition to decrease CH4 formation increases the retention of energy from the diet. Homoacetogenesis is a pathway using H2 to produce acetate, however up to now no acetogen has been shown to efficiently compete with methanogens in the rumen. Nitrate and sulphate reduction are pathways competing with methanogenesis, but the availability of these substances in the rumen is limited. Although there were studies using nitrate and sulphate as chemical additives, use of DFM for improving these processes and decrease the accumulation of toxic metabolites needs to be explored more. There are some other pathways such as methanotrophy and capnophily or modes of action such as inhibition of methanogens that theoretically could be provided by DFM and affect methanogenesis. We conclude that DFM is a promising alternative for rumen methane mitigation that should be further explored for their practical usage.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "36bf47612fefc136abbff88723fa6ab699f707f9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2214791712", "CorpusId": 110508328}, "title": "Reduction of Acoustical Noise Emission in AC-Machines by Intelligent Distributed Random Modulation", "abstract": null, "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "804a555c5f32db3d2cc1942cc5f95bce65d31d34", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2100615691", "CorpusId": 154966892}, "title": "Inter-linkages : The Kyoto Protocol and the international trade and investment regimes", "abstract": "In 1997 delegates to the third session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), agreed by consensus to adopt the Kyoto Protocol under which industrialized countries would reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2% from their 1992 levels.

During the impulsive phase we find that the emissivities of He I, He II and C IV in the transition region can be strongly enhanced above their expected equilibrium values, followed by a significant reduction which increases the amount of chromo- spheric plasma ablated into the corona. Furthermore, during the flare heating the overall charge state of the coronal ions can be significantly lower than is suggested by an equilibrium ionisation balance and, therefore, line ratio measurements will yield plasma temperatures that are much greater than the formation temperature of the emitting ion.

In this paper, we present a new method for segmenting transmission images in whole-body scanning. This reduces the noise in the correction maps while still correcting for differing attenuation coefficients of specific tissues. Based on the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm, the method segments the PET transmission images into a given number of clusters to extract specific areas of differing attenuation such as air, the lungs and soft tissue, preceded by a median filtering procedure. The reconstructed transmission image voxels are, therefore, segmented into populations of uniform attenuation based on knowledge of the human anatomy. The clustering procedure starts with an overspecified number of clusters followed by a merging process to group clusters with similar properties (redundant clusters) and removal of some undesired substructures using anatomical knowledge. The method is unsupervised, adaptive and allows the classification of both pre- or post-injection transmission images obtained using either coincident 68Ge or single-photon 137Cs sources into main tissue components in terms of attenuation coefficients. A high-quality transmission image of the scanner bed is obtained from a high statistics scan and added to the transmission image. The segmented transmission images are then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors to be used for the reconstruction of the corresponding emission scan. The technique has been tested on a chest phantom simulating the lungs, heart cavity and the spine, the Rando-Alderson phantom, and whole-body clinical PET studies showing a remarkable improvement in image quality, a clear reduction of noise propagation from transmission into emission data allowing for reduction of transmission scan duration.

In addition to CH\u2084 emission rates, seasonal patterns of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved CH\u2084 were determined in soil solutions of the root zone (soil surrounding rice roots) and the non-root zone (soil outside the root zone). Dissolved organic C in the root zone increased with plant growth and reached a maximum (16 to 21 mmol C L\u207b\u00b9) at 1 wk after flowering, whereas DOC in the non-root zone remained relatively low (1 to 5 mmol C L\u207b\u00b9). The increase of dissolved CH\u2084 concentrations was quicker and greater in the root zone (111 to 170 mol L\u207b\u00b9) as compared with the non-root zone (54 to 117 mol L\u207b\u00b9). Methane emission increased from 0 to 1.0 mmol CH\u2084 plant\u207b\u00b9 d\u207b\u00b9. From panicle initiation (PI) to maturation, the root zone DOC concentration was lower with NO\u2083-N application (8 to 13 mmol C L\u207b\u00b9) than with NH\u2084-N (13 to 21 mmol CL\u207b\u00b9). Similarly, NO\u2083-N application reduced dissolved CH\u2084 concentration as well as CH\u2084 emission. Anaerobic incubation showed that the inhibitory effect of NO\u2083-N addition on CH\u2084 production lasted only 2 wk. Thus, the inhibitory effect of NO\u2083-N seemed not fully accountable for the prolonged reduction in CH\u2084 production and emission in the fields. The root zone DOC that is enriched by plant-borne C appears to be a main source for CH\u2084 production and the lower DOC concentrations with NO\u2083-N application are accountable for the low CH\u2084 emissions.

In order to analyse the macroeconomic impacts, both an energy sectorial model and a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model have been used. During the year 2014 a carbon tax of 5 US$/tCO 2 e was approved in Chile. This tax and its increases (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 US$/tCO 2 e) are evaluated in this article. The results show that the effectiveness of this policy depends on some variables which are not controlled by policy makers, for example, non-conventional renewable energy investment cost projections, natural gas prices, and the feasibility of exploiting hydroelectric resources. For a carbon tax of 20 US$/tCO 2 e, the average annual emission reduction would be between 1.1 and 9.1 million tCO 2 e. However, the price of the electricity would increase between 8.3 and 9.6 US$/MWh. This price shock would decrease the annual GDP growth rate by a maximum amount of 0.13%. This article compares this energy policy with others such as the introduction of non-conventional renewable energy sources and a sectorial cap.

The purposes of this concise review of current literature are to (1) examine impacts on net GHG emissions and climate from increasing bioenergy production from forests and exporting wood pellets to Europe from North America, (2) develop a set of science-based recommendations about the circumstances that would result in GHG reductions or increases in the atmosphere, and (3) identify economic and environmental impacts of increasing bioenergy use of forests. We find that increasing bioenergy production and pellet exports often increase net emissions of GHGs for decades or longer, depending on source of feedstock and its alternate fate, time horizon of analysis, energy emissions associated with the supply chain and fuel substitution, and impacts on carbon cycling of forest ecosystems. Alternative uses of roundwood often offer larger reductions in GHGs, in particular long-lived wood products that store carbon for longer periods of time and can achieve greater substitution benefits than bioenergy. Other effects of using wood for bioenergy may be considerable including induced land-use change, changes in supplies of wood and other materials for construction, albedo and non-radiative effects of land-cover change on climate, and long-term impacts on soil productivity.

Sulfate likewise is a decisive predisposing factor influencing the eutrophication process by reducing N availability but increasing P availability and thus acting towards an N limitation of the primary production. This is one of the reasons why marine (coastal) waters and estuaries often exhibit N limitation with respect to primary production, while freshwater ecosystems often tend to exhibit P limitation.Within the N and P balance of agriculture of some countries of Western Europe (Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, FRG, UK and Sweden for N, resp. Netherlands, FRG and GDR for P) more the level than the efficiency of the N and P applications indicates the extent of the nutrient surplus. Despite 59\u201373% N utilization in plant production, the rate of 13\u201323% for agriculture as a whole equals to the 12\u201321% efficiency of N use in animal production. The varying N surplus in agriculture in the separate countries of 124 to 465 kg N ha\u22121 a\u22121 is determined almost exclusively by the level of the N application and not by its efficiency. The situation is similar for P: In spite of P utilization in plant production of 59\u201376%, P utilization in total agriculture is only 11\u201338%, or comparable to the P efficiency within animal production of 10\u201334%. The differing P excess balance of 55 to 88 kg P2O5 ha\u22121 a\u22121 is influenced by the level of the P application. The N and P efficacy of total agriculture hence is determined almost completely by that of animal production, since 83\u201395% (N basis) and 76\u201394% (P basis) of the total plant production (on top of the nationally varying levels of N and P use via imported feeds) are fed to animals \u2014 with the low N and P utilization cited above.Agriculture's share of the N and P emissions into surface water of several countries/regions in Western Europe (FRG, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway) ranges from 37 to 82% resp. 27 to 38%. Its share in the flus into the North Sea catchment basin will be about 60% for N and 25% for P related only to the anthropogenic material carried by the rivers. Agriculture's share in the atmospheric N emissions into the North and Baltic Seas can be estimated at about 65% or 55%, resp. while the remaining approx. 35% or 45%, resp. are traceable primarily to anthropogenic burning processes.For agriculture the priority lies in limiting N emissions into surface water caused by leaching, erosion and NH3 emissions, and reducing P emissions mainly through soil conservation (protection against erosion) and water protection. As regards N this means a demand for comprehensive protection of groundwater and atmosphere differentiated according to the potential for losses or the risk of losses on a site, also outside the protection zones. As regards P only those areas can be included in the demand for reduction of emissions that are actually threatened by erosion or surface runoff. Plenty of short-term and long-term measures are available to agriculture to reduce N and P emissions. Especially the long-range measures (such as creating nutrient balances on farms and fields, the integration of animal and plant production, maintaining maximum livestock densities according to the ability of areas to absorb nutrients, altered feeding programs in animal nutrition, changes in livestock keeping (slurry\u2192deep litter), increasing the internal and external recycling of N and P) are capable of bringing about a satisfactory degree of success within the next 20 to 30 years.", "year": 1990}, {"paperId": "d9af9e24f3953be8a6317fedae2293e49441ed98", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1990749396", "DOI": "10.1006/JMCC.1997.0567", "CorpusId": 9105208, "PubMed": "9441843"}, "title": "Small changes of cytosolic sodium in rat ventricular myocytes measured with SBFI in emission ratio mode.", "abstract": "The spectral properties of SBFI (sodium-binding benzofurzan isophthalate) were re-examined to arrive at a more specific and sensitive method to measure small changes of intracellular sodium ([Na+]i) particularly at low concentration.

Excitation of SBFI at 340 nm caused an exclusively sodium-dependent fluorescence from 400-420 nm, and hardly any change of fluorescence above 530 nm upon replacing sodium by potassium. Due to these spectral and quantum efficiency changes, SBFI excitated at 340 nm can be used in a dual emission ratio mode to measure [Na+]i. In dual emission ratio mode (410 and 590 nm, respectively), the fluorescence ratio increased by a factor of 13 upon replacing sodium for potassium.

The purpose of this article is, first, to provide a grounded understanding of the nature of the offset market, a tendency toward carbon neutrality as a possible point of equilibrium, and the ethical tensions that surround it from the perspective of the consuming public. Second, we outline the standards environment for offset providers to illustrate most effectively the need for a single set of criteria among providers that is readily understandable by the common consumer stakeholder. We then explore the differences among the providers and articulate the specific criteria upon which providers may be evaluated by this particular stakeholder constituency, by bringing together best practices based on currently available analyses. Finally, we share the results of preliminary data collection in connection with 117 offset providers and highlight early findings. These findings allow us comparing providers effectively and efficiently on a common scale that services both providers, who thereby have greater guidance for self-assessment purposes, as well as consumer stakeholders, who then have the ability to make useful and more informed choices about carbon emission reduction in the future.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "40a64d3af453e157ed3d1b619b6bed883cb77f48", "externalIds": {"MAG": "259731267", "DOI": "10.4324/9781936331437", "CorpusId": 221337281}, "title": "Climate Change Economics and Policy : An RFF Anthology", "abstract": "Preface Michael A.

A typical middle-sized HSRS building in a cold climate zone in China is studied. A detailed methodology was proposed for the development and assessment of emission reduction strategies through life cycle assessment (LCA), combined with a building information model (BIM). The results reveal that operational emissions contribute the most to total GHG emissions, constituting approximately 81% while embodied material emissions constitute 19%, with 94 kgCO2eq/m2\u00b7a and 22 kgCO2eq/m2\u00b7a respectively. Optimizing space can reduce operational GHG emissions and service life extension of insulation materials contributes to a 15% reduction in embodied GHG emissions. In all three scenarios, the reduction potentials of space, envelope, and material type optimization were 28.2%, 13.1%, and 3.5% and that measures for reduced life cycle emissions should focus on space in the early stage of building design. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the life cycle GHG emissions from HSRS buildings and reduction strategies to help influence the design decisions of similar projects and large space public buildings which are critical for emission reduction on a larger scale.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "a2845761a0f43800025b090df59e333cbf253b73", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2955318397", "DOI": "10.1201/B20723-9", "CorpusId": 54062894}, "title": "Application of Strategies for Particulate Matter Reduction in Urban Areas: An Italian Case", "abstract": "The paper describes the particulate matter pollution in a Northern Italian city: Varese.

While \u201cblanket coverage\u201d that includes all industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in an economy has some intuitive appeal, and seems equitable, it does not take into full account all the costs related to the extent of coverage. This paper shows that an alternative approach of \u201cpartial coverage\u201d based on benefit\u2013cost analysis can achieve the same emission reduction outcome at lower social cost. The approach is based on maximizing the benefits from inclusion of installations in an ETS at the same time as taking all relevant transaction costs into account. A broad definition of transaction costs is used, which covers the regulatory costs to the government as well as regulatory costs imposed on covered installations.

Compound 4 has two identical donors linked through the 2,7-position of N-substituted carbazole. These compounds absorb from UV to visible region and emit intensely from blue to green. The effect on the photophysical properties of these compounds by changing acceptors while keeping the donor and linker constant has been studied. A study of solvent effects on their photophysical properties has shown that an increase in polarity of the solvent causes a reduction of fluorescence quantum yields. With a decrease in temperature, these compounds showed increased emission intensity accompanied by a red shift of emission. Edge excitation red shift showed as much as 128 nm for compound 2 in isopropanol. Solid-state fluorescence quantum yields vary from 0.27 to 0.68 for these compounds. The fluorescence lifetimes of these compounds are solvent dependent. Compound 2 showed remarkable change in emission with concentration. Compounds 2 and 3 form highly stable fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) in tetrahydrofuran/water mixtures. The general and specific solvent effect on the emission properties of these compounds are investigated by Lipert-Mataga plots.

Postimplantation annealing at temperatures up to 1050 \u00b0C generally causes a partial recovery of measured CL intensities. However, CL depth profiles indicate that, in most cases, such a recovery results from CL emission from virgin GaN, beyond the implanted layer due to a reduction in the extent of light absorption within the implanted layer. In this case, CL emission from the implanted layer remains completely quenched even after such an annealing.

Strain relaxation in the microstructures as measured by Raman spectroscopy was not observed, arguing against theories of an increase in internal quantum efficiency due to a reduction of the piezoelectric field put forward by other groups. Optical microscope images show intense light emission at the periphery of the devices, as a result of light scattering off the etched sidewalls.

Possible improvements in electric and exergy efficiencies as well as specific emissions by recovering waste heat from the MT exhaust gases are determined. Different dry organic working fluids are considered during the evaluation (R113, R123, R245fa, and R236fa). In general, it has been found that the use of an ORC to recover waste heat from MTs improves the combined electric and exergy efficiencies for all the evaluated fluids, obtaining increases of an average of 27% when the ORC was operated using R113 as the working fluid. It has also been found that higher ORC evaporator effectiveness values correspond to lower pinch point temperature differences and higher exergy efficiencies. Three different MT sizes were evaluated, and the results indicate that the energetic and exergetic performance as well as the reduction of specific emissions of a combined MT\u2010ORC is better for small MT power outputs than for larger MTs. This article also shows how the electric efficiency can be used to ascertain under which circumstances the use of a combined MT\u2010ORC will result in better cost, primary energy consumption, or emission reduction when compared with buying electricity directly from electric utilities.

When no measurements are available, IPCC guidelines allow a default collection efficiency of 20% can be used for the methane generated on landfills with collection. However many Annex 1 countries estimate landfill gas collection to be much higher than 20%. This article reviews available information on collection efficiency. Collection efficiency depends on the phase of the landfill. During operation, a large part of the methane potential is generated. In the absence of a collection system, most is released to the atmosphere. In many cases, landfill gas collection only starts after closure and in this period collection efficiencies generally increases. High efficiencies are achieved, when the site is capped with an impermeable liner. For estimation of collection efficiencies, different landfill types should be distinguished: (a) closed landfills without gas collection; (b) capped landfills; (c) closed landfills with temporary cover and gas collection; (d) landfills in operation with and (e) landfills in operation without gas collection. For landfills with state of the art liners, collection efficiencies can be 90\u2013100%. For closed landfills, reported efficiencies range from 10\u201390%.

According to Amato et al., [3] the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of components arising from a number of emission sources (anthropogenic, but also natural) and atmospheric processes (secondary PM) which have a variable diameter in the range 0.01 \u03bcm100 \u03bcm.

This paper firstly used the LMDI (Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index) decomposition method to establish factors decomposition model on China's transportation carbon emission. Then, a quantitative analysis was performed to study the factors influencing China's transportation carbon emissions from 1991 to 2008, which are identified as transportation energy efficiency, transportation structure and transportation development. The results showed that: (1) The impact of transportation development on transportation carbon emissions showed pulling function. Its contribution value to carbon emissions remained at high growth since 1991 and showed an exponential growth trend. (2) The impact of transportation structure on transportation carbon emissions showed promoting function in general, but its role in promoting carbon emissions decreased year by year. And with the continuous optimization of transportation structure, the promoting effect decreased gradually and showed the inversed \u201cU\u201d trend. (3) The impact of transportation energy efficiency on transportation carbon emissions showed a function of inhibition before pulling. In order to predict the potential of carbon emission reduction, three scenarios were set.
