This has major implications for attempts to derive the theoretical intensities of emission lines used for spectroscopic diagnostic analyses of the plasma properties. During the impulsive phase we find that the emissivities of He I, He II and C IV in the transition region can be strongly enhanced above their expected equilibrium values, followed by a significant reduction which increases the amount of chromo- spheric plasma ablated into the corona. Furthermore, during the flare heating the overall charge state of the coronal ions can be significantly lower than is suggested by an equilibrium ionisation balance and, therefore, line ratio measurements will yield plasma temperatures that are much greater than the formation temperature of the emitting ion. During the gradual phase the emissivity at transition region temperatures remains suppressed, compared with its equilibrium value, with correspondingly reduced downflow velocities and increased radiative cooling time-scales. Finally, we synthesise the emission as it would be detected by TRACE in its 171 A and 195 A wavelength bands, and find that the filter ratio technique can give reasonably good estimates of the plasma temperature in quiescence, though when the populations of Fe VIII, Fe IX, Fe X and Fe XII exhibit departures from equilibrium the temperatures derived from filter ratio measurements become unreliable.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "454457896567a2a5259433fcae7db29d1b256558", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044030095", "DOI": "10.1115/ES2008-54326", "CorpusId": 203414600}, "title": "Cost Optimization of a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle", "abstract": "In order to decrease the use of petroleum and release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, the efficiency of transportation vehicles must be increased. One way to increase vehicle efficiency is by extending the electric-only operation of hybrid electric vehicles through the addition of batteries that can be charged using grid electricity. These plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are currently being developed for introduction into the U.S. market. As with any consumer good, cost is an important design metric. This study optimizes a PHEV design for a mid-size, gasoline-powered passenger vehicle in terms of cost. Three types of batteries, Pb-acid, NiMH, and Li-ion, and three all-electric ranges of 10, 20, and 40 miles (16.1, 32.2, and 64.4 km) were examined. System modeling was performed using Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT), an Argonne National Laboratory-developed tool. Performance constraints such as acceleration, sustained grade ability, and top speed were met by all systems. The societal impact of the least cost optimum system was quantified in terms of reduced carbon emissions and gasoline consumption. All of the cost optimal designs (one for each combination of all-electric distance and battery type) demonstrated more than a 60% reduction in gasoline consumption and 45% reduction in CO2 emissions, including the emissions generated from producing the electricity used to charge the battery pack, as compared with an average car in the current U.S. fleet. The least cost design for each all-electric range consisted of a Pb-acid design, including a necessary battery replacement of the battery pack twice during the 15 year assumed life. Due to the cost of the battery packs, the 10-mile all-electric range proved to be the least costly. Also, this system saved the most carbon dioxide emissions, a 53% reduction. The most fuel savings came from the PHEV40 system, yielding an 80% reduction in gasoline consumption.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "4d5591bc6804b0d02583c9b9eeefd069ecbcd50d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2485342123", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511996191.003", "CorpusId": 13185428}, "title": "Introduction and overview of the chapters", "abstract": "Opening remarks This book aiMS to explore aspects of the future demand for electricity in the light of the challenges posed by climate change. In the UK we have a formal target for the reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 80 per cent by 2050 (on 1990 levels). Official publications regularly suggest that reducing overall energy demand is an important part of meeting that target. Indeed, in a recent report of the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC, 2009, p. 22), it was suggested that residential energy efficiency measures could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tonnes per annum (or around 10 per cent of the UK's current total emissions) by 2022. The UK is not alone: many other countries have targets and aspirations for the reduction of energy consumption. Meanwhile, the future of energy demand will increasingly be synonymous with the future of electricity demand if the heat and transport sectors are electrified over the coming decades. Decarbonization of the energy sector is not just about reducing energy demand. Emissions from direct combustion of heat and direct combustion of liquid fuel in vehicles are roughly equal to emissions from power stations. Reducing emissions from electricity production is technically feasible via a combination of renewables, nuclear power and carbon-capture-and-storage equipment. This implies that switching heating and transportation demand for energy from combustion of fossil fuels to heat from electricity (or combined heat and power) and to electric vehicles is important in reducing emissions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ccf9d66d5de06ac08ce0c4c5e7a6e27c3ec3ec6a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2328973237", "DOI": "10.1021/EF200413U", "CorpusId": 101076053}, "title": "Emissions of NOx and SO2 from Coals of Various Ranks, Bagasse, and Coal-Bagasse Blends Burning in O2/N2 and O2/CO2 Environments.", "abstract": "Oxy-coal combustion is a viable technology, for new and existing coal-fired power plants, as it facilitates carbon capture and, thereby, can mitigate climate change.

By far, the largest figures are associated with infrastructure and transportation while GHG emissions and health constitute smaller portions of total costs, although the latter do have serious implications in terms of the attainability of national emissions reductions targets (redevelopment will save 4,400 tonne of GHG per year for 1,000 dwellings) and the Australian population\u2019s health and well being (now one of the most obese populations in the world). Emissions and health savings are closely related to active forms of travel that are only realizable in areas with high levels of amenity and servicing and high levels of transit access. Their cost savings over a 50 year urban lifetime are quite modest, $19.32 million and $4.23 million for 1000 dwellings, but if these more walkable, low emission developments are pursued then the savings in transport and infrastructure for 1000 dwellings are in the order of $86 million up-front for infrastructure and $250 million for annualized transportation costs over 50 years.

The aim of this paper is to examine the effect of this implementation on emission reductions and costs, using data from Norwegian manufacturing industries. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to construct a frontier of all efficient installations. The frontier is based on all installations within an industry that use the Best Practice Technique (BPT). We estimate the changes in emissions due to the implementation of IPPC as the difference between an installation\u2019s actual emissions and the emissions that would occur if it operated on the frontier. The method reveals a strong potential for emission reductions. Further, estimates of short-run abatement costs indicate that considerable emission reductions can be achieved with low or no costs, but that the implementation of a strict BAT principle for all installations involves substantial costs. To the extent that the abatement costs of an installation would be excessive, IPPC includes some limited modifications of the strict BAT principle.

The existing literature that tests the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis within the framework of the black-box approaches provides only a bird\u2019s-eye perspective on the long-run income-environment relationship. The aspiration behind this study is making the first step toward the disentanglement of the sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which could be employed in the pollution mitigation policies of this group of countries. Based on the combination of two strands of literature, the environmental Kuznets curve conjecture and the resource curse, the paper at hand proposes an augmented theoretical framework of this inquiry. To approach the research questions empirically, the study employs advanced panel cointegration techniques. To avoid econometric misspecification, the study also employs for the first time a nonparametric time-varying coefficient panel data estimator with fixed effects (NPFE) for the dataset of 37 oil-producing countries in the time interval spanning between 1989 and 2019. The empirical analysis identifies the level of per capita income, the magnitude of oil rents, the share of fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the energy mix, and the share of the manufacturing sector in GDP as essential drivers of carbon dioxide emissions in the oil-rich countries. Tertiarization, on the contrary, leads to a substantial reduction of emissions. Another striking result of this study is that level of political rights and civil liberties are negatively associated with per capita carbon emissions in this group of countries. Furthermore, the study decisively rejects an inverted U-shaped income-emission relationship and validates the monotonically or exponentially increasing impact of average income on carbon dioxide emissions.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "84e5e15637bff4690ed5b385ad0ad3ea9c92de29", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2795609506", "DOI": "10.1007/s10311-018-0735-6", "CorpusId": 103185092}, "title": "Residential emissions predicted as a major source of fine particulate matter in winter over the Yangtze River Delta, China", "abstract": "Air pollution is an increasingly critical health issue responsible for numerous diseases and deaths worldwide. In China, to address severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region, the local government has formulated Five-Year Plans to set the road map for air pollution control by phased targets in 2020, but the effectiveness of these policies is still uncertain. There is therefore a need for accurate prediction of control strategies. Here we present a computational evaluation of the predicted effectiveness of four emission control strategies: normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry and power plants, and normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry, power plants and transportation, designed on the basis of policies of the 13th Five-Year Plans. Effectiveness was tested on concentrations of PM2.5, e.g., particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, using the two-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting\u2014Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model. Results show that by implementing the four emission control strategies, only Hangzhou with the strictest emission controls in four main cities (Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai) can meet the 20% reduction goals of PM2.5 concentrations in the 13th Five-Year Plan, indicating that current policies are not sufficient to control the severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region. Sensitivity tests show that residential emissions have the highest contributions to the PM2.5 concentrations in January in the four main cities of Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai, followed by agriculture, industry, transportation and power plants. Predicted annual mean reduction percentages for PM2.5 are the highest in Hangzhou, from \u2212\u00a09.7 to \u2212\u00a020.1%, followed by Nanjing, from \u2212\u00a08.2 to \u2212\u00a018.7%, Shanghai, from \u2212\u00a07.4 to \u2212\u00a015.8%, and Hefei, from \u2212\u00a06.1 to \u2212\u00a013.8%. This finding highlights the predominance of residential emissions, which should be better controlled, notably coal burning. By comparison, predicted annual contributions of regional transport and natural sources to mean PM2.5 concentrations in four cities range from 29.2 to 36.6%. Overall, a major finding is that residential sources are of comparable importance to industrial, power plant and transportation sources to PM2.5 concentrations, especially for winter.

Our results suggest that vehicles that EVs replace are relatively fuel-efficient: EVs replace gasoline vehicles with an average fuel economy of 4.2 mpg above the fleet-wide average and 12 percent of them replace hybrid vehicles. This implies that ignoring the non-random replacement of gasoline vehicles would result in overestimating emissions benefits of EVs by 39 percent. Federal income tax credits resulted in a 29 percent increase in EV sales, but 70 percent of the credits were obtained by households that would have bought an EV without the credits. By simulating alternative subsidy designs, we find that a subsidy designed to provide greater incentives to low-income households would have been more cost effective and less regressive.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "ba70c3e15ca26c311c94a4c1febd8776d265418a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2315564457", "DOI": "10.1021/es200223x", "CorpusId": 206944797, "PubMed": "21662986"}, "title": "Significance of RuO2 modified SCR catalyst for elemental mercury oxidation in coal-fired flue gas.", "abstract": "Catalytic conversion of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) to its oxidized form has been considered as an effective way to enhance mercury removal from coal-fired power plants.

This assessment was represented in the IMAGE and GLOBIOM/G4M models by replicating the impact of successful national policies at the sector level in all world regions. The first step was to select successful policies in nine policy areas. In the second step, the impact on the energy and land-use systems or GHG emissions was identified and translated into model parameters, assuming that it would be possible to translate the impacts of the policies to other countries. As a result, projected annual GHG emission levels would be about 50 GtCO2e by 2030 (2% above 2010 levels), compared to the 60 GtCO2e in the \u2018current policies\u2019 scenario. Most reductions are achieved in the electricity sector through expanding renewable energy, followed by the reduction of fluorinated gases, reducing venting and flaring in oil and gas production, and improving industry efficiency. Materializing the calculated mitigation potential might not be as straightforward given different country priorities, policy preferences and circumstances. Key policy insights Considerable emissions reductions globally would be possible, if a selection of successful policies were replicated and implemented in all countries worldwide.

In addition, a detailed analysis of bright X-ray nuclei that could be affected by pile-up has been performed. X-ray emission was detected for all the nuclei of the radio sources in our sample except for 3C 319. Among the current sample, there are two compact steep spectrum radio sources, two broad-line radio galaxies, and one wide angle tail radio galaxy, 3C 89, hosted in a cluster of galaxies clearly visible in our Chandra snapshot observation. In addition, we also detected soft X-ray emission arising from the galaxy cluster surrounding 3C 196.1.

Weather conditions, soil inorganic N dynamics, and N2O emissions were monitored during spring, and soil samples were analyzed for abundances of nitrite reduction (nirK and nirS) and N2O reduction genes (nosZ clade I and II), and structure of nitrite- and N2O-reducing communities. Fertilization significantly enhanced soil mineral N accumulation compared to treatments with catch crop residues as the only N source. Nitrous oxide emissions, in contrast, were stimulated in rotations with catch crop residue incorporation, probably as a result of concurrent net N mineralization, and O2 depletion associated with residue degradation in organic hotspots. Emissions of N2O from digested manure were low in both years, while emissions from mineral N fertilizer were nearly absent in the first year, but comparable to emissions from catch crop residues in the second year with higher precipitation and delayed plant N uptake. Higher gene abundances, as well as shifts in community structure, were also observed in the second year, which were significantly correlated to NO3- availability. Both the size and structure of the nitrite- and N2O-reducing communities correlated to the difference in N2O emissions between years, while there were no consistent effects of management as represented by catch crops or fertilization.

CAVs could provide better access to mobility that is not only significantly safer, but also potentially cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient. These technologies could play a leading role in addressing the enormous challenge of climate change, yet their ultimate environmental impact is an open question whose answer will be influenced by a large array of decisions yet to come. We have an opportunity now, while policy is in its infancy, to shape the direction of CAVs to ensure that the transformational change they will bring is overwhelmingly positive for the environment. The challenge of automated vehicles is that they could make the perceived cost of driving much lower than it is today, resulting in large increases in vehicle miles traveled, energy used, and greenhouse gas emissions. In the worst case, poetically termed the \u201cdystopian nightmare\u201d by MacKenzie, vehicle miles traveled would skyrocket, while the lack of a comprehensive regulatory approach would prevent many of the potential benefits of CAVs from materializing. There is, however, a much more positive road CAVs can take. Connected and automated technology can facilitate more efficient vehicles, electric powertrains, shared mobility, smoother traffic flow, and even a reshaping of how we design, live, and move in our urban areas. Research suggests that energy and GHG emissions could be reduced by as much as 90%, without sacrificing personal mobility. Achieving this vision will require researchers, engineers, and policy makers to maintain a clear and constant focus on energy and environmental considerations during every stage of development. Here, we consider five important aspects of the developing CAV market with environmental and energy implications. First, fuel economy. While federal regulations will double new vehicle fuel economy by 2025, CAVs have the potential to go much further. With CAVs, vehicle acceleration, speed, braking, following distance, and routing decisions can all be optimized to provide more efficient travel. If CAVs can reliably lead to near zero collisions, as many experts anticipate, vehicles could become substantially lighter, as fewer safety features are needed. Finally, as more vehicles become connected and automated, vehicle platooning could lead to improved aerodynamics. All of these advances could lead to substantial improvements in fuel economy. At the same time, they raise many important questions, such as which factors should drive the vehicle optimization and decision-making protocols that will affect the energy these vehicles consume, and how to test and measure these vehicles. Second, connectivity between vehicles (V2V) and infrastructure (V2I). With adequate V2 V and V2I connectivity, vehicles (and infrastructure) will have far more information available with which to make better decisions. Individual vehicles can smooth their driving patterns and avoid collisions, whereas infrastructure can better respond to vehicles to further reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and reduce idling at stoplights. Ultimately, V2I connectivity can facilitate system wide efficiencies above and beyond what is achievable with only vehicle-based systems. The magnitude of these efficiencies, as well as the degree of induced demand and changes in travel patterns, are important and as yet unanswered questions. Third, revolutionary new transportation ideas and tools. The power of the smartphone is already changing how we use transportation, and has huge potential, especially in conjunction with CAVs. New apps can help integrate personal and public transportation by solving the first and last mile problem, increase vehicle occupancy through ride-sharing, enable development of flexible transit systems that are responsive to demand, provide right-sized vehicles for specific trips, and enable a shift from private vehicle ownership to transportation as a service. All of these opportunities can make personal mobility more available and affordable, and reduce energy use and emissions. The factors that influence how people harness these tools and their effect on transportation choices is an important area for further research.

Even though PV is a low-carbon technology, the difference between hybrid and process-sum results for 10% penetration of PV in the U.S. electrical grid is 0.13% of total current grid emissions. Extending LCA from the process-sum to hybrid analysis makes a significant difference.

NH3 emissions were up to 49 mg/km for gasoline passenger cars, up to 69 mg/km for the CNG light-commercial vehicle and up to 17 mg/km a diesel passenger car equipped with a selective catalytic reduction system (SCR). On the other hand, N2O and CH4 emissions accounted for up to 9.8 g CO2 eqv/km for a diesel passenger car equipped with a combination of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), lean NOx traps (LNT), SCR and possibly an ammonia slip catalyst ASC.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "12cfe3f1914b977bf0da08011fb49e4150c13c7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2294643811", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-014-1289-7", "CorpusId": 130245216}, "title": "Greenhouse gas intensity of three main crops and implications for low-carbon agriculture in China", "abstract": "China faces significant challenges in reconciling food security goals with the objective of becoming a low-carbon economy.

Relative to wheat and maize, GHGI of rice production is much higher owing to CH4 emissions, and is more closely related to yield levels. In general, the south and central has been the most carbon intensive region in rice production while the GHGI of wheat production is highest in north and northwest provinces. The southwest has been characterized by the highest maize GHGI but the lowest rice GHGI.

The simultaneous observation and analysis of atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) on a regional scale is an important approach to develop control strategies for haze pollution. In this study, samples of filtered PM2.5 were collected simultaneously at three urban sites (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang) and at a regional background site (Xinglong) in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region from June 2014 to April 2015. The PM2.5 at the four sites was mainly comprised of organic matter, secondary inorganic ions, and mineral dust. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) demonstrated that, on an annual basis, secondary inorganic aerosol was the largest PM2.5 source in this region, accounting for 29.2\u201340.5\u202f% of the PM2.5 mass at the urban sites; the second-largest PM2.5 source was motor vehicle exhaust, particularly in Beijing (24.9\u202f%), whereas coal combustion was also a large source in Tianjin (12.4\u202f%) and Shijiazhuang (15.5\u202f%), with particular dominance in winter. Secondary inorganic aerosol plays a vital role in the haze process, with the exception of the spring haze in Shijiazhuang and Tianjin, for which the dust source was crucial. In addition to secondary transformations, local direct emissions (coal combustion and motor vehicle exhaust) significantly contribute to the winter haze at the urban sites. Moreover, with the aggravation of haze pollution, the OC\u202f\u2215\u202fEC mass ratio of PM2.5 decreased considerably and the nitrate-rich secondary aerosol increased during all four seasons in Beijing, both of which indicate that local motor vehicle emissions significantly contribute to the severe haze episodes in Beijing. To assess the impacts of regional transport on haze pollution, the PMF results were further processed with backward-trajectory cluster analysis, revealing that haze pollution usually occurred when air masses originating from polluted industrial regions in the south prevailed and is characterized by high PM2.5 loadings with considerable contributions from secondary aerosols. This study suggests that control strategies to mitigate haze pollution in the BTH region should focus on the reduction of gaseous precursor emissions from fossil fuel combustion (motor vehicle emissions in Beijing and coal combustion in Tianjin, Hebei, and nearby provinces).", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f71fd77fd14e99da4d70ba0fb3c2da7414d52df3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2045990912", "DOI": "10.1080/10473289.2011.608622", "CorpusId": 22143318, "PubMed": "28098030"}, "title": "Particulate Emissions from a Stationary Engine Fueled with Ultra-Low-Sulfur Diesel and Waste-Cooking-Oil-Derived Biodiesel", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Stationary diesel engines, especially diesel generators, are increasingly being used in both developing countries and developed countries because of increased power demand. Emissions from such engines can have adverse effects on the environment and public health. In this study, particulate emissions from a domestic stationary diesel generator running on ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) and biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil were characterized for different load conditions. Results indicated a reduction in particulate matter (PM) mass and number emissions while switching diesel to biodiesel. With increase in engine load, it was observed that particle mass increased, although total particle counts decreased for all the fuels. The reduction in total number concentration at higher loads was, however, dependent on percentage of biodiesel in the diesel-biodiesel blend. For pure biodiesel (B100), the reduction in PM emissions for full load compared to idle mode was around 9%, whereas for ULSD the reduction was 26%. A large fraction of ultrafine particles (UFPs) was found in the emissions from biodiesel compared to ULSD. Nearly 90% of total particle concentration in biodiesel emissions comprised ultrafine particles. Particle peak diameter shifted from a smaller to a lower diameter with increase in biodiesel percentage in the fuel mixture. IMPLICATIONS There has been an increased usage of stationary diesel engines, especially backup power generators to meet the growing energy demand. Biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil has received increasing attention as an alternative fuel. However, data are only sparsely available in the literature on particulate emissions from stationary engines, fueled with blends of diesel and biodiesel.

The use of direct-fed microbials (DFM) is one possible option to decrease CH4 emission from ruminants. Direct-fed microbials are already used in ruminants mainly to increase productivity and to improve health, and are readily accepted by producers and consumers alike. However, studies on the use of DFM as rumen CH4 mitigants are scarce. A few studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown a CH4-decreasing effect but, to date, there has not been a systematic exploration of DFM as modulators of rumen methanogenesis. In this review, we explored biochemical pathways competing with methanogenesis that, potentially, could be modulated by the use of DFM. Pathways involving the redirection of H2 away from methanogenesis and pathways producing less H2 during feed fermentation are the preferred options. Propionate formation is an example of the latter option that in addition to decrease CH4 formation increases the retention of energy from the diet. Homoacetogenesis is a pathway using H2 to produce acetate, however up to now no acetogen has been shown to efficiently compete with methanogens in the rumen. Nitrate and sulphate reduction are pathways competing with methanogenesis, but the availability of these substances in the rumen is limited. Although there were studies using nitrate and sulphate as chemical additives, use of DFM for improving these processes and decrease the accumulation of toxic metabolites needs to be explored more. There are some other pathways such as methanotrophy and capnophily or modes of action such as inhibition of methanogens that theoretically could be provided by DFM and affect methanogenesis.

The objective of this study is to examine the climate change mitigation potential of the forest sector by developing and assessing potential mitigation strategies and portfolios with various goals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. From a systems perspective, mitigation potentials of five individual strategies and their combinations were examined with regionally differentiated implementations of changes. We also calculated cost curves for the strategies and explored socio-economic impacts using an input-output model. Our results showed a wide range of mitigation potentials and that both the magnitude and the timing of mitigation varied across strategies. The greatest mitigation potential was achieved by improving the harvest utilization, shifting the commodity mix to longer-lived wood products, and using harvest residues for bioenergy. The highest cumulative mitigation of 421\u00a0MtCO2e for BC was estimated when employing the strategy portfolio that maximized domestic mitigation during 2017\u20132050, and this would contribute 35% of BC\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2050 at less than $100/tCO2e and provide additional socio-economic benefits.

With hydrogen supplement to the main fuel, SI engines can run very lean resulting in a large reduction in nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emissions relative to stoichiometric combustion without a catalytic converter.

The tests were performed with and without hydrogen-rich gas produced by the plasma boosted fuel converter with gasoline. A one hundred fold reduction in NO x due to very lean operation was obtained under certain conditions. An advantage of onboard plasma-boosted generation of hydrogen-rich gas is that it is used only when required and can be readily turned on and off.

Our simulation results show a decrease of ozone of 8% over Europe in May 2020 due to the emission reductions. The simulated reductions are in line with observed changes in ground-level ozone. The source apportionment results show that this decrease is mainly due to the decreased ozone precursors from anthropogenic origin. Further, our results show that the ozone reduction is much smaller than the reduction of the total NO x emissions (around 20%), mainly caused by an increased ozone production efficiency. This means that more ozone is produced for each emitted NO x molecule. Hence, more ozone is formed from natural emissions and the ozone productivities of the remaining anthropogenic emissions increase.

Over the 21st century, changes in CO2 levels, climate and land use are expected to alter the global distribution of vegetation, leading to changes in trace gas emissions from plants, including, importantly, the emissions of isoprene. This, combined with changes in anthropogenic emissions, has the potential to impact tropospheric ozone levels, which above a certain level are harmful to animals and vegetation. In this study we use a biogenic emissions model following the empirical parameterisation of the MEGAN model, with vegetation distributions calculated by the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM) to explore a range of potential future (2095) changes in isoprene emissions caused by changes in climate (including natural land use changes), land use, and the inhibition of isoprene emissions by CO2. From the present-day (2000) value of 467 Tg C yr\u22121, we find that the combined impact of these factors could cause a net decrease in isoprene emissions of 259 Tg C yr\u22121 (55%) with individual contributions of +78 Tg C yr\u22121 (climate change), \u2212190 Tg C yr\u22121 (land use) and \u2212147 Tg C yr\u22121 (CO2 inhibition). Using these isoprene emissions and changes in anthropogenic emissions, a series of integrations is conducted with the UM-UKCA chemistry-climate model with the aim of examining changes in ozone over the 21st century. Globally, all combined future changes cause a decrease in the tropospheric ozone burden of 27 Tg (7%) from 379 Tg in the present-day. At the surface, decreases in ozone of 6\u201310 ppb are calculated over the oceans and developed northern hemispheric regions, due to reduced NOx transport by PAN and reductions in NOx emissions in these areas respectively. Increases of 4\u20136 ppb are calculated in the continental tropics due to cropland expansion in these regions, increased CO2 inhibition of isoprene emissions, and higher temperatures due to climate change. These effects outweigh the decreases in tropical ozone caused by increased tropical isoprene emissions with climate change. Our land use change scenario consists of cropland expansion, which is most pronounced in the tropics. The tropics are also where land use change causes the greatest increases in ozone. As such there is potential for increased crop exposure to harmful levels of ozone. However, we find that these ozone increases are still not large enough to raise ozone to such damaging levels.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "0d56d1d738a9e0f674ffa031005c24f9c53d1733", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1994047524", "DOI": "10.1128/AEM.00924-09", "CorpusId": 206721474, "PubMed": "20023079"}, "title": "Archaeal Diversity and Distribution along Thermal and Geochemical Gradients in Hydrothermal Sediments at the Yonaguni Knoll IV Hydrothermal Field in the Southern Okinawa Trough", "abstract": "ABSTRACT A variety of archaeal lineages have been identified using culture-independent molecular phylogenetic surveys of microbial habitats occurring in deep-sea hydrothermal environments such as chimney structures, sediments, vent emissions, and chemosynthetic macrofauna.

The variation between beef cattle in methane emissions is partly genetic, whether measured as methane production, methane yield (methane production/DMI), or residual methane production (observed methane production - expected methane production), with heritabilities ranging from 0.19 to 0.29. This suggests methane emissions could be reduced by selection. Given the high cost of measuring methane production from individual beef cattle, genomic selection is the most feasible approach to achieve this reduction in emissions. We derived genomic EBV (GEBV) for methane traits from a reference set of 747 Angus animals phenotyped for methane traits and genotyped for 630,000 SNP. The accuracy of GEBV was tested in a validation set of 273 Angus animals phenotyped for the same traits. Accuracies of GEBV ranged from 0.29 \u00b1 0.06 for methane yield and 0.35 \u00b1 0.06 for residual methane production.

The highly stable borylated unit possesses a significantly lower LUMO energy than the pristine polymer resulting in a reduction in the band gap of the polymer by up to 0.63 eV and a red shift in emission of more than 150 nm. Extensively borylated polymers absorb strongly in the deep red/near-IR and are highly emissive in the near-IR region of the spectrum in solution and solid state. Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values are extremely high in the solid state for materials with emission maxima \u2265 700 nm with PLQY values of 44% at 700 nm and 11% at 757 nm for PF8-BT with different borylation levels. This high brightness enables efficient solution processed near-IR emitting OLEDs to be fabricated and highly emissive borylated polymer loaded conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNPs) to be prepared. The latter are bright, photostable, low toxicity bioimaging agents that in phantom mouse studies show higher signal to background ratios for emission at 820 nm than the ubiquitous near-IR emissive bioimaging agent indocyanine green.

Road transport is a significant contributor to UK CO2 emissions, with the majority arising from personal road transport. This paper analyses Personal Carbon Trading (PCT) as a potentially powerful climate change policy tool and presents findings from an exploratory survey of public opinion. A working model of a PCT scheme with a fixed carbon cap was designed to achieve a 60% reduction of CO2 emissions from personal road transport by 2050. A proportion of the annual carbon budget would be given to individuals as a free carbon permit allocation. There is an opportunity to sell unused permits. Fuel price increases (FPI) were recognised as having the potential to achieve an identical emissions target at a much lower cost. A series of individual interviews were conducted to explore opinions related to the impacts, effectiveness, fairness and acceptability of both measures. Bespoke software was used to record behavioural response. The findings indicate that certain design aspects of the PCT scheme led to it being preferred to the FPI and suggest that the potential behavioural response to PCT may be greater than for a FPI. However, given that the sample was small and biased towards the highly educated and those with above average incomes, the findings should be considered as preliminary indications.

Diesel-water emulsion, as alternative fuel, has potential to significantly reduce the formation of NOx and PM in the diesel engine. The emulsion fuel contains water (in the range of 5\u201315%) and diesel fuel with specific surfactants, to stabilize the system. Reduction of NOx is originated from the reduction of local high temperature due to vaporized water during combustion. The reduction of local high temperature may cause the reduction of reaction rate, which has a possibility of affording a mixing time for better combustion for reducing PM. Micro-explosion, considered as the second atomization, improves fuel combustion and reduces fuel consumption. The heterogeneous results regarding the use of diesel-water emulsion as fuel for diesel engines suggest that experimental work for optimizing the emulsion formulation in terms of water content and internal structure is recommended.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a45bbb3bf303206b54ea81c831297437218fccad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2238162726", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.922491", "CorpusId": 56389293}, "title": "Why Do Firms Pollute (and Reduce) Toxic Emissions?", "abstract": "There is a growing trend in both the U.S. and abroad for firms to reduce emission levels beyond the legally required mandate. One of the most publicized examples of this phenomenon in the U.S. is the release of toxic chemicals. These emissions have come under increasing scrutiny since passage of the \"Right-to-Know\" law mandating the public availability of toxic release inventory (TRI) information beginning in 1989. In response to this new information, some firms have dramatically reduced toxic chemical emissions. This paper explores the factors that both explain differences across firms in their initial toxic emission levels and in the reductions beyond any legally required levels subsequent to the availability of public information on TRI. The underlying theory is that firm-level pollution varies because of firm-specific factors that affect both the \"ability\" and \"incentive\" for firms to reduce pollution. In comparing emission levels between 1989 and 1992, we find that the largest firms are most likely to reduce emissions subsequent to this new information being made public. We also find that financial ability plays an important role in emission levels. On the other hand, we were unable to find any evidence that firms who advertise more heavily to consumers or had significant negative media attention concerning their emission levels reduced their emissions more than average after controlling for firm size.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "4e7c0d9047c2f5f5f359920e2cdccf891ba555bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2160972744", "DOI": "10.1109/FISTS.2011.5973604", "CorpusId": 15225304}, "title": "Reduction of area-wide emissions using an efficient model-based traffic control strategy", "abstract": "In addition to the challenge to reduce traffic jams, reduction of traffic emissions in such a way that the dispersion of the emissions to residential areas, hospitals, schools, and other neighborhoods is decreased is a problem that requires state-of-the-art traffic control and management solutions.

The model is developed in such a way that the computation time is less than a previously proposed point-source model, while still capturing the important dispersion dynamics so that it can be used for on-line control applications. In order to reduce the dispersion of emissions to a neighborhood we design a parameterized model predictive control (MPC) strategy to optimize variable speed limits and ramp metering rates.
