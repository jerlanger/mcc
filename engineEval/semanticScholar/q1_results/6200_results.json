[14C]DCMU-binding experiments now show that the number and affinity of DCMU-binding sites (normalized to chlorophyll) are equivalent in delta psbO and the wild type, suggesting equal concentrations of assembled reaction centers. A similar conclusion is reached on the basis of measurements of PSII electron transport (DPC-supported DCPIP reduction) by mutant and wild-type thylakoids. The pattern of flash O2 yield by delta psbO cells measured with a bare platinum electrode exhibits a period four oscillation (with a maximum on the third flash), indicating that the H2O-splitting enzyme in delta psbO retains the basic mechanistic features found in normal cells. However, the amplitude of these signals is smaller and more highly damped than those obtained from wild-type cells, suggesting the absence of MSP results in a higher miss probability and/or a reduction in the number of centers competent in oxygen evolution. Analysis of the rise kinetics of the ampermeric signal on the bare platinum electrode indicates that the S3-[S4]-S0 transition is retarded by at least a factor of 5 in the mutant. Thermoluminescence emission peak temperatures indicate that the S2QA-, S2QB-, and S3QB-charge pairs are significantly more stable with respect to recombination in the mutant.

Surface CH4 flux decreased from 64 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121 in intact polygons to 7 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121 in degraded polygons, and stable isotope signatures of CH4 and DIC showed that acetate cleavage dominated CH4 production in low\u2010centered polygons, while CO2 reduction was the primary pathway in degraded polygons.

McDonnell Foundation (JSMF), I wish to clarify our position on the recovery of indirect research costs, which include overheads such as administration and building-maintenance costs (Nature 476, 385; 2011). You are correct in that the JSMF does not allow applicant institutions to include indirect costs as a component of budget requests; however, this should not be branded as a 'refusal' to fund indirect costs. The JSMF, like many private foundations, considers it inappropriate for institutions to request indirect costs from private funders. In the United States, recovery of indirect costs by universities is negotiated with federal funding agencies because most US-funded research is done on university campuses. It is unfortunate that a misunderstanding over the history and reasons for recovering indirect costs continues to strain relations between universities and private funders. A core mission of universities and education is the creation of new knowledge through research and scholarship. Grants from private funders such as the JSMF are helping universities to realize these goals; contrary to common belief, foundation grants are budget-relieving, not budget-additive. Providing for indirect costs would be incompatible with this traditional relationship. performance, environmental quality and social development. The State Council, for example, has proposed national emission-reduction targets in its latest five-year plan (2011\u201315), for which the eco-indicator is a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 40\u201345% in 2020 relative to 2005 levels (see go.nature.com/4k3mqo). Others include circular-economy indicators released by the National Development and Reform Commission in 2007 to address the environmental degradation and resource scarcity associated with rapid economic development (H.

The authors consider a\"pure\"carbon tax as well as various proxy taxes such as those on energy or energy-intensive sectors like transport and basic metals, all of which achieve the same level of carbon reduction. In general, the more targeted the tax to carbon emissions, the better the welfare results. If a carbon tax is feasible, it will have the least marginal cost of abatement by a substantial amount when compared to alternative tax instruments. If a carbon tax is not feasible, a sales tax on energy inputs is the next best option. Moreover, labor market distortions such as labor market segmentation or unemployment will likely dominate the welfare and equity implications of a carbon tax for South Africa. This being the case, if South Africa were able to remove some of the distortions in the labor market, the cost of carbon taxation would be negligible.

Various combinations of volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission reductions were effective in lowering modeled peak 1-hr O3 concentrations. VOC emissions reductions alone had only a modest impact on modeled peak 8-hr O3 concentrations. Anthropogenic NOx emissions reductions of 46\u201386% of 1996 base case values were needed to reach the level of the 8-hr standard in some areas. As NOx emissions are reduced, O3 production efficiency increases, which accounts for the less than proportional response of calculated 8-hr O3 levels. Such increases in O3 production efficiency also were noted in previous modeling work for central California. O3 production in some urban core areas, such as New York City and Chicago, IL, was found to be VOC-limited.

During the nineteenth century people relied predominantly on a wide range of natural materials, such as wood, hides, wool and starch, to provide the essentials of then-modern life. This picture changed significantly during the twentieth century, when people in developed countries experiencing the industrial revolution became almost totally dependent on fossil materials to produce the fuels, polymers and chemicals required for modern life.

The methods currently adopted to estimate the spatial variation of above- and below-ground biomass in tropical forests, in particular the Brazilian Amazon, are usually based on remote sensing analyses coupled with field datasets, which tend to be relatively scarce and often limited in their spatial distribution. There are notable differences among the resulting biomass maps found in the literature. These differences subsequently result in relatively high uncertainties in the carbon emissions calculated from land use change, and have a larger impact when biomass maps are coded into biomass classes referring to specific ranges of biomass values. In this paper we analyze the differences among recently-published biomass maps of the Amazon region, including the official information used by the Brazilian government for its communication to the United Nation Framework on Climate Change Convention of the United Nations. The estimated average pre-deforestation biomass in the four maps, for the areas of the Amazon region that had been deforested during the 1990\u20132009 period, varied from 205\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 during 1990\u20131999, to 216\u2009\u00b1\u200931\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 during 2000\u20132009.

To summarize, our key findings were: (i) the current maps of Amazonian biomass show substantial variation in both total biomass and its spatial distribution; (ii) carbon emissions estimates from deforestation are highly dependent on the spatial distribution of biomass as determined by any single biomass map, and on the deforestation process itself; (iii) future deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is likely to affect forests with higher biomass than those deforested in the past, resulting in smaller reductions in carbon dioxide emissions than expected purely from the recent reductions in deforestation rates; and (iv) the current official estimate of carbon emissions from Amazonian deforestation is probably overestimated, because the recent loss of higher-biomass forests has not been taken into account.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "1886d8d9c9595caee03688cbd86089284e185d2b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048212741", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.61.1.14", "CorpusId": 36585831, "PubMed": "21305884"}, "title": "Effectiveness of Emission Control Technologies for Auxiliary Engines on Ocean-Going Vessels", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Large auxiliary engines operated on ocean-going vessels in transit and at berth impact the air quality of populated areas near ports. This paper presents new information on the comparison of emission ranges from three similar engines and the effectiveness of three control technologies: switching to cleaner burning fuels, operating in the low oxides of nitrogen (NOx) mode, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). In-use measurements of gaseous (NOx, carbon monoxide [CO], carbon dioxide [CO2]) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5; total and speciated) emissions were made on three auxiliary engines on post-PanaMax class container vessels following the International Organization for Standardization-8178-1 protocol. The in-use NOx emissions for the MAN B&W 7L32/40 engine family vary from 15 to 21.1 g/kW-hr for heavy fuel oil and 8.9 to 19.6 g/kW-hr for marine distillate oil. Use of cleaner burning fuels resulted in NOx reductions ranging from 7 to 41% across different engines and a PM2.5 reduction of up to 83%. The NOx reductions are a consequence of fuel nitrogen content and engine operation; the PM2.5 reduction is attributed to the large reductions in the hydrated sulfate and organic carbon (OC) fractions. As expected, operating in the low-NOx mode reduced NOx emissions by approximately 32% and nearly doubled elemental carbon (EC) emissions. However, PM2.5 emission factors were nearly unchanged because the EC emission factor is only approximately 5% of the total PM2.5 mass. SCR reduced the NOx emission factor to less than 2.4 g/kW-hr, but it increased the PM2.5 emissions by a factor of 1.5\u20133.8. This increase was a direct consequence of the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate emissions on the SCR catalyst. The EC and OC fractions of PM2.5 reduced across the SCR unit. IMPLICATIONS Agencies such as the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the California Air Resources Board are enacting new regulations on emissions from marine engines. This study provides in-use gaseous and PM2.5 emissions data on three control technologies that are being considered to attain these regulations. The results show that (1) switching to cleaner burning fuels significantly reduces PM2.5 with minor NOx reductions; (2) operating the engines in the low-NOx mode significantly reduces NOx without a statistically significant increase in PM2.5 emissions; and (3) although SCR is effective in NOx mitigation, it will increase the PM2.5 emissions with sulfur-containing fuels.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "49dc7c3cb09c554812f813b970b95a596f121427", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087225766", "DOI": "10.1109/JQE.2004.828263", "CorpusId": 5680213}, "title": "Spectroscopic and stimulated emission Characteristics of Nd/sup 3+/ in transparent YAG ceramics", "abstract": "Nd: YAG ceramic materials have been synthesized using vacuum sintering technique with the raw materials prepared by the nano-crystalline methods.

The climate warming effects of accelerated urbanization along with projected global climate change raise an urgent need for sustainable mitigation and adaptation strategies to cool urban climates. Our modeling results show that historical urbanization in the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas has increased daytime urban air temperature by 1.3 \u00b0C, in part due to a weakening of the onshore sea breeze circulation. We find that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can meaningfully offset this daytime warming, reducing temperatures by 0.9 \u00b0C relative to a case without cool roofs. Residential cool roofs were responsible for 67% of the cooling. Nocturnal temperature increases of 3.1 \u00b0C from urbanization were larger than daytime warming, while nocturnal temperature reductions from cool roofs of 0.5 \u00b0C were weaker than corresponding daytime reductions. We further show that cool roof deployment could partially counter the local impacts of global climate change in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Assuming a scenario in which there are dramatic decreases in greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century (RCP2.6), mid- and end-of-century temperature increases from global change relative to current climate are similarly reduced by cool roofs from 1.4 \u00b0C to 0.6 \u00b0C. Assuming a scenario with continued emissions increases throughout the century (RCP8.5), mid-century warming is significantly reduced by cool roofs from 2.0 \u00b0C to 1.0 \u00b0C. The end-century warming, however, is significantly offset only in small localized areas containing mostly industrial/commercial buildings where cool roofs with the highest albedo are adopted. We conclude that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can play an important role in mitigating the urban heat island effect, and offsetting near-term local warming from global climate change. Global-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way of avoiding long-term warming, however. We further suggest that both climate mitigation and adaptation can be pursued simultaneously using 'cool photovoltaics'.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f894ad98008d3655b252b6278b0a682a0742c9c2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2898126458", "DOI": "10.1007/s41061-018-0220-5", "CorpusId": 53101742, "PubMed": "30361990"}, "title": "Bimetallic Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction", "abstract": "The increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has caused various environmental issues.

However, there is some disagreement regarding the potential for natural gas to provide significant improvements relative to current ships and trucks. In 2015, road freight represented ~7% of global energy related CO2 emissions, with shipping representing ~2.6% of emissions. Emissions are also expected to grow, with estimates suggesting road freight emission growing by a third, and shipping emissions growing by 50% to 250% from 2012 to 2050, making absolute emissions reductions challenging. Reducing emissions in ships and trucks has proved technically difficult given the relatively long distances that ships and trucks travel. This paper documents a systematic review of literature detailing well-to-wheel/wake greenhouse gas emissions and economic costs in moving from diesel and heavy fuel oil to natural gas as a fuel for trucks and ships. The review found a number of important issues for greenhouse gas reduction. First, moderate greenhouse gas reductions of 10% were found when switching to natural gas from heavy fuel oil in shipping when comparing the lowest estimates. Comparing lowest well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions estimates for trucks, the benefit of switching to natural gas fuel is approximately a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, these emissions are highly variable, driven particularly by methane emissions in exhaust gas. Given this, in the worst cases natural gas ships and trucks emit more greenhouse gasses than the diesel trucks and heavy fuel oil ships that they would replace. It appears relatively cost effective to switch to natural gas as a transport fuel in ships and trucks. However, the limited emissions reduction potential raises questions for the ongoing role of natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the challenging greenhouse gas reduction targets emerging in the transport sector.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c473fc88cbb7f55dea92da80dd68fdabf6aadb1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120727216", "DOI": "10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<0117:UIEOMS>2.0.CO;2", "CorpusId": 59501228}, "title": "Uncertainties in Episodic Ozone Modeling Stemming from Uncertainties in the Meteorological Fields", "abstract": "This paper examines the uncertainty associated with photochemical modeling using the Variable-Grid Urban Airshed Model (UAM-V) with two different prognostic meteorological models.

The simulated ozone concentrations from the two photochemical modeling systems, namely, RAMS/ UAM-V and MM5/UAM-V, are compared with each other and with ozone observations from several monitoring sites in the eastern United States. The overall results indicate that neither modeling system performs significantly better than the other in reproducing the observed ozone concentrations. The results reveal that there is a significant variability, about 20% at the 95% level of confidence, in the modeled 1-h ozone concentration maxima from one modeling system to the other for a given episode. The model-to-model variability in the simulated ozone levels is for most part attributable to the unsystematic type of errors. The directionality for emission controls (i.e., NOx versus VOC sensitivity) is also evaluated with UAM-V using hypothetical emission reductions. The results reveal that not only the improvement in ozone but also the VOC-sensitive and NOx-sensitive regimes are influenced by the differences in the meteorological fields.

The effect of ammonia emission reductions on ecosystem service delivery was assessed using an impact pathway approach. A \u2018weakest link\u2019 analysis identified that economic valuation of impacts on many key ecosystem services was constrained by inadequate dose\u2013response relationships to predict physical changes in service flows and/or by an inability to produce economic valuations of the predicted physical changes. For effects on biodiversity, both the timescale of response and poorly defined relationships between changes in species composition and ecosystem service delivery are significant barriers.

The ecosystem service approach thus offers the potential to provide a holistic appraisal of the effects of emission reductions, and could therefore make a valuable contribution to future air quality management.

The scenarios with emission trading would drive more emission reductions, whereby the emission-cutting commitment for 2020 would be achieved and emission reductions in 2050 would be more than 57.90%. Meanwhile, the share of non-fossil energy increases significantly and would be more than doubled in 2050 compared with the BAU scenario. A carbon tax would result in a significant decline in emissions in the short term, but would have an adverse effect on economic growth and energy structure improvements. It is also observed that the integrated measures would not only substantially decrease the total emissions, but also improve the energy structure.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d24f8da5898808ae48e607337b40d59be57bff9b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3023905469", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2014.997658", "CorpusId": 219597722}, "title": "Linkage of greenhouse gas emissions trading systems: learning from experience", "abstract": "The last ten years have seen the growth of linkages between many of the world's cap-and-trade systems for GHGs, both directly between systems, and indirectly via connections to credit systems such as the Clean Development Mechanism. If nations have tried to act in their own self-interest, this proliferation of linkages implies that for many nations, the expected benefits of linkage outweighed expected costs. In this article, we draw on the past decade of experience with carbon markets to examine why systems have demonstrated this revealed preference for linking. Linkage is a multi-faceted policy decision that can be used by political jurisdictions to achieve a variety of objectives, and we find qualitative evidence that many economic, political, and strategic factors \u2013 ranging from geographic proximity to integrity of emissions reductions \u2013 influence the decision to link. We also identify some potentially important effects of linkage, such as loss of control over domestic carbon policies, which do not appear to have deterred real-world decisions to link. Policy relevance These findings have implications for the future role that decentralized linkages may play in international climate policy architecture. The Kyoto Protocol has entered what is probably its final commitment period, covering only a small fraction of global GHG emissions. Under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, negotiators may now gravitate toward a hybrid system, combining top-down elements for establishing targets with bottom-up elements of pledge-and-review tied to national policies and actions. The incentives for linking these national policies are likely to continue to produce direct connections among regional, national, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. The growing network of decentralized, direct linkages among these systems may turn out to be a key part of a future hybrid climate policy architecture.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "94ebf6c29e77ca7cca110cc2597a58b60add835b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2091643441", "DOI": "10.1007/BF03354007", "CorpusId": 154699773}, "title": "Long-term CO2 emission reduction scenarios in Japan", "abstract": "Japan\u2019s long-term CO2 emission reduction scenarios are assessed with a computable general equilibrium model with recursive dynamics, which was modified in order to assess the effects of renewable energy supply.

The following scenarios in which the level of CO2 emissions in 2050 will be 30% of the level in 1990 or less are proposed: (1) if the renewable energy supply in 2050 is less than the actual potential, an energy intensity improvement of 2.6% per year will bring about a CO2 emission level of 81 MtC in 2050; (2) if the electricity from renewable energy in 2050 can be supplied to the physical potential, and instead of solar heat, 50% more biomass energy can be supplied than the physical potential, the CO2 emission level in 2050 will be 86MtC by achieving a 2.0% per year energy intensity improvement.

A single side-firing optical fiber was used for both the delivery of 465 nm light-emitting diode excitation light and the collection of emitted fluorescence. It was placed interstitially within the prostate via a closed transparent plastic catheter. Fitting of the collected fluorescence emission spectra using the known fluorescence spectrum of 1 mg/kg MLu in an intralipid phantom yields a quantitative measure of the local MLu concentration. We found that an additional correction factor is needed to account for the reduction of the MLu fluorescence intensity measured in vivo due to strong optical absorption in the prostate. We have adopted an empirical correction formula given by C = (3.1 cm\u22121/\u03bc\u2032s) exp (\u03bceff\u00b70.97 cm), which ranges from approximately 3 to 16, with a mean of 9.3 \u00b1 4.8. Using a computer-controlled step motor to move the probe incrementally along parallel tracks within the prostate we can determine one-dimensional profiles of the MLu concentration. The absolute MLu concentration and the shape of its distribution are confirmed by ex vivo assay and by diffuse absorption measurements, respectively.

Aboveground tropical tree biomass and carbon storage estimates commonly ignore tree height (H). We estimate the effect of incorporating H on tropics-wide forest biomass estimates in 327 plots across four continents using 42 656 H and diameter measurements and harvested trees from 20 sites to answer the following questions: 1. What is the best H-model form and geographic unit to include in biomass models to minimise site-level uncertainty in estimates of destructive biomass? 2. To what extent does including H estimates derived in (1) reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates across all 327 plots? 3. What effect does accounting for H have on plot- and continental-scale forest biomass estimates? The mean relative error in biomass estimates of destructively harvested trees when including H (mean 0.06), was half that when excluding H (mean 0.13). Power- and Weibull-H models provided the greatest reduction in uncertainty, with regional Weibull-H models preferred because they reduce uncertainty in smaller-diameter classes (\u226440 cm D) that store about one-third of biomass per hectare in most forests. Propagating the relationships from destructively harvested tree biomass to each of the 327 plots from across the tropics shows that including H reduces errors from 41.8 Mg ha\u22121 (range 6.6 to 112.4) to 8.0 Mg ha\u22121 (\u22122.5 to 23.0). For all plots, aboveground live biomass was \u221252.2 Mg ha\u22121 (\u221282.0 to \u221220.3 bootstrapped 95% CI), or 13%, lower when including H estimates, with the greatest relative reductions in estimated biomass in forests of the Brazilian Shield, east Africa, and Australia, and relatively little change in the Guiana Shield, central Africa and southeast Asia. Appreciably different stand structure was observed among regions across the tropical continents, with some storing significantly more biomass in small diameter stems, which affects selection of the best height models to reduce uncertainty and biomass reductions due to H. After accounting for variation in H, total biomass per hectare is greatest in Australia, the Guiana Shield, Asia, central and east Africa, and lowest in east-central Amazonia, W. Africa, W. Amazonia, and the Brazilian Shield (descending order). Thus, if tropical forests span 1668 million km2 and store 285 Pg C (estimate including H), then applying our regional relationships implies that carbon storage is overestimated by 35 Pg C (31\u201339 bootstrapped 95% CI) if H is ignored, assuming that the sampled plots are an unbiased statistical representation of all tropical forest in terms of biomass and height factors. Our results show that tree H is an important allometric factor that needs to be included in future forest biomass estimates to reduce error in estimates of tropical carbon stocks and emissions due to deforestation.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "4138536d0fd6ef7f52df613fc33aca1eab782a5c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2054468941", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-015-4083-9", "CorpusId": 5181292, "PubMed": "25618308"}, "title": "Methane and CO2 emissions from China\u2019s hydroelectric reservoirs: a new quantitative synthesis", "abstract": "Controversy surrounds the green credentials of hydroelectricity because of the potentially large emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from associated reservoirs.

This study provides the first evaluation of the CO2 and CH4 emissions from China\u2019s hydroelectric reservoirs by considering the reservoir water surface and drawdown areas, and downstream sources (including spillways and turbines, as well as river downstream). The total emission of 29.6\u00a0Tg CO2/year and 0.47\u00a0Tg CH4/year from hydroelectric reservoirs in China, expressed as CO2 equivalents (eq), corresponds to 45.6\u00a0Tg CO2eq/year, which is 2-fold higher than the current GHG emission (ca. 23\u00a0Tg CO2eq/year) from global temperate hydropower reservoirs. China\u2019s average emission of 70\u00a0g CO2eq/kWh from hydropower amounts to 7\u00a0% of the emissions from coal-fired plant alternatives. China\u2019s hydroelectric reservoirs thus currently mitigate GHG emission when compared to the main alternative source of electricity with potentially far great reductions in GHG emissions and benefits possible through relatively minor changes to reservoir management and design. On average, the sum of drawdown and downstream emission including river reaches below dams and turbines, which is overlooked by most studies, represents the equivalent of 42\u00a0% of the CO2 and 92\u00a0% of CH4 that emit from hydroelectric reservoirs in China.

Although the physical and chemical basis for ocean acidification is well understood, there exist few field data of sufficient duration, resolution, and accuracy to document the acidification rate and to elucidate the factors governing its variability.

Superimposed upon this trend is a strong seasonal pH cycle driven by temperature, mixing, and net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. We also observe substantial interannual variability in surface pH, influenced by climate-induced fluctuations in upper ocean stability. Below the mixed layer, we find that the change in acidification is enhanced within distinct subsurface strata.

The extent of emissions reductions is most sensitive to the rate at which tax exemptions are removed. Recycling of carbon tax revenue reduces the extent of emissions reductions due to the fact that economic growth is supported.

This study evaluated the impact of lime and DCD on NH3 and N2O emissions following application of liquid hog manure. Hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) was added to an acidic soil to achieve three pH levels (4.7, 6.3 and 7.4).

Slurry was applied at a rate equivalent to 116,000 l ha\u22121, while DCD was applied at 30% of the NH4-N rate applied. Jars were sealed and incubated at 21\u00b0C for 21 d. Ammonia volatilisation was quantified using boric acid traps, while N2O gas concentration was analysed using gas chromatography. Dicyandiamide had no effect (P>0.05) on either NH3 or N2O emissions.

The range of possible effects arising from various future scenarios is analyzed, and tradeoffs between partially counteracting short- and long term effects are studied. Present-day global mean radiative forcing of short-lived species and CH4 is reduced when flying lower, whereas that of CO2 increases. The opposite effect is found for higher flight altitudes. For increasing and sustained emissions, the climate impact changes are dominated by the effect of short-lived species, yielding a reduction for lower flight altitudes and an increase for higher flight altitudes. For future scenarios involving a reduction or termination of emissions, radiative forcing of short-lived species decreases immediately, that of longer lived species decreases gradually, and respective temperature responses start to decay slowly. After disappearance of the shorter lived effects, only the counteracting CO2 effect remains, resulting in an increased climate effect for lower flight altitudes and a decrease for higher flight altitudes.

This paper uses a cumulative emissions approach to explore whether a consumption-based framing offers new opportunities and avenues for tackling climate change. Results reveal that there is still scope for emissions to remain within a budget associated with a high probability of remaining below the 2\u00b0C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels associated with \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change. However, both territorial and consumption-based approaches require a rethinking of the political orthodoxy for the highest probabilities of not exceeding 2\u00b0C. Using the consumption-based framework, mitigation policy in Annex 1 nations can address consumer-related emissions sending mitigation signals along supply chains and across national boundaries, thereby increasing their influence over global CO2. Ultimately, allying the cumulative framing of climate change with the consumption-based approach offers additional potential for achieving a global low-carbon transition compared with policies framed solely using the conventional territorial approach. Nevertheless, cumulative budgets associated with a high probability of not exceeding the 2\u00b0C threshold between \u2018dangerous\u2019 and \u2018acceptable\u2019 climate change demand immediate and urgent emission reductions, irrespective of the accounting approach employed.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "93b5d4edd90b509bdd0779c6266c24c4d4df59e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2738505447", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TRD.2017.07.004", "CorpusId": 157153305}, "title": "Explaining shipping company participation in voluntary vessel emission reduction programs", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ff783582f10b5803e0bf2d990e7025a37cd1b081", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2607172630", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-017-1964-6", "CorpusId": 158013723}, "title": "Low-emission pathways in 11 major economies: comparison of cost-optimal pathways and Paris climate proposals", "abstract": "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of climate policy, it is important to understand emission trends and policies at the national level.

Limiting global temperature increase to below 2\u00a0\u00b0C implies a substantial reduction of the estimated available carbon budget for each country. The national carbon budgets between 2010 and 2100 showed reductions between the baseline and the 2\u00a0\u00b0C consistent mitigation scenario ranging from 52% in South Korea to 95% in Brazil. While in the baseline scenario, the share of low-carbon primary energy sources is projected to remain around 15% (with Brazil being a notable exception, reaching 30%); in the mitigation scenarios, the share of low-carbon energy is projected to increase to over 50% in 2050 in nearly all countries, with the EU, Japan and Canada reaching the largest shares. Comparison with the (I)NDCs shows that in Brazil, Canada, the EU, Mexico (conditional target), South Korea and the USA, the emission reduction targets of the NDCs are closer to the mitigation requirement of the 2\u00a0\u00b0C scenario; in other countries, however, there is still a large gap.

Over the 21st century, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors, with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling. In climate change mitigation scenarios that apply a price to GHG emissions, mitigation of freight emissions (including the effects of demand elasticity, mode and technology shifting, and fuel substitution) is more limited than for other demand sectors. In such scenarios, shifting to less-emitting transportation modes and technologies is projected to play a relatively small role in reducing freight emissions in GCAM.

Recent GHG emission trends are consistent with worst-case scenarios of the previous decade. Dramatic and near-term emission reductions likely will be needed to ameliorate the potential deleterious impacts of climate change. To achieve such reductions, fundamental changes are required in the way that energy is generated and used. New technologies must be developed and deployed at a rapid rate. Advances in carbon capture and storage, renewable, nuclear, and transportation technologies are particularly important; however, global research and development efforts related to these technologies currently appear to fall short relative to needs. Even with a proactive and international mitigation effort, humanity will need to adapt to climate change, but the adaptation needs and damages will be far greater if mitigation activities are not pursued in earnest. In this review, research is highlighted that indicates increasing global and regional temperatures and ties climate changes to increasing GHG emissions. GHG mitigation targets necessary for limiting future global temperature increases are discussed, including how factors such as population growth and the growing energy intensity of the developing world will make these reduction targets more challenging. Potential technological pathways for meeting emission reduction targets are examined, barriers are discussed, and global and U.S. modeling results are presented that suggest that the necessary pathways will require radically transformed electric and mobile sectors. While geoengineering options have been proposed to allow more time for serious emission reductions, these measures are at the conceptual stage with many unanswered cost, environmental, and political issues.

Soil compaction in the middle of the wheel track caused a considerable increase of N 2 O emissions with values elevated by up to 40 times the uncompacted ones. Compaction reduced the CH 4 consumption at all sites by up to 90%, and at the silty clay loam site its effect was such that CH 4 was even released. These changes in N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes were caused by a reduction in macropore volume and an increase of the water-filled pore space (WFPS). Additionally, the slipping of the forwarder's wheels led to a mixing of the humus layer with the mineral soil, which resulted in a new layer. This layer reduced gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere. Trace gas fluxes were altered in the trafficked soil and in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant changes in the trace gas fluxes on the skid trails, the cumulative effect of the two gases on the atmosphere was small with respect to total emissions.

We present top-down constraints on global monthly N2O emissions for 2011 from a\u00a0multi-inversion approach and an ensemble of surface observations.

The strategies include (1) a\u00a0standard 4D-Var inversion at native model resolution (4\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u00b0), (2) an inversion for six continental and three ocean regions, and (3) a\u00a0fast 4D-Var inversion based on a\u00a0novel dimension reduction technique employing randomized singular value decomposition (SVD).

The NOx dependent SOA parametrization predicts a maximum average SOA concentration of 5.2 microg m(-3) and a domain average concentration of 0.6 microg m(-3). As the NOx emissions are reduced by 25%, the domain average SOA concentration does not significantly change, but the response is quite variable spatially. However, the predicted average SOA concentrations increase in northern US cities by around 3% but decrease in the rural southeast US by approximately 5%. A decrease of the average biogenic SOA by roughly 0.5 microg m(-3) is predicted for the southeast US for a 50% reduction in NOx emissions.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "848fb48ee7a2ee593bcee7a1c7c18b9359146adb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2767073904", "DOI": "10.1039/C7TC04168C", "CorpusId": 139934531}, "title": "An excellent cyan-emitting orthosilicate phosphor for NUV-pumped white LED application", "abstract": "In this paper, a cyan-emitting phosphor BLS:Ce3+ is reported that has a broad emission band covering both the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum, which can be used instead of two separate blue and green phosphors. The excitation peak of BLS:Ce3+ is located at 400 nm, which matches well with the emission light of efficient near-ultraviolet (NUV) chips. The BLS:Ce3+ phosphor has an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) higher than 90% at room temperature (RT) and an excellent thermal stability (a small reduction of 3% at 150 \u00b0C relative to the IQE at RT) and is environmentally robust (a small degradation of 6% occurs after aging for 1600 h at 85 \u00b0C/85% RH relative to the room-temperature IQE value). Using the BLS:Ce3+ phosphor, coupled only with a CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ red phosphor and a 395 nm NUV chip, a NUV-based WLED with a high color rendering index of 90.6 has been achieved.

Autoradiographic studies in rhesus monkey brain showed that [18F]MK-9470 binding is aligned with the reported distribution of CB1 receptors with high specific binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys showed high brain uptake and a distribution pattern generally consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. Uptake was blocked by pretreatment with a potent CB1 inverse agonist, MK-0364. The ratio of total to nonspecific binding in putamen was 4\u20135:1, indicative of a strong specific signal that was confirmed to be reversible via displacement studies with MK-0364. Baseline PET imaging studies in human research subject demonstrated behavior of [18F]MK-9470 very similar to that seen in monkeys, with very good test\u2013retest variability (7%). Proof of concept studies in healthy young male human subjects showed that MK-0364, given orally, produced a dose-related reduction in [18F]MK-9470 binding reflecting CB1R receptor occupancy by the drug. Thus, [18F]MK-9470 has the potential to be a valuable, noninvasive research tool for the in vivo study of CB1R biology and pharmacology in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.

Optimum self-locking ranges for improving the timing stability by dual-cavity optical feedback are identified. A timing jitter reduction and an increase of the repetition rate tuning range of up to a factor of three, compared with single-cavity feedback, are predicted for the parameter ranges investigated. Improved timing stability on short and long timescales is predicted for dual-cavity feedback through the suppression of noise-induced fluctuations.

The assessment is based on estimates of aerosol optical depths over China, the effect of these optical depths on the solar irradiance reaching the earth's surface, and the response of rice and winter wheat grown in Nanjing to the change in solar irradiance. Two sets of aerosol optical depths are presented: one based on a coupled, regional climate/air quality model simulation and the other inferred from solar radiation measurements made over a 12-year period at meteorological stations in China. The model-estimated optical depths are significantly smaller than those derived from observations, perhaps because of errors in one or both sets of optical depths or because the data from the meteorological stations has been affected by local pollution. Radiative transfer calculations using the smaller, model-estimated aerosol optical depths indicate that the so-called \"direct effect\" of regional haze results in an approximately 5-30% reduction in the solar irradiance reaching some of China's most productive agricultural regions. Crop-response model simulations suggest an approximately 1:1 relationship between a percentage increase (decrease) in total surface solar irradiance and a percentage increase (decrease) in the yields of rice and wheat. Collectively, these calculations suggest that regional haze in China is currently depressing optimal yields of approximately 70% of the crops grown in China by at least 5-30%. Reducing the severity of regional haze in China through air pollution control could potentially result in a significant increase in crop yields and help the nation meet its growing food demands in the coming decades.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "7eb9eeceb470e5496d814b7d8b940e0d4ac032da", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1979549061", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.89.20.9588", "CorpusId": 27053799, "PubMed": "1409670"}, "title": "Reductive detoxification as a mechanism of fungal resistance to singlet oxygen-generating photosensitizers.", "abstract": "Fungi that are resistant or sensitive to the singlet oxygen-generating toxin cercosporin were assayed for their ability to detoxify it by reduction. Cercosporin reduction was assayed microscopically by using bandpass filters to differentiate between fluorescence emission from cercosporin and reduced cercosporin. Hyphae of the resistant Cercospora and Alternaria species emitted a green fluorescence, indicative of reduced cercosporin. Hyphae of nonviable cultures and of cercosporin-sensitive fungi did not reduce cercosporin. Sensitive fungi occasionally reduced cercosporin when incubated with reducing agents that protect against cercosporin toxicity. Cercosporin could not be efficiently photoreduced in the absence of the fungus. Cercospora species were also resistant to eosin Y but were sensitive to rose bengal. Microscopic observation demonstrated that Cercospora species were not capable of reducing rose bengal but were capable of reducing eosin Y. These observations were supported by in vitro electrochemical measurements that revealed the following order with respect to ease of reduction: cercosporin >> eosin Y > rose bengal. The formal redox potential (E 0') of cercosporin at pH 7.5 was found to be -0.14 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode. We conclude that Cercospora species protect themselves against cercosporin by the reduction and detoxification of the toxin molecule.", "year": 1992}]}
