Both ex vivo experiments comparing cancer cell models to normal cells and in vivo imaging of subcutaneous xenografted tumor (cervical carcinoma model) in nude mice established the validity of this strategy for precise and selective imaging of cells and tumors.

Previous studies of RCCI combustion using port-injected low-reactivity fuel (e.g., gasoline or iso-octane) and direct-injected high-reactivity fuel (e.g., diesel or n-heptane) have reported greater than 56% gross indicated thermal efficiency while meeting the EPA 2010 heavy-duty PM and NOx emissions regulations in-cylinder. However, CO and UHC emissions were higher than in diesel combustion. This increase is thought to be caused by crevice flows of trapped low-reactivity fuel and lower cylinder wall temperatures. In the present study, both the low- and high-reactivity fuels were direct-injected, enabling more precise targeting of the low-reactivity fuel as well as independent stratification of equivalence ratio and reactivity. Experiments with direct-injection of both gasoline and diesel were conducted at 9 bar IMEP and compared to results from experiments with port-injected gasoline and direct-injected diesel at matched conditions. The results indicate that reductions in UHC, CO, and PM are possible with direct-injected gasoline, while maintaining similar gross indicated efficiency as well as NOx emissions well below the EPA 2010 heavy-duty limit. Additionally, experimental results were simulated using multi-dimensional modeling in the KIVA-3V code coupled to a Discrete Multi-Component fuel vaporization model. The simulations suggest that further UHC reductions can be made by using wider injector angles which direct the gasoline spray away from the crevices.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a1e8a109f5ea4b19bea510b1773c1861d5b5fe56", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2969664699", "DOI": "10.1186/s12544-019-0377-1", "CorpusId": 201098481}, "title": "Modelling the impacts of EU countries\u2019 electric car deployment plans on atmospheric emissions and concentrations", "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to quantify key environmental impacts of electric vehicles deployment in the European Union.

The main sources of the anthropogenic emissions are fossil fuel consumption and industrial processes. In this study, the atmospheric compounds affecting the acidification in Finland have been investigated from different viewpoints. The geographical distribution, temporal trends and episodicity describe the regional and temporal variations, while the exposure and modelled values illustrate the impact of the different air transport directions or emission areas. In Finland, the SO 2 emissions and concentrations in the background areas have decreased by more than 80% since 1981. The reductions of sulphate concentrations in air and precipitation have been lower due to the dominance of the long range transport. The gas phase and particulate nitrogen compounds showed few significant trends in the 1990's. A steep decline in the atmospheric base cation deposition was discovered especially in the southeastern part of the country. From the Finnish perspective, the emissions of SO 2 are largest in the countries to the south as well as to the southwest and west of Finland. The frequent transport from these sectors together with the lower SO 2 emission reductions, especially in the southern sector, have contributed to the lower reductions in the sulphate concentrations. The highest sulphur dioxide and particulate sulphate concentrations in southern and central Finland originate from the sectors between south and east, while the transport is most frequent from the western sectors. Thus, the atmospheric sulphur exposure is highly affected by transport with the cleaner westerly winds, although the highest concentrations also have a remarkable effect on the mean concentration level. In the north, the transport from northeastern and northern sectors is also important for the exposure. From the Finnish perspective, the nitrogen oxide emissions are highest in the countries in the southwestern and western sectors. There the reduction has been lower than the average in the area contributing to the deposition in Finland. The frequent transport from these areas has highly affected the Finnish concentrations and exposure.

Jost [1] concluded that studies carried out in several industrial countries indicate that 1.0 to 1.4 % of the gross national product can be saved by introducing better tribological practices, requiring investment in research and development at a rate of one in 50 of the savings obtainable. Today, considerable effort is being devoted to producing increasingly more energy efficient vehicles and machines, not only for economic reasons, but also to help meet the requirements for reduced CO2 emissions arising from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. A major source of CO2 emissions are cars and trucks. Transportation consumes about 20 % of the global primary energy and accounts for about 18 % of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [2,3]. In this paper we summarize our studies for calculating the global energy consumption due to friction and potential savings from friction reduction in transportation and in industry [4-6].

The time value of money and depreciation scale were used to find out the real levellized cost of electricity generation of gasification plants. Then, the costs of electricity generation fuelled by pine needles and coal were estimated using the cost analysis method. Our results indicate that pine needles would have more competitive edge than coal if emission had taxed at about an emission tax INR 525.15 Mg-1 of CO2 (US$ 8.4), or higher would be needed for pine needles at a yield of 202.176 dry Mg hm-2 yr.

The aim of this work was to simulate future scenarios of downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) epidemics on grape under climate change, by combining a disease model to output from two general circulation models (GCMs). Model runs corresponding to the SRES\u2010A2 emissions scenario, characterized by high projections of both population and greenhouse gas emissions from present to 2100, were chosen in order to investigate impacts of worst\u2010case scenarios, among those currently available from IPCC.

Both GCMs predicted increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation in this region. The simulations obtained by combining the disease model to the two GCM outputs predicted an increase of the disease pressure in each decade: more severe epidemics were a direct consequence of more favourable temperature conditions during the months of May and June. These negative effects of increasing temperatures more than counterbalanced the effects of precipitation reductions, which alone would have diminished disease pressure. Results suggested that, as adaptation response to future climate change, more attention would have to be paid in the management of early downy mildew infections; two more fungicide sprays were necessary under the most negative climate scenario, compared with present management regimes.

Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), member countries are allocated national emission quotas which they further distribute among their individual industry sectors. Within the UK, the electricity generation industry already plays a significant role in the reduction of green house emissions. Emissions trading mechanisms should make it more attractive to build capacity in renewable and cleaner generation than buying rights to emit since more still needs to be done to reduce emissions. To achieve this it is essential that the right emission quotas are allocated for different industries. The amount of emissions to be allocated to the generation industry must therefore be consistent with the desired emissions reduction target and the current technological status of the generation mix. The allocation must also take into account the relative costs of cleaner and renewable generation technologies that are commercially available and those in developments. This paper proposes an approach for determining the emissions allocation for the generation industry to achieve a given emission reduction target. The paper draws on previous work on valuing emissions from electricity generation and building a sustainable generation mix in a competitive environment. Studies were carried out with seven generation technologies.

First-generation biofuels are not the solution to global transport energy needs; however, biodiesel does have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector, so long as necessary production can be achieved in a sustainable manner without negative impact on plant and animal biodiversity. The biodiesel content within diesel sold to consumers is set to increase in the future, with implications on vehicle fuel consumption, emissions, and base engine durability. This study examines the effects of increasing the biodiesel blend ratio on the performance and emissions of a production vehicle equipped with a common-rail direct-injection diesel engine, evaluated on a chassis rolls dynamometer, at various ambient temperatures. Results obtained show that reductions in engine-out carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions do not always translate to lower tailpipe emissions as reduced exhaust gas temperatures at higher blend ratios lead to reduced catalyst conversion efficiencies and higher total cycle emissions. Catalyst conversion efficiencies for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) are reduced by 9\u201319 per cent (depending on the ambient temperature) for a 50:50 blend (B50) compared with the petroleum diesel (B0) baseline. Increasing the blend ratio caused a linear decrease in the vehicle's maximum tractive force. This reduction was of the order of 5 per cent for a B50 blend at low vehicle speeds and 6\u201310 per cent at higher speeds, which is greater than would be expected on the basis of the differences in calorific values.

Interestingly, this assessment was premised exclusively on technical (engineering) measures, but ignored completely the behavioural and lifestyle dimensions of energy consumption in the buildings sector. Behavioural change in buildings, however, can deliver even faster and zero-cost improvements in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission reductions. With this in mind, designers are beginning to shift their attention to how they can widen the range of opportunities available in a building to provide comfort for the occupants, both in new-build and retrofit contexts. This in turn has re-awakened an interest in the role of natural ventilation in the provision of comfort. This discussion about adaptive comfort raises several questions, including the following: How can we shift occupants' comfort expectations away from the static indoor climates of the past towards the more variable thermal regimes found in naturally ventilated buildings? Are building occupants \u2018addicted\u2019 to static environments, i.e. air-conditioning (AC)? If so, how tolerant or compliant will they be when the thermally constant conditions provided by AC are replaced by the thermally variable conditions that characterize naturally ventilated spaces? Does the frequency of prior exposure to AC bias building occupants' thermal expectations and, if so, what are the implications of this bias for their acceptance of naturally ventilated indoor climates? Does prior exposure to AC lead building occupants to actually prefer AC over natural ventilation?

The impact of ship emissions on tropospheric oxidants is mainly caused by the relatively large fraction of NOx in ship exhaust. Typical increases in yearly average surface ozone concentrations in the most impacted areas are 0.5-2.5 ppbv. The global annual mean radiative forcing due to ozone increases in the troposphere is 10 mWm(-2) over the period 2000-2007. We find global average tropospheric OH increase of 1.03% over the same period. As a result of this the global average tropospheric methane concentration is reduced by approximately 2.2% over a period corresponding to the turnover time. The resulting methane radiative forcing is -14 mWm(-2) with an additional contribution of -6 mWm(-2) from methane induced reduction in ozone. The net forcing of the ozone and methane changes due to ship emissions changes between 2000 and 2007 is -10 mWm(-2). This is significant compared to the net forcing of these components in 2000. Our findings support earlier observational studies indicating that ship traffic may be a major contributor to recent enhancement of background ozone at some coastal stations.

In this paper, we present measurements and simulations of RTS noise in small-area MOSFETs under constant bias and switched gate bias conditions in order to investigate the impact of substrate bias on RTS noise. Our results show that a strong reduction of RTS noise under switching bias conditions is obtained when a forward substrate bias is applied during the device off-state.

Private initiatives can reduce carbon emissions without the coercive power or resources of government by correcting market and behavioral failures and by drawing on the support for mitigation that exists in a subset of the population. The Article demonstrates how a private governance wedge of emissions reductions can be achieved by expanding current corporate and household private governance initiatives and by launching new initiatives that address climate beliefs, motivations, and behavior.

Specifically, it provides an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, will have on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of poverty eradication (SDG1) and reduced income inequality (SDG10). By combining an empirical analysis with a modelling exercise, the paper estimates the future trends of poverty prevalence and inequality across countries in a reference scenario and under a climate mitigation policy with alternative revenue recycling schemes. Our results suggest that a full implementation of the emission reduction contributions, stated in the NDCs, is projected to slow down the effort to reduce poverty by 2030 (+2% of the population below the poverty line compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher policy costs. Conversely, countries with a stringent mitigation policy experience a reduction of inequality compared to baseline scenario levels. If financial support for mitigation action in developing countries is provided through an international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly reduced at the aggregate level (185,000fewer poor people with respect to the mitigation scenario), but the country-specific effect depends on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on their economic structure.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "96a32c92b52b363dd3148010d7b2d20bde31f707", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2029043788", "DOI": "10.1021/jo2004764", "CorpusId": 10603909, "PubMed": "21539382"}, "title": "Solution processable indoloquinoxaline derivatives containing bulky polyaromatic hydrocarbons: synthesis, optical spectra, and electroluminescence.", "abstract": "New hybrid materials featuring the dipolar fragment 6H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline attached to the bulkier polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as fluoranthene, triphenylene, or polyphenylated benzene have been synthesized by a two-step procedure involving Sonogashira and Diels-Alder reactions.

The study consisted of four treatments: unplanted and N-unfertilized soil (U0), unplanted soil treated with 225\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u2009ha\u22121 (UN), maize planted and N-unfertilized soil (P0), and planted soil fertilized with 225\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u2009ha\u22121 (PN). Soil CO2 and N2O fluxes were measured using the static closed chamber method.Results and discussionCumulative CO2 emissions during the maize growing season with the U0, UN, P0, and PN treatments were 1.29, 1.04, 2.30 and 2.27\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121, respectively, indicating that N fertilization significantly reduced the decomposition of native SOC. However, no marked effect on soil respiration in planted soil was observed because the increase of rhizosphere respiration caused by N addition was counteracted by the reduction of native SOC decomposition. Soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature but not by soil moisture. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration was 2.16\u20132.47 for unplanted soil but increased to 3.16\u20133.44 in planted soil. N addition reduced the Q10 of native SOC decomposition possibly due to low labile organic C but increased the Q10 of soil respiration due to the stimulation of maize growth. The estimated annual CO2 emission in N-fertilized soil was 1.28\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u2009ha\u22121 and was replenished by the residual stubble, roots, and exudates. In contrast, the lost C (1.53\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u2009ha\u22121) in N-unfertilized soil was not completely supplemented by maize residues, resulting in a reduction of SOC. Although N fertilization significantly increased N2O emissions, the global warming potential of N2O and CO2 emissions in N-fertilized soil was significantly lower than in N-unfertilized soil.ConclusionsThe stimulatory or inhibitory effect of N fertilization on soil respiration and basal respiration may depend on labile organic C concentration in soil. The inhibitory effect of N fertilization on native SOC decomposition was mainly associated with low labile organic C in tested black soil.

Multi-objective optimization was carried out for maximizing the airfoil lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) and minimizing the sound pressure level. With two above objective functions and by defining decision variables along with introducing physical and engineering constraints, genetic algorithm method was applied for optimization process. Moreover, \u2018Fuzzy Bellman-Zadeh\u2019 decision-making method was applied for selecting final optimal point from Pareto front. The results of this new method of airfoil shape analysis at various wind velocities showed about 26% average increase in CL/CD and 1.11% average decrease in noise emission in comparison with that for typical highly used S822 airfoil in small wind turbines.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "3c21ea70f25d30d3d5fab7e1b75e86f8ac967309", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2030636121", "DOI": "10.2527/jas.2008-1026", "CorpusId": 17159847, "PubMed": "19028842"}, "title": "Effect of DL-malic acid supplementation on feed intake, methane emission, and rumen fermentation in beef cattle.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary concentration of dl-malic acid (MA) on DMI, CH(4) emission, and rumen fermentation in beef cattle. Two Latin square experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, six beef heifers (19 +/- 1 mo old) were assigned in a duplicated Latin square to 1 of 3 dietary concentrations of MA on a DMI basis (0%, MA-0; 3.75%, MA-3.75; or 7.5%, MA-7.5) over 3 periods. In Exp. 2, four rumen-fistulated steers (48 +/- 1 mo old) were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary concentrations of MA (0%, MA-0; 2.5%, MA-2.5; 5.0%, MA-5.0; or 7.5%, MA-7.5) on a DMI basis, over 4 periods. Both experimental diets consisted of grass silage and pelleted concentrate (containing MA). Silage was fed ad libitum once daily (a.m.), whereas concentrate was fed twice daily (a.m. and p.m.) with the aim of achieving a total DMI of 40:60 silage:concentrate. In both Exp. 1 and 2, experimental periods consisted of 28 d, incorporating a 13-d acclimatization, a 5-d measurement period, and a 10-d washout period. In Exp. 1, enteric CH(4), feed apparent digestibility, and feed intake were measured over the 5-d measurement period. In Exp. 2, rumen fluid was collected on d 16 to 18, immediately before (a.m.) feeding and 2, 4, 6, and 8 h thereafter. Rumen pH was determined and samples were taken for protozoa count, VFA, and ammonia analysis. Enteric CH(4) emissions were estimated by using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique and feed apparent digestibility was estimated by using chromic oxide as an external marker for fecal output. In Exp. 1, increasing dietary MA led to a linear decrease in total DMI (P < 0.001) and total daily CH(4) emissions (P < 0.001). Compared with the control diet, the greatest concentration of MA decreased total daily CH(4) emissions by 16%, which corresponded to a 9% reduction per unit of DMI. Similarly, in Exp. 2, inclusion of MA reduced DMI in a linear (P = 0.002) and quadratic (P < 0.001) fashion. Increasing dietary MA led to a linear decrease in molar proportion of acetic (P = 0.004) and butyric acids (P < 0.001) and an increase in propionic acid (P < 0.001). Ruminal pH tended to increase (P = 0.10) with increasing dietary MA. Dietary inclusion of MA led to a linear (P = 0.01) decrease in protozoa numbers. Increasing supplementation with MA decreased CH(4) emissions, but DMI was also decreased, which could have potentially negative effects on animal performance.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "14645cc9028fc9b6632d5b4acc80fec690a69f87", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2095765877", "DOI": "10.1109/NSSMIC.2002.1239601", "CorpusId": 72942360}, "title": "Anatomical based FDG-PET reconstruction for the detection of hypometabolic regions in epilepsy", "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) of the cerebral glucose metabolism has shown to be useful in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy.

The following results were obtained. (1) Nuclear density estimation shows that the overall average carbon intensity of cities in China has decreased, with differences gradually narrowing. (2) The spatial autocorrelation Moran\u2019s I index indicates significant spatial agglomeration of carbon emission intensity is gradually increasing; however, differences between regions have remained stable. (3) Spatial Markov chain analysis shows a Matthew effect in China\u2019s urban carbon emission intensity. In addition, low-intensity and high-intensity cities characteristically maintain their initial state during the transition period. Furthermore, there is a clear \u201cSpatial Spillover\u201d effect in urban carbon emission intensity and there is heterogeneity in the spillover effect in different regional contexts; that is, if a city is near a city with low carbon emission intensity, the carbon emission intensity of the first city has a higher probability of upward transfer, and vice versa. (4) Panel quantile results indicate that in cities with low carbon emission intensity, economic growth, technological progress, and appropriate population density play an important role in reducing emissions. In addition, foreign investment intensity and traffic emissions are the main factors that increase carbon emission intensity. In cities with high carbon intensity, population density is an important emission reduction factor, and technological progress has no significant effect. In contrast, industrial emissions, extensive capital investment, and urban land expansion are the main factors driving the increase in carbon intensity.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "a82faaa827bbbd121ec21219bdd732bbf72f5b6a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2109867326", "DBLP": "journals/tvt/ZhangLG14", "DOI": "10.1109/TVT.2013.2276432", "CorpusId": 1150208}, "title": "Varying-Domain Optimal Management Strategy for Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicles", "abstract": "In this paper, a management strategy is developed to realize the real-time optimal torque distribution between the internal combustion (IC) engine and the electric motor of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

Acute and chronic exposures to particulate matter are associated with a range of diseases, including chronic bronchitis and asthma, as well as premature deaths from cardiopulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute lower respiratory infections. The transportation sector accounted for approximately 19 percent of global black carbon emissions in the year 2000.

It presents a summary of emissions control approaches from developed countries, while recognizing that developing countries face a number of on-the-ground implementation challenges. This study applies a new cost-benefit analysis methodology to four simulated diesel black carbon emissions control projects - diesel retrofit in Istanbul, green freight (plus retrofit) in Sao Paulo, fuel and vehicle standards in Jakarta, and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in Cebu taking into account the additional climate benefits of black carbon reductions. While this report focuses on quantifying just the health and climate benefits of transport interventions, it also serves to highlight the challenges that can be faced when undertaking more comprehensive evaluation of transport projects. A cost-benefit framework for economic analysis of diesel black carbon emissions control transport projects is also presented that factors in both climate and health benefits.

The cities studied are namely the Athens and Thessaloniki Metropolitan Areas (AMA and TMA, respectively). PM(10) concentrations during the period 2001-2010 have been evaluated for 15 air quality monitoring stations in the two urban areas. It was found that the concentrations of PM(10) during the period studied constantly exceeded the threshold values at the traffic and industrial stations in TMA and most of the traffic sites in AMA. Most of the occurrences of non-attainment to the daily AQSs were observed during the winter period at all stations (more pronounced for TMA stations). The reduction in current emission source strength to meet the air quality goal was calculated by the rollback equation using PM(10) day-averaged concentrations over the selected period at each station. Among the lognormal and Weibull distributions, the lognormal distribution was found to best fit the frequency distributions of PM(10) concentrations at the selected stations. The results showed that the minimum reduction required in order to meet the AQS in the AMA ranges from approximately 20 to 38% and up to 11% for traffic and background stations, respectively. Reductions in the range of 31% for traffic and 44% for industrial areas in TMA are also required. The same methodology was applied to PM(2.5) concentrations in the AMA and showed that emission reductions up to 31% are necessary in order to meet the 2020 EU AQS.

The light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 uptake became progressively inhibited with decreased leaf water potential both at high, and especially, at low intercellular CO2 pressure. The maximal quantum yield of CO2 uptake was more resistant. The inhibition of light-saturated CO2 uptake at leaf water potentials around-10 bar, measured at a natural ambient CO2 concentration, was equally attributable to stomatal and non-stomatal factors, but the further inhibition below this water-stress level was caused solely by non-stomatal factors. The kinetics of fluorescence emission was changed at severe water stress; the slow secondary oscillations of the induction curve were attenuated, and this probably indicates perturbations in the carbon reduction cycle. The influence of light level during the drought period was also studied.

Particularly, a laser at the 730 nm band was realized in 0.1 mM Chla with a lasing threshold of only 8 \u03bcJ mm(-2). Additionally, we observed lasing competition between the two lasing bands. The presence of laser emission at the 680 nm band can lead to quenching or significant reduction of laser emission at the 730 nm band, effectively increasing the lasing threshold for the 730 nm band. Further concentration-dependent studies, along with theoretical analysis, elucidated the mechanism that determines when and why the laser emission band appears at one of the two bands, or concomitantly at both bands.

We connect models of macroeconomic activity, freight demand by commodity, transportation networks, and emission technology to represent different pathways of future freight emissions. Emissions of particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and total hydrocarbon (THC) decrease by 60%-70% from 2010 to 2030, as older vehicles built to less-stringent emission standards retire. Climate policy, in the form of carbon tax that increases apparent fuel prices, causes a shift from truck to rail, resulting in a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and a 10%-28% reduction in pollutant emissions by 2050, if rail capacity is sufficient. Eliminating high-emitting conditions in the truck fleet affects air pollutants by 20% to 65%; although these estimates are highly uncertain, they indicate the importance of durability in vehicle engines and emission control systems.

In order to reach the ambiguous mitigation scenarios for greenhouse gases, strong efforts are to be undertaken. Electric vehicles are seen as a potential mean to reduce emissions and energy import dependencies of most western societies. So far, the progress toward more electric vehicles in individual passenger transport is still slow. The objective to increase the share of electric vehicles of many national governments seems to be rather ambitious. In commercial transport, mileage is usually higher, trips are planned more precisely, and driving patterns are more regular than those of private vehicles. With these and other promising factors, we assume a high potential of electric vehicles in commercial transport. Therefore, we analyze in this paper the commercial transport in Germany and especially the large share of light commercial vehicles in order to make these potentials explicit. Based on German survey data, we analyze the heterogeneous German economic sectors with top-down statistical values like daily distance categories and bottom-up values like driving and parking behaviors.

The Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE) campaign took place in and around the Kathmandu Valley and in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of southern Nepal during April\u00a02015. The source characterization phase targeted numerous important but undersampled (and often inefficient) combustion sources that are widespread in the developing world such as cooking with a variety of stoves and solid fuels, brick kilns, open burning of municipal solid waste (a.k.a. trash or garbage burning), crop residue burning, generators, irrigation pumps, and motorcycles. NAMaSTE produced the first, or rare, measurements of aerosol optical properties, aerosol mass, and detailed trace gas chemistry for the emissions from many of the sources. This paper reports the trace gas and aerosol measurements obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, whole-air sampling (WAS), and photoacoustic extinctiometers (PAX; 405 and 870\u202fnm) based on field work with a moveable lab sampling authentic sources. The primary aerosol optical properties reported include emission factors (EFs) for scattering and absorption coefficients (EF Bscat, EF Babs, in\u202fm2\u202fkg\u22121 fuel burned), single scattering albedos (SSAs), and absorption Angstrom exponents (AAEs). From these data we estimate black and brown carbon (BC, BrC) emission factors (g\u202fkg\u22121 fuel burned). The trace gas measurements provide EFs (g\u202fkg\u22121) for CO2, CO, CH4, selected non-methane hydrocarbons up to C10, a large suite of oxygenated organic compounds, NH3, HCN, NOx, SO2, HCl, HF, etc. (up to \u223c\u200980\u00a0gases in all). The emissions varied significantly by source, and light absorption by both BrC and BC was important for many sources. The AAE for dung-fuel cooking fires (4.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.68) was significantly higher than for wood-fuel cooking fires (3.01\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10). Dung-fuel cooking fires also emitted high levels of NH3 (3.00\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.33\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121), organic acids (7.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.90\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121), and HCN (2.01\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.25\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121), where the latter could contribute to satellite observations of high levels of HCN in the lower stratosphere above the Asian monsoon. HCN was also emitted in significant quantities by several non-biomass burning sources. BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) were major emissions from both dung- (\u223c\u202f4.5\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121) and wood-fuel (\u223c\u202f1.5\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121) cooking fires, and a simple method to estimate indoor exposure to the many measured important air toxics is described. Biogas emerged as the cleanest cooking technology of approximately a dozen stove\u2013fuel combinations measured. Crop residue burning produced relatively high emissions of oxygenated organic compounds (\u223c\u202f12\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121) and SO2 (2.54\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.09\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121). Two brick kilns co-firing different amounts of biomass with coal as the primary fuel produced contrasting results. A zigzag kiln burning mostly coal at high efficiency produced larger amounts of BC, HF, HCl, and NOx, with the halogenated emissions likely coming from the clay. The clamp kiln (with relatively more biomass fuel) produced much greater quantities of most individual organic gases, about twice as much BrC, and significantly more known and likely organic aerosol precursors. Both kilns were significant SO2 sources with their emission factors averaging 12.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121. Mixed-garbage burning produced significantly more BC (3.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.88\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121) and BTEX (\u223c\u202f4.5\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121) emissions than in previous measurements. For all fossil fuel sources, diesel burned more efficiently than gasoline but produced larger NOx and aerosol emission factors. Among the least efficient sources sampled were gasoline-fueled motorcycles during start-up and idling for which the CO EF was on the order of \u223c\u202f700\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 \u2013 or about 10 times that of a typical biomass fire. Minor motorcycle servicing led to minimal if any reduction in gaseous pollutants but reduced particulate emissions, as detailed in a companion paper (Jayarathne et al., 2016). A small gasoline-powered generator and an \u201cinsect repellent fire\u201d were also among the sources with the highest emission factors for pollutants. These measurements begin to address the critical data gap for these important, undersampled sources, but due to their diversity and abundance, more work is needed.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "17695850b615a31d7f7e0753d7a98e3eee405c2b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025909029", "DOI": "10.1021/IE020157V", "CorpusId": 95408527}, "title": "Pt/Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 Washcoated Monoliths for Automotive Emission Control", "abstract": "A three-way model catalyst has been prepared with 0.58 wt% Pt on Ce 0.68 Zr 0.32 O 2 mixed oxide washcoated on a ceramic monolith.

To this end, this article presents an overall integrated model that solves simultaneously the refinery planning, hydrogen, and CO2 management problems. It addresses the optimum CO2 strategy selection through integration of refinery planning with the hydrogen network and CO2 emissions. The overall model was formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The model consists of the refinery emission sources and the considered mitigation options. Model performance was tested through different case studies with various reduction targets. The optimization results showed that the integration of the planning, hydrogen, and CO2 models lead to better profit margins and that CO2 mitigation options worked successfully together to meet a given reduction target. The obtained results also showed that the load shifting option can contribute up to a 3% reduction of CO2 emissions, while the fuel switching option can provide a 20% reduction.

The application of PCCC technology to reduce CO2 emissions at large point sources, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants is particularly promising. Amine-based scrubbing is the most mature PCCC technology, with 2-aminoethanol (MEA) the most widely utilized solvent. Despite the use of water wash systems to treat effluent, small amounts of the solvent and degradation products are present in amine-based PCCC plant emissions. Recently, concerns have arisen that emissions from PCCC plants could be harmful to human health and the environment. Of particular interest are nitrosamine and nitramine degradation products, many of which are known carcinogens. Degradation products, including nitrosamines and nitramines, will form in PCCC plants from reactions between the amine solvent and NOx species in the flue gas. For primary amine solvents (e.g., MEA), nitrosamines can only be formed indirectly from other degradation products. Solvents with secondary and tertiary amine functionalities (e.g., piperazine and N-methyldiethanolamine) can directly form stable nitrosamines. Nitramines can form directly from primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. However, there is currently limited emission data available for PCCC plants. This problem is compounded by the fact that emission composition and levels will depend significantly on the flue gas being processed, choice of solvent, and plant operation conditions. Emission levels in the range of 2\u221250 ng/Nm have been reported for both nitrosamines and nitramines at a pilot PCCC plant operating with MEA. These results, together with other reports of nitrosamines detected at pilot PCCC plants and in laboratory experiments, suggest low but quantifiable emissions of nitrosamines and nitramines. In addition to the formation of nitrosamines and nitramines within PCCC plants, it is also possible for these compounds to form through the atmospheric photooxidation of the amine solvent present in the emissions. Steady state conversion rates of amines to nitrosamines and nitramines have been reported for a variety of atmospheric conditions. Steady state nitrosamine yields for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) were reported to be <0.6% of the amine concentration in a rural scenario and <2.3% in an urban scenario. Similar yields were reported for other nitrosamines and nitramines. The formation of nitrosamines and nitramines can therefore occur both in a PCCC plant and in the atmosphere. Relatively little is known about the potential impacts of PCCC-related emissions on human health and the environment. Compounds emitted from the plant or formed in the atmosphere will disperse and deposit to terrestrial and aquatic environments as either wet or dry aerosols. Preliminary studies have indicated that both nitrosamines and nitramines will partition preferentially to the water phase rather than adsorb to soils and sediments. It seems likely that these compounds will therefore reach an aqueous compartment (e.g., drinking water, groundwater). The biodegradability of nitrosamines and nitramines influences their potential for accumulation in aquatic matrices and ultimately their human and environmental exposure. Initial studies indicate biodegradation of nitrosamines and nitramines is complex, differing significantly between compounds and dependent upon environmental conditions and compound concentration. In general neither nitrosamines nor nitramines seem susceptible to rapid aerobic aqueous biodegradation indicating the possibility of accumulation in these environmental matrices. Owing to their hydrophilic nature, we do not expect nitrosamines and nitramines to bioaccumulate significantly in organisms; however, there seems to be potential for chronic exposure. To determine acceptable PCCC plant emission levels it is important to consider both the environmental fate of the emissions and the acceptable exposure levels. The Norwegian Public Health Institute (NPHI) has proposed acceptable exposure levels of 4 ng/L (drinking water) and 0.3 ng/m (air concentration) based on 10\u22126 lifetime risk of cancer following exposure to the nitrosamine, NDMA. The NPHI assessment assumes all nitrosamines and nitramines are as carcinogenic as NDMA, which is considered one of the most carcinogenic nitrosamines. The carcinogenicity of nitramines is generally much lower, but insufficient data are available to propose reliable exposure limits. Other existing safety limits for nitrosamines and nitramines following exposure by inhalation, drinking water and to the aquatic environment range from 0.02 ng/m (inhalation; monthly average) to 7 ng/L (drinking water) for nitrosamines, and from 200 ng/L (aquatic", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "eb7ab7fa473bc164129f7cca413c3f118559773f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1584892067", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1009651316596", "CorpusId": 153803424}, "title": "The Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Verification of Climate Change Projects", "abstract": "Because of concerns with the growing threat of global climate change from increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, the United States and other countries are implementing, by themselves or in cooperation with one or more other nations, climate change projects.

First, the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is applied to find the similar characteristics in emissions among 30 provinces. The clustering results of CO2 emissions indicate that the 30 provinces are divided into five clusters in 1997 and seven clusters in 2012 based on four indicators (generation structure, energy intensity, GDP per capita and electricity intensity). Then, the regional differences in driving forces on CO2 emissions from power industry are examined using refined Laspeyres decomposition model. Results showed that there are significant contribution differences of five indicators (power generation emission coefficient, generation structure, electricity intensity, economy and population) on power generation emissions among different provinces.

Plant growth stimulation and alterations of fungal community composition and functions are the main mechanisms driving soil C gains following N deposition in N\u2010limited temperate forests. In N\u2010rich tropical forests, however, N deposition generally has minor effects on plant growth; consequently, C storage in soil may strongly depend on the microbial processes that drive litter and soil organic matter decomposition. Here, we investigated how microbial functions in old\u2010growth tropical forest soil responded to 13 years of N addition at four rates: 0 (Control), 50 (Low\u2010N), 100 (Medium\u2010N), and 150 (High\u2010N) kg N ha\u22121 year\u22121. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased under High\u2010N, corresponding to a 33% decrease in CO2 efflux, and reductions in relative abundances of bacteria as well as genes responsible for cellulose and chitin degradation. A 113% increase in N2O emission was positively correlated with soil acidification and an increase in the relative abundances of denitrification genes (narG and norB). Soil acidification induced by N addition decreased available P concentrations, and was associated with reductions in the relative abundance of phytase. The decreased relative abundance of bacteria and key functional gene groups for C degradation were related to slower SOC decomposition, indicating the key mechanisms driving SOC accumulation in the tropical forest soil subjected to High\u2010N addition. However, changes in microbial functional groups associated with N and P cycling led to coincidentally large increases in N2O emissions, and exacerbated soil P deficiency. These two factors partially offset the perceived beneficial effects of N addition on SOC storage in tropical forest soils.
