Recently, it has become essential to use design methodologies including computer simulations for diesel engines that have small amounts of NOx and SOOT while maintaining reasonable fuel economy. For this purpose, multi-objective optimization techniques should be used. Multi-objective optimization problems have several types of objectives and they should be minimized or maximized at the same time. There is often a trade-off relationship between objects and derivation of the Pareto optimum solutions that express the relationship between the objects is one of the goals in this case. The proposed system consists of a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and phenomenological model. MOGA has strong search capability for Pareto optimum solutions. However, MOGA requires a large number of iterations. Therefore, for MOGA, a diesel combustion simulator that can express combustion precisely with small calculation cost is essential. Phenomenological models can simulate diesel engine combustions precisely with small calculation cost. Therefore, phenomenological models are suitable for MOGA. In the optimization simulations, fuel injection shape, boost pressure, EGR rate, start angle of injection, duration angle of injection, and swirl ration were chosen as design variables. The values of these design variables were optimized to reduce SFC, NOx, and SOOT. Through the optimization simulations, the following five points were made clarified. First, the proposed system can find the Pareto optimum solutions successfully. Second, MOGAs are very effective to derive the solutions. Third, phenomenological models are very suitable for MOGAs, as they can perform precise simulations with small calculation cost. Fourth, multi-pulse injection shape can affect the amounts of SFC, NOx, and SOOT.

Research conducted by the authors showed that public transport, apart from the obvious effect of decreased number of private vehicles and decreased congestion, can contribute to reduced air pollutant emissions and become a significant driver for the implementation of electromobility in cities. However, the achievement of this goal depends on taking appropriate actions not only in the transport branch but also in other sectors of economy.

Annual reductions range from 3.0% to 3.8%, with the greatest reductions coming in PM10 nonattainment areas, but with very significant reductions also in PM10 attainment areas, ozone attainment areas, and rural areas. The widespread reductions appear to be due to a set of controls or common factors that are having a fairly uniform effect in all of the areas.

The main goal of these reports is to provide Congress and the public with comprehensive, up-to-date, peer-reviewed information on the Clean Air Act\u2019s social benefits and costs, including improvements in human health, welfare, and ecological resources, as well as the impact of the Act\u2019s provisions on the US economy. This report is the third in the Section 812 series, and is the result of EPA\u2019s Second Prospective analysis of the 1990 Amendments. The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 augmented the significant progress made in improving the nation's air quality through the original Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1977 amendments. The amendments built off the existing structure of the original Clean Air Act, but went beyond those requirements to tighten and clarify implementation goals and timing, increase the stringency of some federal requirements, revamp the hazardous air pollutant regulatory program, refine and streamline permitting requirements, and introduce new programs for the control of acid rain and stratospheric ozone depleters. The main purpose of this report is to document the costs and benefits of the 1990 CAAA provisions incremental to those costs and benefits achieved from implementing the original 1970 Clean Air Act and the 1977 amendments. The analysis estimates the costs and benefits of reducing emissions of air pollutants by comparing a \"with-CAAA\" scenario that reflects expected or likely future measures implemented under the CAAA with a \u201cwithout-CAAA\u201d scenario that freezes the scope and stringency of emissions controls at the levels that existed prior to implementing the CAAA. There are six basic steps undertaken to complete this analysis: 1. air pollutant emissions modeling; 2. compliance cost estimation; 3. ambient air quality modeling; 4. health and environmental effects estimation; 5. economic valuation of these effects; and 6. results aggregation and uncertainty characterization. The results of our analysis, summarized in the table below, make it abundantly clear that the benefits of the CAAA exceed its costs by a wide margin, making the CAAA a very good investment for the nation. We estimate that the annual dollar value of benefits of air quality improvements will be very large, and will grow over time as emissions control programs take their full effect, reaching a level of approximately $2.0 trillion in 2020. These benefits will be achieved as a result of CAAA-related programs and regulatory compliance actions estimated to cost approximately $65 billion in 2020. Most of these benefits (about 85 percent) are attributable to reductions in premature mortality associated with reductions in ambient particulate matter; as a result, we estimate that cleaner air will, by 2020, prevent 230,000 cases of premature mortality in that year. The The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act fron 1990 to 2020 remaining benefits are roughly equally divided among three categories of human health and environmental improvement: preventing premature mortality associated with ozone exposure; preventing morbidity, including acute myocardial infarctions and chronic bronchitis; and improving the quality of ecological resources and other aspects of the environment, the largest component of which is improved visibility. The very wide margin between estimated benefits and costs, and the results of our uncertainty analysis, suggest that it is extremely unlikely that the monetized benefits of the CAAA over the 1990 to 2020 period reasonably could be less than its costs, under any alternative set of assumptions we can conceive. Our central benefits estimate exceeds costs by a factor of more than 30 to one, and the high benefits estimate exceeds costs by 90 times. Even the low benefits estimate exceeds costs by about three to one.

A review", "abstract": "The Earth\u2019s climate is rapidly changing largely due to increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural practices during crop production, food processing, and product marketing all generate GHG, contributing to the global climate change. The general public and farmers are urging the development and adoption of effective measures to reduce GHG emissions from all agricultural activities and sectors. However, quantitative information is not available in regard to what strategies and practices should be adopted to reduce emission from agriculture and how crop productivity would affect the intensity of GHG emission. To provide the potential solution, we estimated the carbon footprint [i.e., the total amount of GHG associated with the production and distribution of a given food product expressed in carbon dioxide equivalence (CO2e)] for some of the major field crops grown on the Canadian prairie and assessed the effect of crop sequences on the carbon footprint of durum wheat. Key strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of various field crops grown in semiarid areas were identified. Carbon footprints were estimated using emissions from (1) the decomposition of crop straw and roots; (2) the manufacture of N and P fertilizers and their rates of application; (3) the production of herbicides and fungicides; and (4) miscellaneous farm field operations. Production and application of N fertilizers accounted for 57% to 65% of the total footprint, those from crop residue decomposition 16% to 30%, and the remaining portion of the footprint included CO2e from the production of P fertilizer and pesticides, and from miscellaneous field operations. Crops grown in the Brown soil zone had the lowest carbon footprint, averaging 0.46\u00a0kg CO2e kg\u22121 of grain, whereas crops grown in the Black soil zone had a larger average carbon footprint of 0.83\u00a0kg CO2e kg\u22121 of grain. The average carbon footprint for crops grown in the Dark Brown soil zone was intermediate to the other two at 0.61\u00a0kg CO2e kg\u22121 of grain. One kilogram of grain product emitted 0.80\u00a0kg CO2e for canola (Brassica napus L.), 0.59 for mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), 0.46 for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and 0.20 to 0.33\u00a0kg CO2e for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.). Durum wheat (T. aestivum L.) preceded by an N-fixing crop (i.e., pulses) emitted total greenhouse gases of 673\u00a0kg CO2e, 20% lower than when the crop was preceded by a cereal crop. Similarly, durum wheat preceded by an oilseed emitted 744\u00a0kg CO2e, 11% lower than when preceded by a cereal. The carbon footprint for durum grown after a pulse was 0.25\u00a0kg CO2e per kg of the grain and 0.28\u00a0kg CO2e per kg of the grain when grown after an oilseed: a reduction in the carbon footprint of 24% to 32% than when grown after a cereal. The average carbon footprint can be lowered by as much as 24% for crops grown in the Black, 28% in the Dark Brown, and 37% in the Brown soil zones, through improved agronomic practices, increased N use efficiency, use of diversified cropping systems, adoption of crop cultivars with high harvest index, and the use of soil bioresources such as P-solublizers and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in crop production.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "583735b15ef46b432f488d4f925c229403c40726", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087770862", "DOI": "10.1109/50.4013", "CorpusId": 110456338}, "title": "Electrical feedback and its network analysis for linewidth reduction of a semiconductor laser", "abstract": "The center frequency of the field spectrum of a 1.5- mu m InGaAsP distributed-feedback laser was stabilized by negative electrical feedback.

However, the energy yield from agronomic crops varies due to local climate, weather and soil variability. A variation in the yield of raw material used (feedstock) could also cause variability in GHG reductions if biofuels are used. The goal of the present study was to determine the net reduction of GHG emissions if ethanol from wheat produced in different regions of the south-eastern USA is used as an alternative to gasoline from fossil fuel sources. Two scenarios were investigated; the first included ethanol produced from grain only, and the second included ethanol produced from both grain and wheat straw. Winter wheat yield was simulated with the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Wheat model for climate, soil and crop management representing six counties in the following USA states: Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Ethanol production was determined from the simulated grain and straw yields together with fixed grain and straw yield ethanol ratios. Subsequently, net reductions in GHG emissions were determined by accounting for the emissions from the replaced gasoline, and by animal feed and electricity that were replaced by ethanol processing co-products. Greenhouse gases that were emitted in the ethanol production chain were also taken into account. Across all locations, the reduction in GHG emissions was 187 g CO2-equivalents/km in the grain-only scenario and 208 g CO2-equivalents/km in the grain and straw scenario. The reductions in GHG emissions varied significantly between locations and growing seasons within the two scenarios. Similar approaches could be applied to assess the environmental impact of GHG emissions from other biofuels.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "d04158ba036014d76452cae81d2831e509f7eadd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2758706275", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-50079-9_19", "CorpusId": 169008860}, "title": "Resource Efficiency in the Building Sector", "abstract": "Endeavours towards resource-efficient and climate friendly construction seem to be reaching their limits.

A significant impact in the reduction of GHG emissions from agriculture can be achieved if methane emissions from ricefields can be abated. This study presents the contribution of Philippine rice cultivation to global methane emission and breakthroughs in methane emission studies in the country which address the issue of mitigation. Using the derived emission factors from local measurements, rice cultivation contributes 566.6 Gg of methane emission in the Philippines. This value is 62% of the total methane emitted from the agriculture sector. The emission factors employed which are 78% of the IPCC value for irrigated rice and 95% for rainfed rice were derived from measurements with an automatic system taken during the growth duration in the respective ecosystems. Plots drained for 2 weeks at midtillering and before harvest gave a significant reduction in methane emission as opposed to continuously flooded plots and plots drained before harvest. The cultivar Magat reduced methane emission by 50% as compared to the check variety IR72. The application of ammonium sulfate instead of urea reduced methane emission by 10% to more\u00a0\u00bb 34%. Addition of 6 t ha{sup {minus}1} phosphogypsum in combination with urea reduced emission by 74% as opposed to plots applied with urea alone.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that these decrements appear before the onset of memory deficits or other symptoms in persons at genetic risk for AD. This study compares in vivo imaging results and in situ postmortem analyses by examining the posterior cingulate (area 23) in 15 AD patients and 13 age-matched nondemented controls using quantitative cytochrome oxidase histochemistry as an intracellular measure of oxidative energy metabolic capacity. Each of the six layers of the posterior cingulate demonstrated a decline in cytochrome oxidase activity in AD relative to controls, whereas adjacent motor cortex showed no significant differences. This decrement did not appear to be mainly secondary to nonspecific decrement in mitochondrial enzymes, oxidative stress, cell loss, or histopathology. The cytochrome oxidase decrement was most severe in the superficial layer I (\u221239%), which demonstrated a correlation to disease duration. Covariance analyses suggest that superficial laminas undergo a functional uncoupling from the deeper layers of posterior cingulate cortex in AD, whereas no such effects are found in motor cortex or controls. These findings expand on previous results from PET studies by illuminating the layer-specific cytochrome oxidase contributions to energy hypometabolism.

We\nused the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005\u20132013 from one of our previous\nstudies.

Results show that the Energy Conservation and\nEmissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and\nfocused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5\nreductions.

Estimating carbon exchange at regional scales is paramount to understanding feedbacks between climate and the carbon cycle, but also to verifying climate change mitigation such as emission reductions and strategies compensating for emissions such as carbon sequestration. This paper discusses evidence for a number of important shortcomings of current generation modelling frameworks designed to provide regional scale budgets from atmospheric observations. Current top-down and bottom-up approaches targeted at deriving consistent regional scale carbon exchange estimates for biospheric and anthropogenic sources and sinks are hampered by a number of issues: we show that top-down constraints using point measurements made from tall towers, although sensitive to larger spatial scales, are however influenced by local areas much more strongly than previously thought. On the other hand, classical bottom-up approaches using process information collected at the local scale, such as from eddy covariance data, need up-scaling and validation on larger scales. We therefore argue for a combination of both approaches, implicitly providing the important local scale information for the top-down constraint, and providing the atmospheric constraint for up-scaling of flux measurements. Combining these data streams necessitates quantifying their respective representation errors, which are discussed. The impact of these findings on future network design is highlighted, and some recommendations are given.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "b6940ef9a423f22a3e755460fdfba329dd5276c8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2919733532", "DOI": "10.1111/1468-2427.12740", "CorpusId": 150977631}, "title": "Contradictions of the Climate\u2010Friendly City: New Perspectives on Eco\u2010Gentrification and Housing Justice", "abstract": "Abstract As local governments and corporations promote ?climate friendliness?, and a low-carbon lifestyle becomes increasingly desirable, more middle- and upper-income urban residents are choosing to live near public transit, on bike- and pedestrian-friendly streets, and in higher-density mixed-use areas. This rejection of classical forms of suburbanization has, in part, increased property values in neighborhoods offering these amenities, displacing lower-income, often non-white, residents. Increased prevalence of creative and technology workers appears to accelerate this trend. We argue that a significant and understudied socio-environmental contradiction also occurs where the actual environmental outcomes of neighborhood transformation may not be what we expect. New research on greenhouse gas emissions shows that more affluent residents have much larger carbon footprints because of their consumption, even when reductions in transportation or building energy emissions are included. We describe an area in Seattle, Washington, the location of Amazon's headquarters, experiencing this contradiction and show a distinct convergence of city investments in low-carbon infrastructure, significant rises in housing prices and decreases in lower-income and non-white residents.

The aim of this study was to quantify the genetic variation of methane emission by Dutch Holstein Friesian cows measured using infrared sensors installed in automatic milking systems (AMS). Measurements of CH4 and CO2 on 1,508 Dutch Holstein Friesian cows located on 11 commercial dairy farms were available. Phenotypes per AMS visit were the mean of CH4, mean of CO2, mean of CH4 divided by mean of CO2, and their log10-transformations. The repeatabilities of the log10-transformated methane phenotypes were 0.27 for CH4, 0.31 for CO2, and 0.14 for the ratio. The log10-transformated heritabilities of these phenotypes were 0.11 for CH4, 0.12 for CO2, and 0.03 for the ratio. These results indicate that measurements taken using infrared sensors in AMS are repeatable and heritable and, thus, could be used for selection for lower CH4 emission. Furthermore, it is important to account for farm, AMS, day of measurement, time of day, and lactation stage when estimating genetic parameters for methane phenotypes.

Black carbon (BC), a distinct type of carbonaceous material formed from the incomplete combustion of fossil and biomass based fuels under certain conditions, can interact with solar radiation and clouds through its strong light-absorption ability, thereby warming the Earth's climate system. Some studies have even suggested that global warming could be slowed down in the short term by eliminating BC emission due to its short lifetime. In this study, we estimate the influence of removing some sources of BC and other co-emitted species on the aerosol radiative effect by using an aerosol\u2013climate atmosphere-only model BCC_AGCM2.0.1_CUACE/Aero with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice cover, in combination with the aerosol emissions from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. We find that the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) will be enhanced by 0.12 W m\u22122 compared with recent past year 2000 levels if the emissions of only BC are reduced to the level projected for 2100 based on the RCP2.6 scenario. This will be beneficial~for the mitigation of global warming. However, both aerosol negative direct and indirect radiative effects are weakened when BC and its co-emitted species (sulfur dioxide and organic carbon) are simultaneously reduced. Relative to year 2000 levels, the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the TOA will be weakened by 1.7\u20132.0 W m\u22122 if the emissions of all these aerosols are decreased to the levels projected for 2100 in different ways based on the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios.

In this paper, a multi-objective multi-stage approach is proposed to optimize building energy design by addressing the aforementioned public and private aims. The first stage implements a genetic algorithm by coupling MATLAB\u00ae and EnergyPlus pursuing the minimization of energy demands for space conditioning and of discomfort hours.

Furthermore, the impact of such solutions on heat emissions into the external environment is investigated because these emissions highly affect urban overheating, external human comfort and the livability of our cities. The main novelty of this approach is the possibility to properly conjugate the public perspective (minimization of GHG emissions) and the private one (minimization of global costs). The focus on the reduction of heat emissions, in addition to the assessment of energy demands and GHG emissions, is novel too for investigations concerning building energy efficiency.

The main components of these fine particles are ammonium sulfate or ammonium bisulfate. There is a good correlation between the formation of fine particles and the SO2 oxidation rate.

The surface loading dependence was attributed to the creation of intense electric fields around the network of Ag nanowires and to the coupling of fluorophore excited states that takes place efficiently at a distance of 10 nm from the surface of nanowires, which was confirmed by theoretical calculations.

The aim of this study was to explore the sites of metabolic changes with [18F]2-fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and to correlate the findings with clinical symptoms.

The clinical data of the patients, based on a standardized evaluation by physicians from the German Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance study, was correlated with the PET findings. [18F]FDG-PET shows widespread hypometabolism in CJD. All patients had a reduction of cerebral glucose metabolism in at least one temporal or parietal region. Additionally in 7 of our own 8 cases and 3 of 4 cases from the literature the occipital lobe, the cerebellum or the basal ganglia were involved. These findings differ from typical patterns of hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. In two thirds of the cases the distribution was markedly asymmetric. Myoclonus was present in five out of our eight own cases. Our data suggest that myoclonus might correlate with metabolic impairment of contralateral parietal and temporal lobes. In three of four patients with visual symptoms FDG uptake was reduced in the visual cortex bilaterally.

The global aerosol\u2013climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ was used to investigate changes in the aerosol burden and aerosol radiative effects in the coming decades. Four different emissions scenarios were applied for 2030 (two of them applied also for 2020) and the results were compared against the reference year 2005. Two of the scenarios are based on current legislation reductions: one shows the maximum potential of reductions that can be achieved by technical measures, and the other is targeted to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). We have analyzed the results in terms of global means and additionally focused on eight subregions. Based on our results, aerosol burdens show an overall decreasing trend as they basically follow the changes in primary and precursor emissions. However, in some locations, such as India, the burdens could increase significantly. The declining emissions have an impact on the clear-sky direct aerosol effect (DRE), i.e. the cooling effect. The DRE could decrease globally 0.06\u20130.4 W m\u22122 by 2030 with some regional increases, for example, over India (up to 0.84 W m\u22122). The global changes in the DRE depend on the scenario and are smallest in the targeted SLCF simulation. The aerosol indirect radiative effect could decline 0.25\u20130.82 W m\u22122 by 2030. This decrease takes place mostly over the oceans, whereas the DRE changes are greatest over the continents.

At 2644 km2, the zone encompasses most of Greater London. It restricts the entry of the oldest and most polluting diesel vehicles, including heavy-goods vehicles (haulage trucks), buses and coaches, larger vans, and minibuses. It does not apply to cars or motorcycles. The LEZ scheme will introduce increasingly stringent Euro emissions standards over time. The creation of this zone presented a unique opportunity to estimate the effects of a stepwise reduction in vehicle emissions on air quality and health. Before undertaking such an investigation, robust baseline data were gathered on air quality and the oxidative activity and metal content of particulate matter (PM) from air pollution monitors located in Greater London. In addition, methods were developed for using databases of electronic primary-care records in order to evaluate the zone's health effects. Our study began in 2007, using information about the planned restrictions in an agreed-upon LEZ scenario and year-on-year changes in the vehicle fleet in models to predict air pollution concentrations in London for the years 2005, 2008, and 2010. Based on this detailed emissions and air pollution modeling, the areas in London were then identified that were expected to show the greatest changes in air pollution concentrations and population exposures after the implementation of the LEZ. Using these predictions, the best placement of a pollution monitoring network was determined and the feasibility of evaluating the health effects using electronic primary-care records was assessed. To measure baseline pollutant concentrations before the implementation of the LEZ, a comprehensive monitoring network was established close to major roadways and intersections. Output-difference plots from statistical modeling for 2010 indicated seven key areas likely to experience the greatest change in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (at least 3 microg/m3) and of PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) (at least 0.75 microg/m3) as a result of the LEZ; these suggested that the clearest signals of change were most likely to be measured near roadsides. The seven key areas were also likely to be of importance in carrying out a study to assess the health outcomes of an air quality intervention like the LEZ. Of the seven key areas, two already had monitoring sites with a full complement of equipment, four had monitoring sites that required upgrades of existing equipment, and one required a completely new installation. With the upgrades and new installations in place, fully ratified (verified) pollutant data (for PM10, PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm [PM2.5], nitrogen oxides [NOx], and ozone [O3] at all sites as well as for particle number, black smoke [BS], carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2] at selected sites) were then collected for analysis. In addition, the seven key monitoring sites were supported by other sites in the London Air Quality Network (LAQN). From these, a robust set of baseline air quality data was produced. Data from automatic and manual traffic counters as well as automatic license-plate recognition cameras were used to compile detailed vehicle profiles. This enabled us to establish more precise associations between ambient pollutant concentrations and vehicle emissions. An additional goal of the study was to collect baseline PM data in order to test the hypothesis that changes in traffic densities and vehicle mixes caused by the LEZ would affect the oxidative potential and metal content of ambient PM10 and PM2.5. The resulting baseline PM data set was the first to describe, in detail, the oxidative potential and metal content of the PM10 and PM2.5 of a major city's airshed. PM in London has considerable oxidative potential; clear differences in this measure were found from site to site, with evidence that the oxidative potential of both PM10 and PM2.5 at roadside monitoring sites was higher than at urban background locations. In the PM10 samples this increased oxidative activity appeared to be associated with increased concentrations of copper (Cu), barium (Ba), and bathophenanthroline disulfonate-mobilized iron (BPS Fe) in the roadside samples. In the PM2.5 samples, no simple association could be seen, suggesting that other unmeasured components were driving the increased oxidative potential in this fraction of the roadside samples. These data suggest that two components were contributing to the oxidative potential of roadside PM, namely Cu and BPS Fe in the coarse fraction of PM (PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microm to 10 microm; PM(2.5-10)) and an unidentified redox catalyst in PM2.5. The data derived for this baseline study confirmed key observations from a more limited spatial mapping exercise published in our earlier HEI report on the introduction of the London's Congestion Charging Scheme (CCS) in 2003 (Kelly et al. 2011a,b). In addition, the data set in the current report provided robust baseline information on the oxidative potential and metal content of PM found in the London airshed in the period before implementation of the LEZ; the finding that a proportion of the oxidative potential appears in the PM coarse mode and is apparently related to brake wear raises important issues regarding the nature of traffic management schemes. The final goal of this baseline study was to establish the feasibility, in ethical and operational terms, of using the U.K.'s electronic primary-care records to evaluate the effects of the LEZ on human health outcomes. Data on consultations and prescriptions were compiled from a pilot group of general practices (13 distributed across London, with 100,000 patients; 29 situated in the inner London Borough of Lambeth, with 200,000 patients). Ethics approvals were obtained to link individual primary-care records to modeled NOx concentrations by means of post-codes. (To preserve anonymity, the postcodes were removed before delivery to the research team.) A wide range of NOx exposures was found across London as well as within and between the practices examined. Although we observed little association between NOx exposure and smoking status, a positive relationship was found between exposure and increased socioeconomic deprivation. The health outcomes we chose to study were asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wheeze, hay fever, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These outcomes were measured as prevalence or incidence. Their distributions by age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity, and smoking were found to accord with those reported in the epidemiology literature. No cross-sectional positive associations were found between exposure to NOx and any of the studied health outcomes; some associations were significantly negative. After the pilot study, a suitable primary-care database of London patients was identified, the General Practice Research Database responsible for giving us access to these data agreed to collaborate in the evaluation of the LEZ, and an acceptable method of ensuring privacy of the records was agreed upon. The database included about 350,000 patients who had remained at the same address over the four-year period of the study. Power calculations for a controlled longitudinal analysis were then performed, indicating that for outcomes such as consultations for respiratory illnesses or prescriptions for asthma there was sufficient power to identify a 5% to 10% reduction in consultations for patients most exposed to the intervention compared with patients presumed to not be exposed to it. In conclusion, the work undertaken in this study provides a good foundation for future LEZ evaluations. Our extensive monitoring network, measuring a comprehensive set of pollutants (and a range of particle metrics), will continue to provide a valuable tool both for assessing the impact of LEZ regulations on air quality in London and for furthering understanding of the link between PM's composition and toxicity. Finally, we believe that in combination with our modeling of the predicted population-based changes in pollution exposure in London, the use of primary-care databases forms a sound basis and has sufficient statistical power for the evaluation of the potential impact of the LEZ on human health.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "33aa671efeac76df44bba93959b31b08704efca2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017697220", "DBLP": "conf/cec/WuCWW08", "DOI": "10.1109/CEC.2008.4631183", "CorpusId": 23969993}, "title": "Application of Particle Swarm Optimization for component sizes in parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicles", "abstract": "This paper describes an approach for the optimization of parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) component sizing using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

The WARM GHG emission factors are used to compare the net emissions associated with PCs in the following four materials management alternatives: source reduction, recycling, landfilling, and combustion. For background information on the general purpose and function of WARM emission factors, see the Introduction & Overview chapter. For more information on Source Reduction, Recycling, Landfilling, and Combustion, see the chapters devoted to those processes. WARM also allows users to calculate results in terms of energy, rather than GHGs. The energy results are calculated using the same methodology described here but with slight adjustments, as explained in the Energy Impacts chapter. The main components of a PC are the central processing units (CPU) and the monitor. The PC modeled in WARM is based on a typical desktop PC with a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. The CPU consists of housing (mostly steel) and internal electronic components, while the monitor's primary components are the CRT, plastic case and circuit boards. The wide range of PC models makes it difficult to specify the exact composition of a typical PC, and PC technology continues to evolve rapidly. For WARM analysis, EPA considers the CPU and CRT monitor, while the peripheral equipment (e.g., keyboards, external cables, printers) are left out of the analysis. Flat-panel monitors are now dominant in today's market, having displaced CRT monitors that were common in the 1990's and early 2000's. Although flat-panel monitors are beginning to enter the MSW stream in larger quantities, CRT monitors are still present and will likely remain a sizable component of end-of-life electronics for a number of years. Upon disposal, PCs can be recovered for recycling, sent to a landfill or combusted. Exhibit 1 shows the general outline of materials management pathways in WARM. Recycling PCs is an open-loop process, meaning that components are recycled into secondary materials such as asphalt, steel sheet, lead bullion, CRT glass, copper wire and aluminum sheet. PCs are collected curbside and at special events, or individuals can bring them to designated drop-off sites. Once PCs have been collected for recycling, they are sent to Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) that specialize in separating and recovering materials from electronic products.

CH3Hg+ are ingested by fish and subsequently bioaccumulated in their tissue and, eventually, enter the human diet, causing serious health issues. Therefore, selective and sensitive detection of bioaccumulated CH3Hg+ in fish samples is essential. Herein, the development of a simple, highly sensitive and selective aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based turn-on probe for both inorganic mercury ions and organicmercury species is reported. The probe's function is based on mercury ion-promoted transmetalation reaction of aryl boronic acid. The probe, a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-monoboronic acid (1), was successfully utilized for AIE-based fluorescence imaging study on methylmercury-contaminated live cells and zebrafish for the first time. Both Hg(II) and CH3Hg+ ensued a fast transmetalation of TPE-boronic acid causing drastic reduction in the solubility of the resulting product (TPE-HgCl/TPE-HgMe) in the working solvent system. At the dispersed phase, the aggregated form of TPE-mercury ions recovers planarity because of restricted rotational freedom promoting aggregation-induced emission.

The emergence of new technologies for the production of fuels and chemicals from butanol will allow it to be a significant component of a necessarily dynamic and multifaceted solution to the current global energy crisis. \n \n \n \nIMPACT: The production of butanol from biomass and its utilization as a precursor to a diverse set of fuel products has the potential to reduce petroleum use worldwide. In concert with other emerging renewable technologies, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may be realized. The rapid incorporation of renewables into the world fuel supply may also help to offset predicted increases in transportation fuel prices as the supply of oil declines. \n \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS: Recent work has shown that butanol is a potential gasoline replacement that can also be blended in significant quantities with conventional diesel fuel. These efforts have transitioned to research focused on the development of viable methods for the production of an array of oxygenated and fully saturated jet and diesel fuels from butanol.

A two-layer transient groundwater flow model of the aquifer system was calibrated and validated for the period 1980\u20131995 and provided the historic flow record for the climate change simulations. Two future scenarios were selected from the Hadley Centre\u2019s climate change experiments using HadCM2: (1) a medium-high (MH) emissions scenario; and (2) a medium-low (ML) emissions scenario of \u2018greenhouse\u2019 gases. Two future periods were considered: 2020\u20132035 and 2050\u20132065. Future recharge to the aquifer was estimated by adjusting the historic record of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration by factors calculated from comparing control and future HadCM2-generated values. Impacts of climate change were evaluated by incorporating the monthly estimated recharge inputs within the flow model. The most noticeable and consistent result of the climate change impact simulations is the decrease in recharge expected in autumn for all scenarios (decreases ranging from 17 to 35%) as a consequence of the smaller amount of summer precipitation and increased autumn potential evapotranspiration. For the 2050MH scenario, these conditions lead to a 42 0ncrease in autumn soil moisture deficit and a 26% reduction in recharge. Hence, west Norfolk can expect longer and drier summers that are predicted to have relatively little effect on summer groundwater levels (generally a 1 to 2 0ecrease) but will result in a decrease of up to 14 0n autumn river baseflow volumes.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "7644affde268ebf510b7a98de7e8cef8c3379870", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972538122", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201001738", "CorpusId": 205591351, "PubMed": "20799302"}, "title": "Formation of surface traps on quantum dots by bidentate chelation and their application in low-potential electrochemiluminescent biosensing.", "abstract": "Bidentate chelation, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), was used as a stabilizer for the synthesis of CdTe quantum dots (QDs).

A severe reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The implementation and continuous evaluation of mitigation measures requires regular independent information on emissions of the two main anthropogenic greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Our aim is to employ an observation-based method to determine regional-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates with high accuracy. We use aircraft- and ground-based in situ observations of CH4, CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and wind speed from two research flights over the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), Poland, in summer 2018. The flights were performed as a part of the Carbon Dioxide and Methane (CoMet) mission above this European CH4 emission hot spot region. A kriging algorithm interpolates the observed concentrations between the downwind transects of the trace gas plume and then the mass flux through this plane is calculated. Finally, statistic and systematic uncertainties are calculated from measurement uncertainties and through several sensitivity tests, respectively. For the two selected flights, the in situ derived annual CH4 emission estimates are 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6\u2009kg/s and 15.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0\u2009kg/s, which is well within the range of emission inventories.

These errors mainly result from the uncertainty of atmospheric background mole fractions and the changing planetary boundary layer height during the morning flight.

An energy economic model estimating the optimal emissions path for greenhouse gases and an impact assessment model estimating the impacts of global warming in various fields caused by climate changes under this optimal emissions path were used in our assessment. In contrast to the business-as-usual case, our results showed that in order to maintain greenhouse gas concentrations at less than 500ppm (by volume), reduction volumes must be 3,0GtCeq/year by 2020 and 12.2 GtCeq/year by 2050, indicating an urgent need for a full-scale reduction system.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "2139ee8252d9b614f4766d129426d6eb5c07dce3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2157913554", "DOI": "10.1021/es300666e", "CorpusId": 39457531, "PubMed": "22769063"}, "title": "Bayesian analysis of a reduced-form air quality model.", "abstract": "Numerical air quality models are being used for assessing emission control strategies for improving ambient pollution levels across the globe. This paper applies probabilistic modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of emission reduction scenarios aimed at lowering ground-level ozone concentrations. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to combine air quality model output and monitoring data in order to characterize the impact of emissions reductions while accounting for different degrees of uncertainty in the modeled emissions inputs. The probabilistic model predictions are weighted based on population density in order to better quantify the societal benefits/disbenefits of four hypothetical emission reduction scenarios in which domain-wide NO(x) emissions from various sectors are reduced individually and then simultaneously. Cross validation analysis shows the statistical model performs well compared to observed ozone levels. Accounting for the variability and uncertainty in the emissions and atmospheric systems being modeled is shown to impact how emission reduction scenarios would be ranked, compared to standard methodology.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a2babcd9fd589951033e3938b2b0d6e80028ad64", "externalIds": {"MAG": "169564848", "DOI": "10.6027/NA2015-905", "CorpusId": 150833711}, "title": "Fossil-Fuel Subsidies and Climate Change : Options for policy-makers within their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions", "abstract": "Every year governments spend $543 billion subsidising fossil-fuels.
