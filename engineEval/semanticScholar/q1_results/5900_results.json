Therefore, it is important to investigate ways that poultry facilities can coexist in close proximity to residential areas without odors and environmental challenges. Ammonia (NH3) is the greatest concern for environmental pollution from poultry production. When birds consume protein, they produce uric acid, ultimately converted to NH3 under favorable conditions. Factors that increase production include pH, temperature, moisture content, litter type, bird age, manure age, relative humidity, and ventilation rate (VR). NH3 concentration and emissions in poultry houses depend on VR; seasons also have effects on NH3 production. Modern ventilation systems can minimize NH3 in enclosed production spaces quickly but increase its emissions to the environment. NH3 adversely affects the ecosystem, environment, and health of birds and people. Less than 10\u00a0ppm is the ideal limit for exposure, but up to 25\u00a0ppm is also not harmful. NH3 can be minimized by housing type, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, manure handling practices, litter amendment, and diet manipulation without affecting performance and production. Antibiotics can minimize NH3, but consumers have concerns about health effects. Administration of probiotics seems to be a useful replacement for antibiotics.

The synthesis of cerium hexaboride (and most other borides) normally requires very high temperatures (1500 \u00b0C\u20131700 \u00b0C) and high pressures. Thus, the low temperature synthesis of cerium hexaboride at ambient pressure is a challenge. The present study highlights the synthesis of vertically aligned cerium hexaboride nanorods which offer better field emission properties with the highest field enhancement factor reported so far. The optimization of the process for obtaining vertically aligned cerium hexaboride nanorods involves three different stages. First, the low temperature synthesis of polycrystalline cerium hexaboride; second, the fabrication of cerium hexaboride films having vertically oriented nanorods (by spin coating and slow evaporation) and third, the enhancement of the field emission properties. The synthesis of cerium hexaboride nanorods has been carried out by a low temperature borothermal reduction process using a cerium precursor (synthesized via a reverse micellar route and a hydrothermal route) and boron as the starting materials. The borothermal reduction of the cerium precursors has been carried out at low temperature (\u223c1300 \u00b0C) and ambient pressure in an inert atmosphere.

Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments.MethodsFive European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys.ResultsThere are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied.ConclusionsThe climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions.

Indeed, no therapeutics are currently approved for the treatment of anhedonia. Notably, over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience significant levels of anhedonia during a depressive episode. Recent research into novel and rapid-acting therapeutics for depression, particularly the noncompetitive N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, has highlighted the role of the glutamatergic system in the treatment of depression; however, it is unknown whether ketamine specifically improves anhedonic symptoms. The present study used a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design to examine whether a single ketamine infusion could reduce anhedonia levels in 36 patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The study also used positron emission tomography imaging in a subset of patients to explore the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning ketamine\u2019s anti-anhedonic effects. We found that ketamine rapidly reduced the levels of anhedonia. Furthermore, this reduction occurred independently from reductions in general depressive symptoms.

In the center and north, where there are extensive areas of indigenous land ownership and pastoral production is less intensive, savanna burning is frequent. Greenhouse gas emissions from rangelands have been overwhelmingly from land clearing and methane production by livestock. Reductions in the rate of land clearing have substantially reduced Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, but these have been controversial with the reduced potential pasture production being of concern to many land managers. Reductions in direct livestock emissions are possible through manipulation of the genetics, rumen flora, or diet of animals. However, the greatest potential benefit is a whole-property approach with improved animal husbandry and attention to other aspects of property management such as fossil fuel consumption. Focus on emissions per unit of land area is likely to have other ecological benefits for land condition and to capture the effects of changes in carbon stocks in vegetation and soils. In much of northern and central Australia, changes in settlement patterns have led to more frequent and intense fires than under indigenous management regimes before European settlement. The implementation of more benign regimes of savanna burning has great potential benefit for greenhouse abatement, biodiversity, and livelihoods of indigenous people in remote settlements.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "930781b98d668de776c3889d4c55b3380548ff5c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2405472832", "CorpusId": 17418366}, "title": "Visible Light Communication: Opportunities, Challenges and Channel Models", "abstract": "Recent advancements in Solid State Lighting (SSL) have triggered research in the domain of Visible Light Communication (VLC) which enables us to use Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for illumination as well as low cost, high speed, power efficient and secure data communication.

This sequence forms the basis for a biofuel production process that is currently being examined for its commercial potential. In this paper, we calculate the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions for three different system scenarios for this proposed ethanol production process, using process simulations and thermodynamic calculations. The energy required for ethanol separation increases rapidly for low initial concentrations of ethanol, and, unlike other biofuel systems, there is little waste biomass available to provide process heat and electricity to offset those energy requirements. The ethanol purification process is a major consumer of energy and a significant contributor to the carbon footprint. With a lead scenario based on a natural-gas-fueled combined heat and power system to provide process electricity and extra heat and conservative assumptions around the ethanol separation process, the net life cycle energy consumption, excluding photosynthesis, ranges from 0.55 MJ/MJ(EtOH) down to 0.20 MJ/ MJ(EtOH), and the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions range from 29.8 g CO\u2082e/MJ(EtOH) down to 12.3 g CO\u2082e/MJ(EtOH) for initial ethanol concentrations from 0.5 wt % to 5 wt %. In comparison to gasoline, these predicted values represent 67% and 87% reductions in the carbon footprint for this ethanol fuel on a energy equivalent basis.

In this first paper, we present the observations, color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and the SFHs of the 18 starburst galaxies, based on a homogeneous approach to the data reduction, differential extinction, and treatment of photometric completeness. We adopt a star formation rate (SFR) threshold normalized to the average SFR of the individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in SFHs derived from resolved stellar populations. This choice facilitates finding not only the currently bursting galaxies but also \"fossil\" bursts increasing the sample size of starburst galaxies in the nearby (D 100 Myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definition or identification method. The longer lived bursts rule out rapid \"self-quenching\" of starbursts on global scales. The bursting galaxies' gas consumption timescales are shorter than the Hubble time for all but one galaxy confirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations. Additionally, we find that the strength of the H\u03b1 emission usually correlates with the CMD-based SFR during the last 4-10 Myr. However, in four cases, the H\u03b1 emission is significantly less than what is expected for models of starbursts; the discrepancy is due to the SFR changing on timescales of a few Myr. The inherently short timescale of the H\u03b1 emission limits identifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics which may or may not be representative of the recent SFH of a galaxy.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "79ec869d4eadce9b5476eb6cc9390867bbfde823", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2018730322", "DOI": "10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000098", "CorpusId": 21008468}, "title": "Life-Cycle Analysis of Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Anaerobic Biodegradation of Municipal Solid Waste", "abstract": "Energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for current landfilling of municipal solid waste (MSW) was compared to potential biodegradation of MSW in anaerobic digesters (AD) throughout the United States. A hybrid life-cycle analysis was completed to assess the potential for anaerobic biodegradation of MSW to methane, a valuable energy source. Conversion of MSW to methane in AD would generate a form of renewable energy, reduce GHG emissions, and save landfill space for nonbiodegradable materials. Based on laboratory- and pilot-scale studies conducted in the United States, full-scale data from facilities in Europe, and economic input-output life-cycle analysis, the annual 127 million t of MSW landfilled in the United States could be biologically converted to 5.9 billion m 3 of methane. Net methane production would have an estimated value of $1.5 billion/year when converted to an equivalent amount of electricity at an assumed value of $0.1/kWh. The 15 billion kWh/year of renewable energy released through the biodegradation process is estimated to satisfy the annual consumption of 1.3 million United States households. The analysis also suggests that diversion of MSW from landfills to AD systems would result in GHG emissions reductions of 146 million t CO 2 e per year, due to decreased landfill activity and use of biogenic methane instead of fossil fuel for electricity production. This represents a reduction in total emissions of 1.9% compared to U.S. GHG emissions in 2006. Nationwide AD systems are projected to reduce cumulative energy consumption by nearly 15 million TJ and reduce GHG emissions by 7.2 billion t CO 2 e, over a 50-year period. Logistics and capital costs of developing a nationwide reactor-based system for MSW management are considerable. Development of appropriate national policy and incentives would be needed to stimulate such a transition from the current landfill-based system that currently exists. It is estimated that a carbon emissions credit on the order of $30 to $60/t CO 2 e would facilitate break-even economics for nationwide implementation of AD systems. Alternatively, renewable energy credits would enhance the value of electricity produced from AD biogas. Carbon emissions taxes on landfills would further improve the economics of AD systems.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "77c533ca7eb5932d59636a8b393f3c8f24bd2168", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2059777511", "DOI": "10.1021/JP910656G", "CorpusId": 97482984}, "title": "Nanotoxicity and Spectroscopy Studies of Silver Nanoparticle: Calf Thymus DNA and K562 as Targets", "abstract": "The interaction between silver nanoparticle and calf thymus DNA was studied by UV\u2212visible, fluorescence, and far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies at a physiologic temperature of 37 \u00b0C.

However, if it is assumed that ongoing technology development succeeds, emissions in 2020 may decrease by 5% from 2000 levels (a decrease of 10% compared to the case that assumes no new technology). This is a significant contribution to emission reduction. According to this model, a further emission reduction by 10% in 2020 is possible but costly as it requires emission reduction incentives of up to 10,000 yen per ton CO2 (approximately 100 US/ton). The use of biomass feed\u2010stocks, waste recycling, energy recovery from waste and gas\u2010based co\u2010generation are the main strategies for achieving this emission reduction.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "83d44c544f26de90e1a23593d2ee5df249dcc64a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977997384", "DOI": "10.1021/ES060504I", "CorpusId": 9843716, "PubMed": "17007115"}, "title": "Survey of catalysts for oxidation of mercury in flue gas.", "abstract": "Methods for removing mercury from flue gas have received increased attention because of recent limitations placed on mercury emissions from coal-fired utility boilers by the U.

A promising method for mercury removal is catalytic oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg0) to oxidized mercury (Hg2+), followed by wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD). FGD cannot remove Hg0, but easily removes Hg2+ because of its solubility in water. To date, research has focused on three broad catalyst areas: selective catalytic reduction catalysts, carbon-based materials, and metals and metal oxides. We review published results for each type of catalyst and also present a discussion on the possible reaction mechanisms in each case. One of the major sources of uncertainty in understanding catalytic mercury oxidation is a lack of knowledge of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics.

In contrast to the virtually photochromic character of the common spirobenzopyrans in most organic solvents, this spirobenzopyran is colorless in organic aqueous solution even irradiating by ultraviolet light. The formation of red merocyanine in an ethanol-aqueous solution is only induced by Cu2+ coordination. Furthermore, the closed form of the spirobenzopyran is highly fluorescent. Upon complexation with Cu2+, it displays not only decreasing in the initial fluorescence emission band but also appearing in a new emission at long wavelength. Thus, the Cu2+ quantitative measure can be achieved by fluorescence ratiometry. With the optimum conditions described, the Cu2+ concentration can be determined from 5.13 x 10(-7) M to 3.81 x 10(-4) with a detection limit of 1.06 x 10(-7) M. Both the color and the fluorescence changes of the spirobenzopyran are extremely specific for Cu2+ over biologically relevant substrates, which meet the selectivity requirements for biomedical application. Serum divalent copper values were determined using this spirobenzopyran, which fell into the normal range of the content reported in the literature and were in good agreement with those obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The combined data from fluorescence titrations and 1H NMR measurements indicate that the new emission of the spirobenzopyran generated by Cu2+ is the result of the metal-induced ring opening and conformation restriction by Cu2+ liganding with the opened merocyanine form and the subsequent reduction of the intramolecular charge transfer of the merocyanine.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "50c2fbaaa6046bdccc3707376f35204c3da8cde5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2078802046", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-013-0882-5", "CorpusId": 154450311}, "title": "Potential for forest carbon plantings to offset greenhouse emissions in Australia: economics and constraints to implementation", "abstract": "The theoretical potential for carbon forests to off-set greenhouse gas emissions may be high but the achievable rate is influenced by a range of economic and social factors.

We summed estimates of the carbon balance of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance during the 1990s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all European countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequestering carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon balance. Net terrestrial carbon balances were typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emissions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, however, of utmost importance to acknowledge that the typically small net carbon balance represents the small difference between two large but opposing fluxes: uptake by forests and grasslands and losses from arable lands and peatlands. This suggests that relatively small changes in either or both of these large component fluxes could induce large effects on the net total, indicating that mitigation schemes should not be discarded a priori. In the absence of carbon-oriented land management, the current net carbon uptake is bound to decline soon. Protecting it will require actions at three levels; a) maintaining the current sink activity of forests, b) altered agricultural management practices to reduce the emissions from arable soils or turn into carbon sinks and c) protecting current large reservoirs (wetlands and old forests), since carbon is lost more rapidly than sequestered.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "4d77e163c8681ee3ea8840cf1ed74f96cbc89c0a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2123001358", "CorpusId": 154457547}, "title": "Referentieramingen energie en emissies 2005 -2020", "abstract": "The Reference Projection 2005-2020 covers the future development of Dutch\nenergy use, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution up to 2020.

Five factors were selected from personal and public perspectives, including travel costs, crowding degree, occupied area, traffic emissions, and operating subsidies. The objective functions of these factors were transformed into satisfaction functions, and a multi-objective programming model was used to solve for the optimal proportions of the ground bus and rail transit, and the carbon emission reduction potential was analyzed in different scenarios. The study showed that the actual proportion of rail transit in Shanghai was slightly lower than the optimal value, and accompanied by low satisfaction with each factor relative to the optimal value. It was difficult to achieve the traffic emission reduction targets by only reducing satisfaction with other factors except carbon emissions assuming a fixed proportion of public transport. As the proportion of total travel represented by public transport increased, rail transit became the main mode of public transport and the usage trend was more obvious, but the structure of public transport gradually reached a relatively stable state after a certain level of development. Compared to reducing carbon emissions by changing satisfaction with other factors, it was easier to achieve traffic emission reduction targets by increasing the proportion of public transport.

Zero-emission options have been less explored and are less developed in the energy-intensive basic materials industries than in other sectors. Current climate policies have not yet motivated major efforts to decarbonize this sector, and it has been largely protected from climate policy due to the perceived risks of carbon leakage and a focus on short-term reduction targets to 2020. We argue that the future global climate policy regime must develop along three interlinked and strategic lines to facilitate a deep decarbonization of energy-intensive industries. First, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility must be reinterpreted to allow for a dialogue on fairness and the right to development in relation to industry. Second, a greater focus on the development, deployment and transfer of technology in this sector is called for. Third, the potential conflicts between current free trade regimes and motivated industrial policies for deep decarbonization must be resolved. One way forward is to revisit the idea of sectoral approaches with a broader scope, including not only emission reductions, but recognizing the full complexity of low-carbon transitions in energy-intensive industries. A new approach could engage industrial stakeholders, support technology research, development and demonstration and facilitate deployment through reducing the risk for investors. The Paris Agreement allows the idea of sectoral approaches to be revisited in the interests of reaching our common climate goals. Policy relevance Deep decarbonization of energy-intensive industries will be necessary to meet the 2 \u00b0C target. This requires major innovation efforts over a long period. Energy-intensive industries face unique challenges from both innovation and technical perspectives due to the large scale of facilities, the character of their global markets and the potentially high mitigation costs.

This paper assesses possible solutions through scenario building in a backcasting manner by using the Transport Issues in the Long Term model. In particular, three scenarios that address how technology and various public policies can contribute to a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions are evaluated. Furthermore, estimates of infrastructure investment needs as well as insight into how transport budgets (time and monetary) could evolve in each of the following three scenarios presented are proposed: the Pegasus scenario, in which strict technology standards are promoted; the Chronos scenario, in which green multimodalities are promoted; and the Hestia scenario, in which the decoupling of transport and growth in the gross domestic product is promoted. Each scenario allows the types of results that can be obtained through different policy mixes to be quickly comprehended.

Bio-oil feedstock was produced using whole southern pine (Pinus taeda) trees, chipped, and converted into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis. Input parameters and mass and energy balances were derived with Aspen. Mass and energy balances were input to SimaPro to determine the environmental performance of bio-oil compared with residual fuel oil as a heating fuel. Equivalent functional units of 1 MJ were used for demonstrating environmental preference in impact categories, such as fossil fuel use and global warming potential. Results showed near carbon neutrality of the bio-oil. Substituting bio-oil for residual fuel oil, based on the relative carbon emissions of the two fuels, estimated a reduction in CO2 emissions by 0.075 kg CO2 per MJ of fuel combustion or a 70 percent reduction in emission over residual fuel oil. The bio-oil production life-cycle stage consumed 92 percent of the total cradle-to-grave energy requirements, while feedstock collection, preparation, and transportation consumed 4 percent each. This model provides a framework to better understand the major factors affecting greenhouse gas emissions related to bio-oil production and conversion to boiler fuel during fast pyrolysis.

This article presents a life cycle assessment for production of CO2-based polyethercarbonate polyols in a real industrial pilot plant. The considered cradle-to-gate system boundaries include polyol production and all upstream processes such as provision of energy and feedstocks. In particular, provision of CO2 from a lignite power plant equipped with a pilot plant for CO2 capture is considered. Production of polyols with 20 wt% CO2 in the polymer chains causes GHG emissions of 2.65\u20132.86 kg CO2-eq kg \u22121 and thus, does not act as GHG sink. However, compared to production of conventional polyether polyols, production of polyols with 20 wt% CO2 allows for GHG reductions of 11\u201319%. Relating GHG emission reductions to the amount of CO2 incorporated, up to three kg CO2-eq emissions can be avoided per kg CO2 utilized. The use of fossil resources can be reduced by 13\u201316%. The impacts reductions increase with further increasing the CO2 content in the polyols. All other investigated environmental impacts such as eutrophication, ionizing radiation, ozone depletion, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, and terrestrial acidification are also lowered.

In a field experiment with three water management treatments,\nwe measured N2O\nisotope ratios of emitted and pore air N2O\n(\u03b415N, \u03b418O and site preference, SP) over the\ncourse of 6\u00a0weeks in the early rice growing season.

As ozone formation is currently VOC-limited in the Basin, model simulations with 2030 baseline emissions (\u221261% for NOx and \u221232% for VOC from 2008) predict 10\u201320% higher peak ozone levels (i.e., NOx disbenefit) in the western and central SoCAB compared with the 2008 base simulation. With additional NOx reductions of 50% beyond the 2030 baseline emissions (\u221281% from 2008), the predicted ozone levels are reduced by about 15% in the eastern SoCAB but remain comparable to 2008 levels in the western and central Basin. The Basin maximum ozone site shifts westward to more populated areas of the Basin and will result potentially in greater population-weighted exposure to ozone with even a relatively small shortfall in the required NOx reductions unless accompanied by additional VOC reductions beyond 2030 baseline levels. Once committed to a NOx-focused control strategy, NOx reductions exceeding 90% from 2008 levels will be necessary to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The findings from this study and other recent work that the current VOC emission estimates are underestimated by about 50% suggest that greater future VOC reductions will be necessary to reach the projected 2030 baseline emissions. Increasing the base year VOC emissions by a factor of 1.5 result in higher 2008 baseline ozone predictions, lower relative response factors, and about 20% lower projected design values. If correct, these findings have important implications for the total and optimum mix of VOC and NOx emission reductions that will be required to attain the ozone NAAQS in the SoCAB. Implications: Results of this study indicate that ozone levels in the western and central SoCAB would remain the same or increase with even a relatively small shortfall in the projected NOx reductions under planned NOx-focused controls. This possibility, therefore, warrants a rigorous analysis of the costs and effects of varying reductions of VOC and NOx on the formation and combined health impacts of ozone and secondary particles.

Moreover, both fuels comprise a good mixture formation superior to the one of ethanol, especially under difficult boundary conditions.

Theory predicts that P+4 is the dominant ion in the winds of O7-O9.7 stars, although an empirical estimator suggests that the range O4-O7 may be more appropriate. However, we find that the mass-loss rates obtained from P v wind profiles are systematically smaller than those obtained from fits to H alpha emission profiles or radio free-free emission by median factors of similar to 130 (if P+4 is dominant between O7 and O9.7) or similar to 20 (if P+4 is dominant between O4 and O7). These discordant measurements can be reconciled if the winds of O stars in the relevant temperature range are strongly clumped on small spatial scales.

The authors model an increase in the price of gasoline, which should affect the ownership and use of cars and two-wheelers, as well as imposing a license fee on cars to retard growth in car ownership. The impact of each policy on emissions depends not only on how the policy affects the mode that is regulated, but on shifts to other modes. The results suggest that the most effective policy to reduce emissions from passenger vehicles-in terms of the total number of tons of PM10 (particulate matter that measure less than or equal to 10 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter) reduced-is to convert diesel buses to CNG. The conversion of 3,391 diesel buses to CNG would result in an emissions reduction of 663 tons of PM10 a year, 14 percent of total emissions from transport. The bus conversion program passes the cost-benefit test. In contrast, the results suggest the elasticities of emissions from transport with respect to a gasoline tax and a tax on vehicle ownership are -0.04 and -0.10 respectively. As a consequence, it would take substantial increases in the gasoline tax or vehicle ownership tax to produce reductions in emissions similar to the bus conversion program.

The impact of ground-level ozone (O3) on vegetation is largely under-investigated at the global scale despite large areas worldwide that are exposed to high surface O3 levels. To explore future potential impacts of O3 on vegetation, we compared historical and projected surface O3 concentrations simulated by six global atmospheric chemistry transport models on the basis of three representative concentration pathways emission scenarios (i.e. RCP2.6, 4.5, 8.5). To assess changes in the potential surface O3 threat to vegetation at the global scale, we used the AOT40 metric.

In fact, many areas of the Northern Hemisphere show that AOT40-based critical levels will be exceeded by a\u00a0factor of at least 10 under RCP8.5.

The HiTAC technology has evolved from the conception of excess enthalpy combustion (EEC) to high and ultra-high preheated air combustion. In the HiTAC method, combined heat regeneration and low oxygen methods are utilized to enlarge and control the flame thermal behavior. This technology has shown promise for much wider applications in various process and power industries, energy conversion, and waste to clean fuel conversion. For each application the flow, thermal, and chemical behavior of HiTAC flames must be carefully tailored to satisfy the specific needs. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on several gas-air diffusion flames using high-temperature combustion air.'A specially designed regenerative combustion test furnace facility, built by Nippon Furnace Kogyo, Japan, was used to preheat the combustion air to elevated temperatures. The flames with highly preheated combustion air were significantly more stable and homogeneous (both temporally and spatially) as compared to the flames with room-temperature combustion air. The global flame features showed the flame color to change from yellow to blue to bluish-green to green over the range of conditions examined. In some cases hybrid and purple color flame was also observed. Under certain conditions flameless or colorless oxidation of the fuel has also been demonstrated. Information on global flame features, flame spectral emission characteristics, spatial distribution of OH, CH, and C 2 species and emission of pollutants has been obtained. Low levels of NO x along with negligible levels of CO and HC have been obtained using high-temperature combustion air. The thermal and chemical behavior of high-temperature air combustion flames depends on fuel property, preheat temperature, and oxygen concentration of air. Waste heat from a furnace in high-temperature air combustion technology is retrieved and introduced back into the furnace using regenerator. These features help save energy, which subsequently also reduce the emission of CO 2 (greenhouse gas) to the environment. Flames with high temperature air provide significantly higher and uniform heat flux than normal air, which reduces the equipment size or increases the process material throughput for same size of the equipment. The high-temperature air combustion technology can provide significant energy savings (up to about 60%), downsizing of the equipment (about 30%), and pollution reduction (about 25%).

Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk.

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study 19 patients with unilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease (greater than 66% diameter reduction) and no evidence of cerebral infarction. According to PET measurements in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the lesion, 7 patients had normal cerebral hemodynamics, 8 had reduced perfusion pressure with normal blood flow, and 4 had reduced blood flow. Neither the percent stenosis nor the residual lumen diameter in the carotid artery was a reliable indicator of the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation. However, a significant relationship was found between the PET measurements of cerebral hemodynamics and the arteriographic circulation pattern (p = 0.006).

With feasible technical interventions in livestock production systems, the mitigation potential of each of the selected species, systems and regions ranges from 14 to 41\u00a0%. While comparably high mitigation potentials were estimated for ruminant and pig production systems in Asia, Latin America and Africa, large emission reductions can also be attained in dairy systems with already high levels of productivity, in OECD countries. Mitigation interventions can lead to a concomitant reduction in emissions and increase in production, contributing to food security. This is particularly the case for improved feeding practices and better health and herd management practices.

Net emissions were also estimated for three scenarios (low (L), medium (M) and high (H)) of adoption of sink enhancing practices above the projected 2008 level. Carbon sequestration estimates were based on four sink-enhancing activities: conversion from conventional to zero tillage (ZT), reduced frequency of summerfallow (SF), the conversion of cropland to permanent cover crops (PC), and improved grazing land management (GM). GHG emissions were estimated with the Canadian Economic and Emissions Model for Agriculture (CEEMA). CEEMA estimates levels of production activities within the Canadian agriculture sector and calculates the emissions and removals associated with those levels of activities. The estimates indicate a decline in net emissions from 54 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 in1990 to 52 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 in 2008. Adoption of thesink-enhancing practices above the level projected for 2008 resulted in further declines in emissions to 48 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (L), 42 TgCO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (M) or 36 Tg CO2\u2013Eq yr\u22121 (H). Among thesink-enhancing practices, the conversion from conventional tillage to ZT provided the largest C sequestration potential and net reduction in GHG emissions among the scenarios. Although rates of C sequestration were generally higher for conversion of cropland to PC and adoption of improved GM, those scenarios involved smaller areas of land and therefore less C sequestration. Also, increased areas of PC were associated with an increase in livestock numbers and CH4 and N2O emissions from enteric fermentation andmanure, which partially offset the carbon sink. The CEEMA estimates indicate that soil C sinks are a viable option for achieving the UNFCCC objective of protecting and enhancing GHG sinks and reservoirs as a means of reducing GHG emissions (UNFCCC, 1992).", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "851895ac55f356a1a02e0950507d4efd8229da53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2151973266", "DOI": "10.1093/JNCI/DJM232", "CorpusId": 37160124, "PubMed": "18042932"}, "title": "18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer: a systematic review.", "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in industrialized countries. The overall mortality rate for lung cancer is high, and early diagnosis provides the best chance for survival. Diagnostic tests guide lung cancer management decisions, and clinicians increasingly use diagnostic imaging in an effort to improve the management of patients with lung cancer. This systematic review, an expansion of a health technology assessment conducted in 2001 by the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences, evaluates the accuracy and utility of 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Through a systematic search of the literature, we identified relevant health technology assessments, randomized trials, and meta-analyses published since the earlier review, including 12 evidence summary reports and 15 prospective studies of the diagnostic accuracy of PET. PET appears to have high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for differentiating benign from malignant lesions as small as 1 cm. PET appears superior to computed tomography imaging for mediastinal staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized trials evaluating the utility of PET in potentially resectable NSCLC report conflicting results in terms of the relative reduction in the number of noncurative thoracotomies. PET has not been studied as extensively in patients with small-cell lung cancer, but the available data show that it has good accuracy in staging extensive- versus limited-stage disease. Although the current evidence is conflicting, PET may improve results of early-stage lung cancer by identifying patients who have evidence of metastatic disease that is beyond the scope of surgical resection and that is not evident by standard preoperative staging procedures. Further trials are necessary to establish the clinical utility of PET as part of the standard preoperative assessment of early-stage lung cancer.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "9f63286b9451ad73ffcf87bb755cc63374654359", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1587233987", "DOI": "10.1080/13504509.2015.1049674", "CorpusId": 154242700}, "title": "Assessing carbon footprint in the life cycle of accommodation services: the case of an international tourist hotel", "abstract": "The accommodation sector is the most demanding energy consumer among all building stock categories. This study quantifies an international tourist hotel in Taiwan to holistically estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of hotel accommodation services through a complete life cycle inventory. The study also investigates the difference between the carbon emissions of the baseline and reduction years to understand the effects of carbon emission reduction on the hotel industry. Results show that energy consumption is the main source of carbon footprint. However, the carbon emissions of other activities, such as the production and transportation of hotel amenities and laundry services, are 15.90% for the baseline year and 16.03% for the reduction year. These values are larger than the 5% cutoff rule according to PAS 2050. Thus, these factors should also be considered in assessing the carbon emissions of accommodation services. Hotel occupancy rate significantly affects carbon emissions during a one-night stay in a standard room as the functional unit. The selection of the functional unit should be considered in the hotel strategy. Although this case study involves an international tourist hotel in Taiwan, the findings and recommendations for improvements can be applied elsewhere.", "year": 2015}]}
