This means a re-design with the goal of implementing the EU's internal market and far-reaching decarbonisation. The example of Germany's energy U-turn shows one possible route, one that is marked by a massive expansion of renewable energies coupled with a phase-out of nuclear energy. Other European countries are pursuing different strategies. Current developments show that solutions chosen in any one country have direct implications for its neighbours. This is because electricity markets are continuing to grow together. In a spirit of solidarity between the member states, the closest possible review and coordination and/or harmonisation of policies are needed. This will allow the conversion process, which is associated with macro-economic costs, to be shaped on a cost-efficient basis. For utilities, the energy turnaround brings with it a multitude of challenges. Utilities must convert their generation portfolio and, in particular, perceptibly increase their share of low-carbon energies. Conventional power plants must be designed flexibly, so that - besides volatility in consumption - fluctuations in the feed-in of renewable energies, too, can be offset. In addition to this technical requirement, energy suppliers are facing a situation in which the utilisation period of conventional power stations is falling as a result of the growing feed-in of renewables. On top of this comes the fact that wholesale electricity prices on sunny days are pushed down despite high demand owing to the growing feed-in of electricity from photovoltaic systems. Both factors limit the options for obtaining the necessary contributions to cover fixed costs on the market. This raises the issue of the market design of the future. The launch of capacity mechanisms, ie remuneration for the product 'firm capacity' supplementing the income obtained from the sale of electricity, could help. At the same time, capacity mechanisms could be a suitable instrument for coping with power failures. This brings politics into the game. With electricity markets growing together, the central requirement to be met by a capacity-market mechanism is that harmonised regulations, a discrimination-free design and technology neutrality are ensured throughout Europe. This is regarded as indispensable for creating a level playing field. Also as regards reaching the goal of Europe's climate policy, viz. a lowering of greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared with 1990, the rule must be to prioritise European solutions over any national regulation. In addition, a procedure in climate policy that is more stringently reviewed at international level is considered unavoidable. Cost efficiency in reaching climate goals means backing market instruments. CO2 emissions trading should be accorded the role of leading instrument in climate protection. The instrument can be used to achieve agreed quantity targets for CO2 emissions reliably and at the least possible costs. One argument in favour of anchoring the trade in emissions as leading instrument to shape a sustainable energy supply is that the costs of transforming the energy system can be kept within bounds. Renewable energies enter the system with rising CO2 prices on a market-driven basis. The various technologies compete with one another and with other CO2-avoidance technologies, like increases in efficiency, utilisation of nuclear energy and CO2 capture and storage (CCS). One current study says that the expected growth in electricity consumption in the EU by some 1,000 TWh by 2050 will be covered by adding renewable energies if the focus is on trade in emissions as leading instrument. This doubles the share of renewables in power generation by 2050 to about 50%. After 2030, with rising CO2 prices, CCS, too, becomes profitable. If we were to rule out this technology for lowering CO2, much higher costs for the aimed-at decarbonisation of power generation would have to be accepted.",10.1260/0958-305X.26.1-2.111,2015.0

Most focus has been on the negative environmental effects of using fossil fuels. However, looking at the development there seems to be important barriers for change. Many papers and reports conclude that the renewable energy sources have the potential to run the world and the technology needed to do so is available. A relevant and important question in this paper is then why is this potential only marginally utilized? Often the high prices of renewables are said to be one barrier and that technology change will gradually increase the advantages of renewable energy. However considerations based solely on thermodynamics and energy systems analysis, no matter how simple they are, lead to a very serious conclusion, namely that the utilization of renewable energy does not support continuous growth as we know it. In order to develop pathways for change, scenarios can be used to support decision making involving all key actors in society. In this paper we outline the driving forces why we ended up in the energy systems we have today. The competition between fossil fuels and renewable energy must be analyzed at a more fundamental thermodynamic level. This analysis has also to include the links between energy and material transformation. Understanding this we can outline possible roadmaps for transitions to more sustainable energy and material systems starting from primary energy sources. The strong dependence on fossil fuels now will require long transitions periods for change. However it is important to start the transitions taking small steps forward. The problem related to fossil fuels and climate change will not be solved in due time. The only realistic options here is Carbon Capture and storage together with climate change adaption. One difficulty in making scenarios is to handle changes in technology and people's behavior. By developing evolutionary forecasting scenarios (EFS) different roadmaps can be evaluated, including continuous and discontinuous technology change. The key parameter that will determine the inevitable transitions in energy use and the future of our civilization is the emergy yield ratio we can obtain from the renewable energy sources. For material transformation conservation of low entropy states will be of high importance. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.671,2015.0

CO2 originates principally from the raw meal calcination stage and conventional fuel (e.g. coal) combustion for the thermal needs of the process. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is among the examined technologies for mitigating CO2 emissions generated in a cement plant. A very competitive technology for CO2 capture from flue gases appears to be Calcium Looping (CaL). The process is realized in a dual fluidized bed system where CO2 is absorbed by CaO in the first reactor (carbonator), and the produced CaCO3 is regenerated in the second oxy - fired reactor (calciner). During calcination, CO2 is released from the sorbents, purified, compressed and finally led to storage. Among the advantages of CaL when compared against other CO2 capturing technologies that could be applied in the cement industry, are the familiarity of the sector with the management (extraction, storage, feeding, etc.) of CaO-bearing materials and the prospect of reusing purge CaO in cement making as it is chemically compatible with cement raw meal. This study describes the process modeling of the CaL implementation on a typical (no by-pass) five-stage preheater with pre-calciner cement plant as a retrofit option, in order to capture the CO2 produced through the clinker production. The process simulations were performed with the commercial software ASPEN Plus (TM) in conjunction with house-built models for the CaL process itself. A detailed description of the process configuration of the CO2 capture unit including its integration with the CO2 purification scheme and the basic parameters for the clinker production line are presented. Simulation results revealed that high S content in the supplementary fuel affects negatively the CaL performance and the quality of purge CaO in terms of replacing limestone in the kiln feed. Using low-sulfur coal for a 90% capture rate, a total purge CaO utilization can be achieved along with a raw limestone substitution of 8% and a net electricity yield of 426.66 kWh/t clinker. The economic evaluation of the proposed concept was also performed, estimating that the cost for CO2 avoidance equals approx. 68.75 sic/tCO(2). In terms of economic efficiency, CaL was found to be comparable to amine scrubbing. Give that CaL has not been examined so extensively as MEA, it has the potential for technical improvements in order to become more competitive by the adoption of novel concepts with smaller equipment cost.

Thus, energy consumption and corresponding high operation cost become two primary challenges for the promotion of CCS technology. Meanwhile, energy from the solar source in various forms has already been successfully used as an effective alternative supply in the industrial section for drying, heating and even cooling. Thus, integrating solar energy utilization into the CCS process could be a reasonable option for a sustainable development. A comparative analysis of CCS integrated with solar energy was presented in this paper based on the existing researches. The current status on typical configuration structure, feature and energy-efficiency performance of integrating options is reviewed for post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxygen-combustion systems. Based on these typical CO2 capture systems, a theoretical analysis is conducted for an energy-efficient comparison. Then four typical structures of the post-combustion system, which are highlighted in the review, are chosen as comparative objects for energy-saving and techno-economic evaluation. The results show that systems with a solar-assisted thermal energy and power generation have comparative advantages in term of carbon emission intensity, but the economic cost is increased under the current conditions of the equipment price. Compared to that of baseline case, carbon emission intensity of the case integrated with solar Organic Rankine Cycle can be reduced with a maximum decline of 9.73%, meanwhile the levelized costs of electricity increases 0.01 USD/kW h correspondingly.

Coal will continue to play a major role in the new installed power generation capacity in the future, which will cause unavoidable environmental problems. Clean coal technologies (CCTs) are essential for emissions reduction in the power sector. In general, CCTs cover coal upgrading, efficiency improvements, advanced technologies and zero emissions technologies. Besides these, CCTs also include other emissions reduction technologies and comprehensive utilization technologies in China. This paper review the complete life cycle modeling of CCTs. The advanced technologies include super-critical (super-C), ultra super-critical (USC) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). The results show that the higher efficiency technologies have lower potential impacts. Compared with the average level of power generation technology, CO2 emissions reduction is 6.4% for super-C, 37.4% for USC and 61.5% for IGCC. Four coal power scenarios are developed based on the assumption of potential investment power for CCTs in 2020, which are super-C, USC, USC and old low efficiency generation substitution by USC, IGCC and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The CO2 emissions intensity is 1.93 kg/kWh for super-C, 1.69 kg/kWh for USC, 1.59 kg/kWh for USC + replacement and 1.29 kg/kWh for IGCC + CCS. The CO2 emissions intensity was 1.95 kg/kWh in 2010, which had decreased 5.5% compared with the level in 2005. The energy structure is continuously being improved and optimized. The potential carbon reduction will be limited in the power system in 2020 by current commercial CCTs with the generation efficiency increase. The most impressive technology is IGCC with CCS which enables greenhouse gas reduction of 37.6% compared with the level in 2005. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, various energy conservation and carbon emission reduction technologies, including the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, as well as other clean, low-carbon energy exploitation technologies exhibit a rapid development trend to alleviate the growing crisis of climate change. Other than traditional CO2 geological storage, a novel geoengineering approach of CO2 geological utilization and storage, named CO2 geological storage combining with deep saline water/brine recovery (CO2-EWR), is put forward to solve the dilemma between the increasing carbon emissions from coal chemical industry and national energy and water security in China. Compared with the traditional CCS technology, CO2-EWR has two advantages: (1) it can control the relief of reservoir pressure and water production by a reasonable design of pumping wells to achieve the security and stability of the large-scale geological storage of CO2; (2) it can collect and process deep saline water after a treatment for life drinking, industrial and/or agricultural utilizations to alleviate the water shortage situation as well as ecological environmental problems, and in addition, the deep brine resources may create considerable profit margins by cascade extraction, which could be used to fill the gap of cost primarily criticized from capture and sequestration processes of current CCS technologies. China mainland can be partitioned into three potential CO2-EWR zones primarily according to different types of aquifer system, whereas considering research and development maturity and cost prediction of the potential technology adopted, it can be found that coal power and coal chemical enterprises in China's western region have an early opportunity. Three sub-modules of CO2-EWR technology including CO2 storage in deep saline aquifer, saline water extraction and desalination as well as brine resources utilization are analyzed from a prospective of energy conservation, carbon emission reduction and environmental friendship. Through detailed analyses, it can be concluded that CO2-EWR technology can be absolutely considered as a clean technology for environmental improvement and green development, and finally development direction and future prospective of the CO2-EWR technology are pointed out.

Domestic natural gas fields are a plentiful energy resource but it is projected to be available only for the next decade. Using domestic natural gas would reduce national energy security. However, coal will dominate in electricity generation in Thailand due to its low price. Utilization of coal results in increasing CO2 emissions. To comply with the low-carbon society policy of the Royal Thai Government, a high target of achievement in alternative energy share of 20.40% in total energy consumption in 2022 has been proposed. The obvious answer to this challenge is to take advantage of Thailand as an agriculture-based country, especially in domestic renewable energy and clean power generation. Thailand's renewable power development plan strategy is considered by increasing the share to 2.40% in 2024. Electricity generation in this scenario is compared with future fossil-based power plants with carbon capture and storage and nuclear power in the long-term energy planning. Finally, the low carbon socity scenario for the emission abatement policy is introduced to mitigate emissions. Results are presented in total supply system cost, the incremental cost of CO2 mitigation and the co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation when compared to the business-as-usual scenario.

Post-combustion capture and storage (CCS) namely with amine FG+, and oxy-fuel with carbon capture and storage (oxy-fuel) are applied to a 650 MW pulverized combustion (PC) plant. The impacts of the Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) and carbon price (CP) policy in accelerating the CCS deployment in the framework of GHG emissions mitigation, are also evaluated. The operational factors affecting CCS costs and emissions in the power generation plants are taken into consideration, hence, the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM 8.0.2) is employed for a systematic estimation of plant performance, costs and emissions of different scenarios of fuel and CCS technologies. This study showed that the utilization of white wood pellets (WWP) in electricity generation can annually avoid about 3 M tonnes CO2 emissions from a 650 MW power plant. However, this mitigation process had impact on the plant efficiency and the cost of electricity. Further, the BECCS using white wood pellets has showed a better efficiency and lower cost of electricity with the oxy-fuel technology than the post-combustion CCS technology. However, in order to boost biomass energy CCS (BECCS) deployment with the WWP, an increase of the ROC for biomass power plants, or, an increase of the carbon price for the coal power plants is recommended. It was found that, the sensitivity of COE towards the ROC was higher than towards the carbon price variation. This result can be interpreted as the ROC has more positive impact than the carbon price, on the COE from the point of customers view without adding more burdens on the power generation companies.

We also design a novel CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) network for economic benefit through utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. Both the designs of CCUS and CCU supply chain networks are multi-scale problems which require decision making at material, process and supply chain levels. We present a hierarchical and multi-scale framework to design CCUS and CCU supply chain networks with minimum investment, operating and material costs. While doing so, we take into consideration the selection of source plants, capture processes, capture materials, CO2 pipelines, locations of utilization and sequestration sites, and amounts of CO2 storage. Each CO2 capture process is optimized, and the best materials are screened from large pool of candidate materials. Our optimized CCUS supply chain network can reduce 50% of the total stationary CO2 emission in the U.S. at a cost of $35.63 per ton of CO2 captured and managed. The optimum CCU supply chain network can capture and utilize CO2 to make a total profit of more than 555 million dollars per year ($9.23 per ton). We have also shown that more than 3% of the total stationary CO2 emissions in the United States can be eliminated through CCU networks at zero net cost. These results highlight both the environmental and economic benefits which can be gained through CCUS and CCU networks. We have designed the CCUS and CCU networks through (i) selecting novel materials and optimized process configurations for CO2 capture, (ii) simultaneous selection of materials and capture technologies, (iii) CO2 capture from diverse emission sources, and (iv) CO2 utilization for enhanced oil recovery.

In the United States (US), biomass policy has focused on biofuels. However, this paper will investigate three options for biopower: low co-firing (co-firing scenarios refer to combusting a given percentage of biomass with coal) (5%-10% biomass), medium co-firing (15%-20% biomass), and dedicated biomass firing (100% biomass). We analyze the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact of each of these options, with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Our analysis shows that in the absence of land use change emissions, all biomass co-combustion scenarios result in a decrease in GHG emissions over coal generation alone. The two biggest barriers to biopower are concerns about carbon neutrality of biomass fuels and the high cost compared to today's electricity prices. This paper recommends two policy actions.

We suggest that developing a large-scale, visible, and financially viable CCUS network could potentially overcome many barriers to deployment and jumpstart commercial-scale CCUS. To date, substantial effort has focused on technology development to reduce the costs of CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. Here, we propose that near-term investment could focus on implementing CO2 capture on facilities that produce high-value chemicals/products. These facilities can absorb the expected impact of the marginal increase in the cost of production on the price of their product, due to the addition of CO2 capture, more than coal-fired power plants. A financially viable demonstration of a large-scale CCUS network requires offsetting the costs of CO2 capture by using the CO2 as an input to the production of market-viable products.

Photocataltyic reduction of CO2 is one of the promising routes in CO2 conversion and utilization (CCU) but is hurdled by its very low conversion. This work, for the first time, integrates CO2 capture and photocatalytic conversion (CCPC) by using a novel hybrid adsorbent/photocatalyst (TiO2 nanoparticles supported on MgAl layered double oxides, i.e., MgAl(LDO)/TiO2), with CO2 adsorption, desorption and conversion to Cl products operated near power plant flue gas temperatures (100-200 degrees C). The proportions of desorption and conversion of the captured CO2 could be manipulated by tuning the reaction temperature, the atomic ratio of adsorbent to photocatalyst, and the dispersion and crystallinity of TiO2 particles. Experimental results show that the hybrid MgAl(LDO)/TiO2 not only has a much higher CO2 capture capacity than bare MgAl(LDO) and TiO2, but also converts 13-15% CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) with a 93-95% overall self-regeneration rate during five adsorption/conversion/regeneration cycles. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses have demonstrated that photo-illumination can activate and convert the strongly adsorbed species that cannot be achieved by thermal desorption alone at the same temperature. The novel CCPC process, with further advancement in the materials and reaction design, may provide a competitive alternative to the current carbon management technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is regarded as the most effective way to reduce such atmospheric CO2 concentrations, has several environmental and technical disadvantages. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU), which has been introduced to cover such disadvantages, makes it possible to capture CO2, recycling byproducts as resources. However, CCU also requires large amounts of energy in order to induce reactions. Among existing CCU technologies, the process for converting CO2 into CaCO3 requires high temperature and high pressure as reaction conditions. This study proposes a method to fixate CaCO3 stably by using relatively less energy than existing methods. After forming NaOH absorbent solution through electrolysis of NaCl in seawater, CaCO3 was precipitated at room temperature and pressure. Following the experiment, the resulting product CaCO3 was analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were also analyzed. The results showed that the CaCO3 crystal product was high-purity calcite.

We used a global computable general equilibrium model, and evaluated the effectiveness of emission trading using welfare losses associated with climate mitigation for scenarios with and without emission trading, as measured by the Hicksian Equivalent Variation (HEV). We found that emission trading contributed to a reduction in the economic losses associated with climate mitigation for all technological assumptions, burden sharing schemes, and stabilization targets. The net global welfare losses in scenarios without emission trading ranged between 0.7% and 1.9%, whereas emission trading reduced the losses by 0.1% to 0.5%. The range depended on the assumptions in the burden sharing schemes, technological constraints, and stabilization targets. The percentage change in welfare gain from emission trading varied regionally, and was relatively high in low-income or middle-income countries (0.2% to 1.0% and -0.1% to 1.2%, respectively) compared to high-income countries (-0.1% to 03%). Some regions displayed negative values with regard to the effectiveness of emission trading, which might be due to the change in goods and service trades associated with emission trading. If the usage of carbon capture and storage was constrained, welfare loss became large and the effectiveness of emission trading ultimately increased. The use of a burden sharing scheme was a significant factor in changing the effectiveness of emission trading, and the per capita emission convergence in 2050 was more effective for emission trading than a per income convergence.

This paper introduces a new algebraic method for targeting the optimum CO2 capture, utilisation and storage based on the Pinch Analysis approach. A new Total Site CO2 Integration concept is introduced. The concept is to capture CO2 with certain quality from various plants on the Total Site and inject it into CO2 headers. The CO2 headers are divided into certain composition ranges. The CO2 headers can satisfy the CO2 demands for various industries located along the headers, which require CO2 as its raw material. The CO2 can be further regenerated, and mixed as needed with pure CO2 generated from one or multiple centralised CO2 plant if required. The excess CO2 is to be sent to geological storage. The proper utilisation of CO2 will reduce the amount of CO2 needed to be stored. This will extend the geological carbon storage-life capacity.

To broaden the usage of geological storage as a viable climate mitigation option, it is vital to understand CO2 behaviour after its injection within a storage reservoir, including its potential migration through overlying sediments, as well as biogeochemical and ecological impacts in the event of leakage. The impacts of a CO2 release were investigated by a controlled release experiment that injected CO2 at a known flux into shallow, under-consolidated marine sediments for 37 days. Repeated high-resolution 2D seismic reflection surveying, both pre-release and syn-release, allows the detection of CO2-related anomalies, including: seismic chimneys; enhanced reflectors within the subsurface; and bubbles within the water column. In addition, reflection coefficient and seismic attenuation values calculated for each repeat survey, allow the impact of CO2 flux on sediment acoustic properties to be comparatively monitored throughout the gas release. CO2 migration is interpreted as being predominantly controlled by sediment stratigraphy in the early stages of the experiment.

The recycled CO2 from the gas turbine acted as an effective heat source for the gasifier as well as gasifying agent. The positive effect of CO2-recycling was more prominent at the lower gasifier temperature. The utilization of high quality feedstock, i.e. low moisture content and low O/C ratio, was favorable for optimizing the effect of CO2-recycling on the system efficiency. Under the examined conditions, the optimum conditions for gaining the highest system efficiency, 39,4%, were a gasifier temperature of 850 degrees C with CO2 recycling ratio of 0.87 and the torrefied feedstock. Application of carbon capture and storage process to the system at the optimum condition resulted in 1.75 kg-CO2/kg-dry-biomass negative carbon intensity with merely 6.5% efficiency penalty. These results show that the CO2-recycling gasification system is promising for effectively applying BECCS concept.",,2015.0

This process, however, emits a considerable amount of CO2, ultimately negating the benefit of using H-2 as a clean industrial feedstock and energy carrier. That has prompted growing interest in enabling CO2 capture from SMR for either storage or utilisation and producing zero-emission ""blue H-2"". In this paper, we propose a spatial techno-economic framework for assessing blue hydrogen production SMR hubs with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), using Australia as a case study. Australia offers a unique opportunity for developing such 'blue H-2' hubs given its extensive natural gas resources, availability of known carbon storage reservoirs and an ambitious government target to produce clean/zero-emission H-2 at the cost of <A$2 kg(-1) by 2030. Our results highlight that the H2 production costs are unsurprisingly dominated by natural gas, with the additional capital requirement of carbon capture and storage (CCS) also playing a critical role. These outcomes are especially pertinent for eastern Australian states, as they are experiencing high natural gas costs and would generally require extensive CO2 transport and storage infrastructure to tap potential storage reservoirs, ultimately resulting in a higher cost of producing H-2 (>A$2.7 kgH(2)(-1)). On the other hand, Western Australia offers lower gas pricing and relatively lesser storage costs, which would lead to more economically favourable hydrogen production (<A$2.2 kg(H2)(-1)). We further explore the possibility of utilising the emissions captured at blue SMR hubs by converting them into formic acid through CO2 electroreduction, yielding revenue that will decrease the cost of blue H-2 and reduce the reliance on CO2 storage. Our analysis reveals that formic acid production utilising a 10 MW CO2 electrolyser can potentially reduce H-2 production costs by between 4 and 9%. Further cost reduction is possible by scaling the CO2 electrolyser capacity to convert a larger portion of the emissions captured, albeit at the cost of higher capital investment, electricity consumption and saturating the market for formic acid. Thus, carbon utilisation for a range of products with high market demand represents a more promising approach to replacing the need for costly carbon storage. Overall, our modelling framework can be adapted for global application, particularly for regions interested in generating blue H2 and extended to include other CO2 utilisation opportunities and evaluate other hydrogen production technologies.

Subsequently, leading to the greenhouse gas effect and climate change and contemporarily, quest and usage of fossil fuels has increased dramatically in recent times. The only solution to resolve the problem of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is geological/subsurface storage of carbon dioxide or carbon capture and storage (CCS). Additionally, CO2 can be employed in the oil and gas fields for enhanced oil recovery operations and this cyclic form of the carbon dioxide injection into reservoirs for recovering oil and gas is known as CO2 Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery (EOGR). Hence, this paper presents the CO2 retention dominance in tight oil and gas reservoirs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) of the Alberta Province, Canada. Actually, hysteresis modeling was applied in the oil and gas reservoirs of WCSB for sequestering or trapping CO2 and EOR as well. Totally, four cases were taken for the investigation, such as WCSB Alberta tight oil and gas reservoirs with CO2 huff-n-puff and flooding processes. Actually, Canada has complex geology and therefore, implicate that it can serve as a promising candidate that is suitable and safer place for CO2 storage. Furthermore, injection pressure, time, rate (mass), number of cycles, soaking time, fracture half-length, conductivity, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure were taken as input parameters and cumulative oil production and oil recovery factor are the output parameters, this is mainly for tight oil reservoirs. In the tight gas reservoirs, only the output parameters differ from the oil reservoir, such as cumulative gas production and gas recovery factor. Reservoirs were modelled to operate for 30 years of oil and gas production and the factor year was designated as decision-making unit (DMU). CO2 retention was estimated in all four models and overall the gas retention in four cases showed a near sinusoidal behavior and the variations are sporadic. More than 80% CO2 retention in these tight formations were achieved and the major influencing factors that govern the CO2 storage in these tight reservoirs are injection pressure, time, mass, number of cycles, and soaking time. In general, the subsurface geology of the Canada is very complex consisting with many structural and stratigraphic layers and thus, it offers safe location for CO2 storage through retention mechanism and increasing the efficiency and reliability of oil and gas extraction from these complicated subsurface formations.",10.1007/s13202-020-01052-7,2021.0

We evaluate the three major technologies that are utilised for carbon capture: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel combustion. We review the advances in carbon capture, storage and utilisation. We compare carbon uptake technologies with techniques of carbon dioxide separation. Monoethanolamine is the most common carbon sorbent; yet it requires a high regeneration energy of 3.5 GJ per tonne of CO2. Alternatively, recent advances in sorbent technology reveal novel solvents such as a modulated amine blend with lower regeneration energy of 2.17 GJ per tonne of CO2. Graphene-type materials show CO2 adsorption capacity of 0.07 mol/g, which is 10 times higher than that of specific types of activated carbon, zeolites and metal-organic frameworks. CO2 geosequestration provides an efficient and long-term strategy for storing the captured CO2 in geological formations with a global storage capacity factor at a Gt-scale within operational timescales. Regarding the utilisation route, currently, the gross global utilisation of CO2 is lower than 200 million tonnes per year, which is roughly negligible compared with the extent of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which is higher than 32,000 million tonnes per year. Herein, we review different CO2 utilisation methods such as direct routes, i.e. beverage carbonation, food packaging and oil recovery, chemical industries and fuels. Moreover, we investigated additional CO2 utilisation for base-load power generation, seasonal energy storage, and district cooling and cryogenic direct air CO2 capture using geothermal energy. Through bibliometric mapping, we identified the research gap in the literature within this field which requires future investigations, for instance, designing new and stable ionic liquids, pore size and selectivity of metal-organic frameworks and enhancing the adsorption capacity of novel solvents. Moreover, areas such as techno-economic evaluation of novel solvents, process design and dynamic simulation require further effort as well as research and development before pilot- and commercial-scale trials.",10.1007/s10311-020-01133-3,2021.0

It is expected that it will continue to grow, as the world's population gets wealthier, social dynamics change and people demand more affordable and useful materials. The industry recognises that the Earth's carrying capacity is limited. It is adapting to seek to become a truly sustainable 'carbo'-chemical industry. This paper will address the three main challenges of this transition: shifting hydrocarbon stock, climate change and circular economy. As the energy sector transitions from oil, coal and eventually natural gas, it is expected that the chemical industry will have access to abundant hydrocarbon stocks for which it can find valuable uses. But rising CO2 prices and increasing upgrading costs will likely encourage greater use of alternative, low-carbon feedstocks. In particular, there may be a development of biomass for manufacturing oxygenated chemical intermediates and bio-based materials. To help tackle climate change, the industry will need to reduce the CO2 emissions of its processes and utilities (energy sources). Ways to achieve this will include efficiency improvements, electrification of utilities and processes and switching to renewable H-2; upgrading by-products to chemicals; and CO2 capture and storage or utilisation (CCS/CCU). The issue of plastic waste pollution is combining with the challenges discussed above to push society and governments towards a more circular economy. Customer demand for sustainable products is growing. New regulations (and technologies) are being rolled out for waste collection, sorting and recycling. In addition, the industry is making pledges to produce and use more sustainably. However, it is expected that fresh carbon will still have to enter the material cycle. It will be needed to feed the growth of the chemical industry and to compensate for inevitable recycling losses. For a truly circular industry, this fresh carbon would come from a renewable source, i.e. from atmospheric CO2, initially via biomass and later possibly from direct CO2 capture and utilisation (CCU).",10.1039/d1ee00532d,2021.0

To investigate the variation of gas adsorption patterns under the constraint of pressure and temperature, the applicability of the theories of monolayer adsorption, multilayer adsorption, and micropore filling was discussed. The preferential selection coefficient of CO2 for CH4 under different conditions was characterized by the absolute adsorption capacity (V-abs) ratio of CO2 to CH4 (aCO(2)/CH4). Moreover, the implication of the CO2 injection to enhance gas recovery and the CO2 capture and storage (EGR-CCS) process was analyzed. The results exhibit that the excess adsorption curves of CH4 are smooth, and the experimental temperature has no noticeable effect on the shape of curves. At the same time, a ""sharp peak"" is recorded in the excess adsorption curves of CO2 at low temperatures (30 and 55 degrees C) near the critical pressure, which is quite distinct from the smooth curves at high temperatures (80 and 100 degrees C). Correspondingly, there are two ""jump pressure"" values in the density curves (30 and 55 degrees C) of the adsorption system and the density curves are divided into three stages. The Dubinin-Astakhov and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) models show an optimum degree of fit for CH4 and CO2 adsorption curves under all experimental temperature and pressure conditions. The Langmuir model fits the adsorption curves of 80 and 100 degrees C better, while the BET model is appropriate for 30 and 55 degrees C. The adsorption affinity of CO2 is higher than CH4, with the value of alpha CO2/CH4 in the range of 2.47-12.16. The value of alpha CO2/CH4 increases with a rise in pressure but is inhibited by high temperatures, while the inhibition is negligible when the experimental temperature exceeds 80 degrees C. The adsorption preferential of CO2 is stronger in the shallow reservoir (alpha CO2/CH4 > 10.5), and the application prospect of the EGR process is promising. In contrast, the adsorption preferential is slightly weakened in the deep reservoir (alpha CO2/CH4 < 4.5), which can be considered for CO2 capture, utilization, and storage. Results from this investigation provide novel insights on the adsorption characteristics of CH4 and CO2 on the shale matrix at high pressure and temperature.

Carbon capture and storage technologies are the leading options, but lately the use of CO2 is also being considered as a very attractive alternative that approaches a circular economy. In this regard, power to gas is a promising option to take advantage of renewable H-2 by converting it, together with the captured CO2, into renewable gases, in particular renewable methane. As renewable energy production, or the mismatch between renewable production and consumption, is not constant, it is essential to store renewable H-2 or CO2 to properly run a methanation installation and produce renewable gas. This work analyses and optimizes the system layout and storage pressure and presents an annual cost (including CAPEX and OPEX) minimization. Results show the proper compression stages need to achieve the storage pressure that minimizes the system cost. This pressure is just below the supercritical pressure for CO2 and at lower pressures for H-2, around 67 bar. This last quantity is in agreement with the usual pressures to store and distribute natural gas. Moreover, the H-2 storage costs are higher than that of CO2, even with lower mass quantities; this is due to the lower H-2 density compared with CO2. Finally, it is concluded that the compressor costs are the most relevant costs for CO2 compression, but the storage tank costs are the most relevant in the case of H-2.",10.3390/app112210741,2021.0

On the other hand, non-aqueous fracturing techniques are green hydraulic fracturing methods that leave minimal impact on the formation and environment; and thus, could serve as a good alternative to water-based approaches. In this review, several waterless technologies for improving shale and ultra-tight rocks conductivity was studied. Some available simulation techniques for monitoring the performance of these techniques were also covered. Liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) fracking method has a high initial execution cost, although it present a potential in mitigating global warming was discussed. The general understanding of the inherent limitations associated with each methods is required, and therefore have been addressed for better decision making. While waterless fracturing is characterized by a rapid flow back period, Sc-CO2 has low sand carrying capacity because of its low viscosity. Similarly, cryogenic fracturing with liquid N2 for instance causes rapid cooling of the rock that changes the petrophysical and mechanical properties of the formation. For these reasons, future research focus should be geared towards comprehending how the cooling process involved in employing cryogenic fluids could induces micro-fractures and alter rock permeability. Furthermore, the means to improve the carrying capacity of Sc-CO2 with low-medium viscoelastic surfactants need to be studied, in addition to the impact of adsorption forces between fracturing fluid and the rock on proppant transport.

The realization of a carbon-neutral environment is the main focus of science and academic researchers of today. Several processes were employed to minimize carbon dioxide in the air, some of which include the utilization of non-fossil sources of energy like solar, nuclear, and biomass-based fuels. Consequently, these sources were reported to have a relatively high cost of production and maintenance. The applications of both homogeneous and heterogeneous processes in carbon capture and storage were investigated in recent years and the focus now is on the conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals and compounds. It was established that CO2 can undergo cycloaddition reaction with epoxides under the influence of special catalysts to give cyclic carbonates, which can be used as value-added chemicals at a different level of pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Among the various catalysts studied for this reaction, metal-organic frameworks are now on the frontline as a potential catalyst due to their special features and easy synthesis.

Towards the aim of climate recovery, the most broadly utilized CO2 reduction strategies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS); carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are reviewed herein. Of these methods, CCU shows the greatest potential by recycling captured CO2 and harnessing it as a resource to generate emissions-neutral or -negative value-added products (VAPs). Within CCU methodologies, biologically-mediated CCU (bio-CCU) by microalgae is a promising biotechnology to drastically reduce CO2 emissions. This review therefore details the mechanisms of photosynthesis to sequester CO2 and incorporate it into valuable biomolecules. Microalgal cells utilize CO2 as precursors of macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and pigments; all of which are discussed within the frame of industrial relevance and market value. The biofixation potential of microalgae is clearly demonstrated by the carbon content of the myriad VAPs they produce.

Here, a novel pathway is introduced, based on second-generation biofuels followed by carbon circulation in an indefinitely closed chain, effectively resulting in a sink. Instead of using an energy-intensive conventional CCS process, the application of an on-board solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) running on biofuels in an electric vehicle (FCEV) could result in negative emissions by capturing a concentrated stream of CO2, which is readily stored in a second tank. A CO2 recovery system at the fuel station then takes the CO2 from the tank to be transported to storage locations or to be used for local applications such as CO2-based concrete curing and synthesis of e-fuels. Incorporating CO2 utilization technologies into the FCEVs-SOFC system can close the carbon loop, achieving carbon neutrality through feeding the CO2 in a reverse-logistic to a methanol plant. The methanol produced is also used in SOFCs, leading to an infinite repetition of this carbon cycle till a saturation stage is reached. It is determined this pathway will reach typical Cradle-to-Grave negative emissions of 0.515 ton CO2 per vehicle, and total negative CO2 emission of 138 Mt for all passenger cars in the EU is potentially achievable.

The integrated models were applied to assess a range of technologies and policies for heating and transport where the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions target is met. Overall, annual primary energy use is projected to reduce by between 25% and 50% by 2050 compared to 2015, due to ambitious efficiency improvements within homes and vehicles. However, both annual and peak electricity demands in 2050 are more than double compared with 2015.

By contrast, German respondents are not affected by the variation of the nationality of emissions or the storage site. We connect this finding to construal level theory, arguing that Germans are more psychologically distanced from CCS than Norwegians due to differences in general familiarity with CCS and the political support for CCS; this makes them less sensitive to our experimental manipulation.

The techno-economic analysis shows levelized costs of hydrogen for the plasma pyrolysis between 2.55 (sic)/kg H-2 and 5.00 (sic)/kg H-2 under the current economic framework. Projections for future price developments reveal a significant reduction potential for the hydrogen production costs, which support the profitability of plasma pyrolysis under certain scenarios. In particular, water electrolysis as direct competitor with renewable electricity as energy supply shows a considerably higher specific energy consumption leading to economic advantages of plasma pyrolysis for cost-intensive energy sources and a high degree of utilization.

These scenarios are based (i) on carbon capture and storage (CCS), where conventional fossil jet fuel is produced, and the corresponding emissions are offset by capturing CO2, either via direct air capture (DAC-CCS route) or via point-source capture (PSC-CCS route), and permanently storing it underground, and (ii) on carbon capture and utilization (CCU), where synthetic jet fuel is produced by using CO2 as feedstock, which is either captured from air (DAC-CCU route) or from a point-source emitter (PSC-CCU route). All routes are feasible and have their advantages and shortcomings. To ensure net-zero CO2 emissions, the feedstock of the point-source emitter, both for CCS- and CCU-based routes, must be of biogenic nature. A quantitative assessment of these scenarios and of a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, where aviation emissions are subjected to a carbon tax, is performed based on jet fuel cost and carbon price projections until 2050. Cost reductions due to wide deployment and economy of scale of current low-maturity technologies are accounted for. Parametric and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the effects of uncertainty associated with the most relevant techno-economic quantities on the observed trends. Findings show that CCS-based scenarios consistently lead to lower jet fuel costs than CCU-based scenarios across the considered time scenarios and sensitivity analyses. This is mainly due to the fact that CCU-based routes result in an energy consumption more than 20 times higher than CCS-based routes, which also implies higher CO2 emissions when considering the carbon intensity of current electricity grids.

This accelerated release of CO2 acts as a major source for climatic change due to the greenhouse gas effect resulting in global warming and melting of polar ice caps, alteration in biogeochemical cycles, altered rainfall, ocean acidification, eutrophication of lakes, imbalance in the ecological communities and extinction of some species, effects on soil fertility, changes in the metabolism and at the molecular level. Reduce, reuse and recycle strategy can be applied to control elevated CO2 levels by preventing deforestation, using renewable energy as an alternative for fossil fuels and reusing the atmospheric CO2. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are the two technologies adapted to capture the atmospheric CO2, utilize it, and focus on permanent storage in the geological sites. Captured CO2 is used to produce many value added products such as polymers, biofuels, reactants etc. Plants and microorganisms act as a natural CO2 filter. Several biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are produced due to the biological carbon fixation process using photosynthesis. Six different photosynthetic pathways and some non-photosynthetic pathways to fix atmospheric CO2 have been reported in diverse species of plants and microbes such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae etc. Algae are the most potent microbe in CO2 utilization and biological carbon fixation compared to other microbes and used widely on a large industrial scale for biofuel production. Algal biofuel production using captured CO2 is the best productive method to recycle and reduce atmospheric CO2. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Amongst various carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, the utilization of solvent-based post-combustion capture (PCC), played a major role in the reduction of CO2 emissions. This paper illustrates the development of machine learning models to predict the outputs of the PCC unit. A fine tree, Matern Gaussian process regression (GPR), rational quadratic GPR, and squared exponential GPR models were developed and compared with a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model. An accuracy of up to 98% in predicting the process outputs was achieved. Furthermore, the models were utilized to determine the optimum operating conditions for the process using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm (SQP) and genetic algorithm (GA). The use of the machine learning models has proven to be very useful since the complete mechanistic model is too large, and its runtime is too long to allow for rigorous optimal solutions. The machine learning models and optimization problems were developed and solved using MATLAB. The data used in this work was obtained from simulating the process using gPROMS process builder. The inputs of the model were selected to be reboiler duty, condenser duty, reboiler pressure, flow rate, temperature, and the pressure of the flue gas. The models were able to accurately predict the outputs of the process which are the system energy requirements (SER), capture rate (CR), and the purity of condenser outlet stream (PU).

During the lab-scale catalytic testing under BFG conditions the catalyst demonstrated: 1) high water gas shift activity and stability; 2) minimal methanation at reduced steam to CO ratios; 3) high resistance towards H2S impurities present in the feed. The results of post-characterization of the discharged samples confirm the robustness of KATALCO 71-6 towards BFG process conditions: no over-reduction of the catalytically active Fe3O4 phase and no formation of a less active FeS phase.

The inclusion of silica nanoparticles (NPs) was found to majorly improve the gas absorption over the base fluids (water and 1000 ppm PAM), which is highly beneficial for carbon storage. Significantly, a higher NP wt% was found to be more conducive for higher gas absorption. The carbonated water was then used as a mobility control agent for flue gas storage inside a synthesized porous media which mimicked a depleted oil reservoir. The injection of gas solvated fluids was beneficial for higher oil recovery. Based on this study, it was established that gas solvated water significantly improved oil recovery and gas storage which was directly proportional to the amount of gas solvation.

The CO2 adsorption investigations were conducted via thermogravimetric analysis to estimate the uptake capacity of the prepared adsorbents. TGA studies suggest that the nanoporous adsorbent, run under 100 mol% CO2 at atmospheric pressure, has an equilibrium capacity of over 0.8 mmolCO(2)/g at 50 degrees C. The characterisation results are in good agreement with our CO2 adsorption data, demonstrating the nanoporous structure of our synthesised waste-derived zeolites.",10.1109/NANO51122.2021.9514342,2021.0

The support used is silica nanoparticles (SNPs), derived from a commonly available weed grass namely, Moonj (Saccharum munja L.). The amine functionality was anchored over the SNPs's surface to obtain amine-functionalized SNPs (AFSNPs) using one step process. The SNPs and AFSNPs were characterized with FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and BET to confirm the structural and textural properties. Subsequently, AFSNPs were suspended in a polymeric solution of 1000 ppm hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) forming an AFSNP-HPAM nano-fluid. The nano-fluid remained stable for over 21 days and no sign of sedimentation was observed. Increasing the AFSNPs's concentration in the nano-fluid increased the viscosity of the nano-fluid while increasing the amine loading over SNPs did not much affect the base viscosity. The nano-fluid showed improved CO2 absorption property for AFSNPs over SNPs. This improved CO2 absorption property can be attributed to the synergy between polymer and AFSNPs. The inclusion of the AFSNPs in the polymer matrix also enhanced thermal stability of polymer at high temperatures. Thus, the utilization of these AFSNPs is proposed in subsurface applications for effective carbon utilization and storage.",10.1080/10601325.2021.2013727,

However, life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that technology choices and the benefits of CCU applied to MSWI depend on the energy system in which the MSWI operates throughout its lifetime, and on the markets for the CCU products. Carbon capture reduces up to 50% of the energy recovery of MSWI. We assessed different energy system scenarios, ranging from fossil- to non-fossil based. Direct utilisation of the captured CO2 is beneficial only on a local basis when substituting fossil-based CO2 (-700 kg CO2-eq/tonne waste), with benefits similar to carbon capture and storage. Hydrogenation of CO2 with the purpose of producing feedstock chemicals or fuels such as methane, methanol, dimethyl ether (DME) and formic acid provides much higher benefits (-2000 kg CO2-eq/tonne waste), but only in non-fossil-based energy systems, due to the dramatically high consumption of electricity (more than 6000 kWh/tonne waste). Use as feedstock chemicals provides more benefits than use as fuels, and CCU solutions focusing on methanol and DME are the most promising technologies. Although built on scarce and early-development data, the analysis highlights current crucial issues, at both the technological and system levels, for the future introduction of CCU in MSWI.

Attention has been drawn toward utilization of nanosize-based oxygen carrier for bulk application. CLC is a novel technology for combustion of fossil fuels that avoids dilution of carbon dioxide (CO2) with flue gases. Performance of CLC system depends upon redox reactivity and stability of oxygen carrier particles at high operating temperature. Oxides of metals like nickel, iron, copper, and mixed metals have also been discussed. Tendency of discussed nano-OC to agglomerate and stability at high temperature can be addressed by the use of suitable inert support materials. Reactivity of oxygen carrier increases with decreasing particle sizes from micro- to nanosize. Recent developments in nanosized oxygen carriers can be exploited for application. The challenges associated with nanosize oxygen carriers are stabilization and agglomeration at temperature above 600 degrees C. Different techniques have been proposed and investigated to overcome challenges.

To utilize hydrogen energy, the complete environmental merits of its supply chain should be evaluated. To understand the expected environmental benefit under the uncertainty of hydrogen technology development, we conducted life-cycle inventory analysis and calculated CO2 emissions and their uncertainties attributed to the entire supply chain of hydrogen and NH3 power generation (co-firing and mono-firing) in Japan. Hydrogen was assumed to be produced from overseas renewable energy sources with LH2/MCH as the carrier, and NH3 from natural gas or renewable energy sources. The Japanese life-cycle inventory database was used to calculate emissions. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate emission uncertainty and mitigation factors using hydrogen energy. For LH2, CO2 emission uncertainty during hydrogen liquefaction can be reduced by using low-carbon fuel. For MCH, CO2 emissions were not significantly affected by power consumption of overseas processes; however, it can be reduced by implementing low-carbon fuel and waste-heat utilization during MCH dehydrogenation. Low-carbon NH3 production processes significantly affected power generation, whereas carbon capture and storage during NH3 production showed the greatest reduction in CO2 emission. In conclusion, reducing CO2 emissions during the production of hydrogen and NH3 is key to realize low-carbon hydrogen energy systems.",10.3390/en14216943,2021.0

Energy from fossil fuels combustion always generates carbon dioxide, leading to a considerable environmental concern with the values of CO2 produced in the world. The increase in emissions leads to a significant challenge in reducing the quantity of this gas in the atmosphere. Many research areas are involved solving this problem, such as process engineering, materials science, chemistry, waste management, and politics and public engagement.

Its emissions have been constantly increasing over the years due to anthropogenic activities. Therefore, efforts are being made to mitigate emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS). An alternative solution is to close the carbon cycle by utilizing the carbon in CO2 as a building block for chemicals synthesis in a CO2 recycling approach that is called carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Dual function materials (DFMs) are combinations of adsorbent and catalyst capable of both capturing CO2 and converting it to fuels and chemicals in the same reactor with the help of a coreactant. This innovative strategy has attracted attention in the past few years given its potential to lead to more efficient synthesis through the direct conversion of adsorbed CO2.

The Ministry for Mines and Steel Development asserts that the nation possesses total limestone deposits of around 2.3 trillion MT with 568 MMT standing as established reserves and 11 MMT used. Cement industries are largely responsible for releasing air pollutants and effluents into water bodies with apparent water quality deterioration over the years. Air pollution from lime and cement-producing plants is seen as a severe instigator of occupational health hazards and work-related life threats, negatively affecting crop yields, buildings, and persons residing in the vicinity of these industries.

Our results show that hydro access can accelerate decarbonization by decreasing optimal gas plant capacity and generation. At levels of very deep decarbonization, reservoir hydro reduces the need for Carbon Capture and Storage. Our modeling shows how hydro reservoirs accomplish this by serving as both a short- and long-term energy storage resource.

Capturing CO2 at such massive quantities would require resources and technologies that can operate cost-effectively at the multigigaton scale, which we currently lack. Moreover, CO2 capture is an expensive and highly energy intensive process complicated further by logistics and the diversity of the emission sources that vary by volume, composition, location, type, and industry or sector.

In this paper, we utilize a spatially explicit costing model to evaluate how regional biophysical factors and geography affect BECCS viability. We find that the cost of biomass provision and CO2 transport and storage are an average of $20/t-CO2 and $16/t-CO2 for aquatic and terrestrial BECCS, respectively. Assuming rapid technological development in the CO2 capture domain, this corresponds to 40-72% of land area in the conterminous United States exhibiting systems integration costs compatible with 2030 carbon prices (median $90/t-CO2). Results are strongly influenced by the cost of geologic sequestration, in particular storage quality (as driven by depth, permeability, etc.) and available capacity, rather than simply proximity to nearby CO2 sources. For this reason, the Southeast presents appealing BECCS readiness owing to high biomass productivity (several counties with yield >100 000 dry ton of biomass per year) interspersed with well-explored sinks with large sequestration potential and optimal reservoir quality with permeability >500 mD. We also find that geologic storage capacity is unlikely to be a major biophysical constraint, as sink utilization in most states would likely remain below 10% at the projected rates of BECCS deployment to achieve the 2 degrees C target and as low as 1% in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama.

In the underlying roadmap (Climate Action Plan 2050), natural gas is declared to be a bridge energy carrier into a carbon neutral era. But, since the roadmap only describes guiding principles and abstract transition paths, the concrete role of natural gas remains unclear. By analyzing 36 scenarios of eleven recent studies with respect to their GHG emissions, natural gas consumption, as well as their transition paths, we aim at understanding how decarbonization intensity and decarbonization strategies influence German future natural gas consumption. We find that as long as GHG reductions are less than 70% in comparison to 1990 levels natural gas consumption remains almost constant on average. However, German natural gas consumption in the scenarios varies by up to 500 TWh/a for identical GHG emission reductions. This divergence is driven by the decarbonization strategies applied. While some scenarios focus on switches from oil and coal to natural gas to mitigate GHG emissions, others favor a combination of energy efficiency and electrification of appliances currently running with natural gas. When GHG emission reductions are intensified, natural gas consumption declines considerably in almost all considered scenarios and the variances of projected natural gas consumptions narrow. In order to achieve those GHG emission levels, switches to natural gas are no longer sufficient. Hence, natural gas needs to be replaced. This is especially true when GHG emissions should be reduced by more than 80% compared to 1990 levels. Applied decarbonization strategies vary from extensive electrification of the end-use sectors, to a production of huge amounts of renewables (fuels and electricity), to an extensive utilization of synthetic fuels.

The formulated nanofluid was investigated for stability using dynamic light scattering (DLS) study and electrical conductivity. Additionally, the formulated nanofluid was also examined for thermal stability at high temperatures using an electrical conductivity study followed by rheological measurements at 30 and 90 degrees C. At a high temperature, the shear-thinning behavior of EG was found highly affected by shear rate; however, this deformation was controlled using TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, the role of surfactant was also investigated on dispersion stability, electrical conductivity followed by viscosity results, and it was found that the nanofluid is superior in presence of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as compared to nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 (TX-100). The inclusion of ionic surfactant provides a charged layer of micelles surrounding the core of a NP and it produced additional surface potential. Consequently, it increases the repulsive force between two adjacent NPs and renders a greater stability to nanofluid while nonionic surfactant allowed monomers to adsorb on the surface of NP via hydrophobic interaction and enhances the short-range interparticle repulsion, to stabilize nanofluid. This makes titania nanofluid suitable for widespread high-temperature applications where conventional nanofluids face limitations. Finally, the application of the synthesized titania nanofluids was explored for the capture and transport of CO2 where the inclusion of the anionic surfactant was found to increase the CO2 capturing ability of titania nanofluids by 140-220% (over the conventional nanofluid) while also showing superior retention at both investigated temperatures.

We develop a hydro-mechanical-chemical model coupling the response of capillary-confined phase behavior, multicomponent flow, reservoir deformation and reaction-controlled porosity evolution to explore the effect of nanopore confinement on enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage. The results reveal that confinement effects change both in chemical potential and isothermal compressibility of individual components and thus increases volume expansion for any given pressure drop. For constrained mixtures, the CO2 K-value (at fixed pressure) and the MMP(at fixed aperture) will shift to smaller than the bulk state. Moreover, capillary-confinement causes an increased production of heavier components when reservoir pressure is below MMP and a higher production of all components and a smaller reservoir inflation when reservoir pressure is higher than MMP where miscibility dominates. Meanwhile, capillary-confinement causes a slight increase in CO2 retention rate in the calculation for two cases of native oils with contrasting light oil fractions but in identical reservoirs. Thus any production strategy for a combined CO2 capture and storage (CCS) operation needs to be formulated in full consideration of the rock and fluid properties for each potential site.

The Prospects of CCS in the Netherlands in the 2020s,,"Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) has been recognized as an important means of mitigating global climate change, but apart from several pilots, it has not yet been successfully implemented on the large scale needed to live up to the expectations as a mitigation method. In Netherlands, the option of CCS has been the subject of debate for a long time, as three unsuccessful projects - two onshore in Barendrecht and the Northern regions, and one offshore near the Port of Rotterdam - demonstrate. Nevertheless, CCS has been accorded an important place in the current Dutch climate policies, being expected to contribute up to 7 Megaton of CO2 reduction. This is reflected in a fresh crop of CCS project plans. For the most, these plans have a long way to go from the drawing board to actual operations due to the technical, economic, legal and societal challenges ahead. In this article we review the status and possibilities of CCS in Netherlands based on an analysis of existing literature in the relevant disciplines. First, a brief overview of the technology options for carbon capture and storage or utilization is given. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the governmental support for CCS, given the vital role that fit-for-purpose legal frameworks and policy instruments will play in CCS deployment. Technical, legal and policy uncertainties translates into factors inhibiting CCS investment and so the paper then presents a CCS investment project to illustrate how such risks affect the business case for CCS. Finally, bearing in mind that societal acceptance has proved to be a major barrier for CCS, both in Netherlands and elsewhere, the conditions that enhance public acceptance of CCS are examined. Our work shows that while CCS is technically a straightforward proposition, its deployment has historically been hindered by the lack of a sound business case and a compelling and stable socio-technical narrative. The main argument in favor of CCS today is that it offers a transition pathway for rapidly and massively reducing CO2 emissions beyond what could be accomplished by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels in near future. The introduction of new financial instruments, increased government support and an improvement in social engagement appear to have enhanced the prospects of CCS in Netherlands, but we feel it is premature to assume that this time everything is different.",10.3389/fenrg.2021.644796,2021.0

This study used concentrated seawater to supply metal ions. In addition, the selected 5 wt % amine solution changed CO2 into aqueous CO2 to reduce the additional energy required to form the metal carbonate under moderate conditions. As a result, precipitates were formed because of the reaction of carbonate radicals with metal ions in the seawater. These precipitates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and they were found to mostly consist of CaCO3 and NaCl. Furthermore, it was verified that the conversion solution maintained its CO2-loading capacity even after the solids and liquid were filtered twice.

The main authors, countries, institutions and research areas that apply LCA of CCS/CCU technologies have been identified through analyzing performance indicators using science mapping software tools. Analyzes have revealed that, driven by climate change mitigation targets, a widespread application of the LCA has addressed different CCS/CCU technologies focused not only on fossil energy generation (electricity and fuels), but also upon renewable energy and industrial processes (mainly in the production of cement and chemicals such as methanol). Scientific gaps have also been identified with the aim of promoting and guiding new studies on the matter at hand.

However, the benefits linked to zero pollution at the usage stage can be overturned when considering the upstream processes linked to the raw materials and energy requirements. To better understand the global environmental implications of fuelling heavy transport with hydrogen, we quantified the environmental impacts over the full life cycle of hydrogen use in the context of the Planetary Boundaries (PBs). The scenarios assessed cover hydrogen from biomass gasification (with and without carbon capture and storage [CCS]) and electrolysis powered by wind, solar, bioenergy with CCS, nuclear, and grid electricity. Our results show that the current diesel-based-heavy transport sector is unsustainable due to the transgression of the climate change-related PBs (exceeding standalone by two times the global climate-change budget). Hydrogen-fuelled heavy transport would reduce the global pressure on the climate change-related PBs helping the transport sector to stay within the safe operating space (i.e., below one-third of the global ecological budget in all the scenarios analysed). However, the best scenarios in terms of climate change, which are biomass-based, would shift burdens to the biosphere integrity and nitrogen flow PBs.

In this study, we assessed environmental impacts of UGCC with and without CCS by the life cycle assessment method, and compared the results with those of surface integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) to gain better insight into tradeoffs of two coal gasification technologies and lighten the environmental burden by design optimizations. The results demonstrated that most mid-point impact values of UGCC power plants, which reflect pollution emissions and corresponding damage degree, were lower. Inversely, the global warming potential was 16.9% higher than those of IGCC power plants. Furthermore, UGCC power plants have superior end-point environmental benefits, which represent the damage of ecosystem quality, human health and resources. As demonstrated by the fact that the value of above three impact types were 23%, 15% and 4%, lower than those of IGCC power plants, respectively. In addition, the implement of CCS in two types of power plants decreased human health damage due to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in ecosystem quality damage and resource damage. The aggregated results show that UGCC with or without CCS has a more outstanding environmental performance with exception of global warming potential than IGCC with or without CCS. Enhancing UCG process control, improving syngas heating value and decreasing the energy in gasification agent preparation are effective methods to further reduce the GHG emissions. Approached in an improved way, UGCC-CCS stands to provide a low-carbon and self-contained solution for power production and energy provision.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127383,2021.0

Since the industrial revolution, the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased appreciably. This has been attributed to the utilization of fossil fuels for energy generation coupled with the clearing of forests and extensive manufacturing of some industrial products such as cement. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide has been widely linked to climate change and the Earth's temperature. A drastic approach is therefore needed in terms of policy formulation to address this global challenge. Carbon capture and storage are reliable tools that can be introduced to the industrial sector to address this issue. Therefore, this review presents a thorough investigation of the various technologies that can be harnessed to capture carbon dioxide. The cost associated with the capture, transport, and storage of the carbon dioxide is discussed. Socio-economic aspects of carbon capture and storage technologies are also presented in this review. Factors influencing public awareness of the technology and perceptions associated with carbon capture and storage should be a point for consideration in future research activities relating to this novel technology.

The enhanced anthropogenic activities worldwide result in a continuous increase in global warming potential, thereby raising a global concern. The constant rise in global warming potential forces the world to mitigate greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is considered as the primary contributor responsible for global warming and climatic changes. The global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere can eventually deteriorate the environment and endanger the ecosystem. Combating global warming is one of the main challenges in achieving sustainable development. Carbon capture and storage is a potential solution to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. There are three main methods for carbon capture and storage: post-combustion, precombustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. Among them, post-combustion is used in thermal power plants and industrial sectors, all of which contribute a significant amount of carbon dioxide. Different techniques such as physical and chemical absorption, physical and chemical adsorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic distillation used for carbon capture are thoroughly discussed and presented. Currently, there are various materials including absorbents, adsorbents, and membranes used in carbon dioxide capture. Still, there is a search for new and novel materials and processes for separating and capturing carbon dioxide.

The 45Q tax credit expansion creates a financial incentive of $50 for each tonne of CO2 placed in long-term storage, a significant increase from the $20 per tonne that was originally authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2008. Here, we estimate the net present value of industrial carbon capture and storage with the $50 per tonne credit and find that in some industrial systems, the costs of capturing, transporting, and storing one tonne of CO2 is less than $50. For systems in which the $50 tax credit is not cost effective, economies of scale associated with small emissions quantities are limiting, and a simple gaseous transportation solution which saves on CO2 compression costs improves economics in some cases.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been widely adopted to control greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of the two systems can further reduce CO2 emissions but cause elevated investment costs. As an effective tool to evaluate resource utilization efficiency and environmental impact, emergy analysis on coal and biomass based IGCC power generation systems with/without CCS is conducted in this paper. The coal based IGCC systems are simulated in Aspen plus to obtain the electricity generated under different CCS scales. For other systems, the data for emergy evaluation are from references. The sustainabilities under different CO2 tax values are compared. The factors impacting the sustainabilities are discussed. The results show that when CCS is not considered, all IGCC systems are superior to coal and biomass direct-fired systems in terms of sustainability. After CCS is integrated, the sustainability of biomass based IGCC system is still higher than that of biomass direct-fired systems, while coal based IGCC systems are less sustainable than coal direct-fired systems under low CO2 tax. The sustainabilities of Texaco-IGCC systems increase with CCS scales when CO2 tax is higher than 0.0220 $/kg, emphasizing CCS at a larger scale.

Since the recently established graphical targeting approach is both timeconsuming and cumbersome, the algebraic targeting approach developed in this work eliminates the iterative procedure and provides rigorous targets that overcome the limitations of the previous approach. The algebraic targeting approach is demonstrated with a literature case study. Results show that the integration of energy-producing NETs (EP-NETs) reduces energy generation from fossil-based sectors, which leads to CO2 removal. By contrast, despite the removal of CO2 load, the integration of energy consuming NETs (EC-NETs) demanded further utilisation of renewable energy sources as compensatory energy. Finally, CCS deployment aided in CO2 load removal, thus reducing the necessary integration of NETs during energy planning. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Achieving these reductions requires a substantial tightening of the regulations of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). This paper explores how the power sector would have to change in reaction to a tighter EU ETS target, and analyses the technological and economic implications. To cover the major ETS sectors, we combine a detailed power sector model with a marginal-abatement cost curve representation of industry emission abatement. We find that tightening the target would speed up the transformation by 3-17 years for different parts of the electricity system, with renewables contributing 74% of the electricity in 2030, EU-wide coal use almost completely phased-out by 2030 instead of 2045, and zero electricity generation emissions reached by 2040. Carbon prices within the EU ETS would more than triple to 129(sic)/tCO(2) in 2030, reducing cumulated power sector emissions from 2017 to 2057 by 54% compared to a scenario with the current target. This transformation would come at limited costs: total discounted power system costs would only increase by 5%. We test our findings against a number of sensitivities: an increased electricity demand, which might arise from sector coupling, increases deployment of wind and solar and prolongs gas usage. Not allowing transmission expansion beyond 2020 levels shifts investments from wind to PV, hydrogen and batteries, and increases total system costs by 3%. Finally, the unavailability of fossil carbon capture and storage (CCS) or further nuclear investments does not impact results. Unavailability of bioenergy-based CCS (BECCS) has a visible impact (18% increase) on cumulated power sector emissions, thus shifting more of the mitigation burden to the industry sector, but does not increase electricity prices or total system costs (<1% increase).",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116914,2021.0

2,True,5281444.0,WOS:000607498000006,Optimal liquified natural gas (LNG) cold energy utilization in an Allam cycle power plant with carbon capture and storage,,"Oxy-combustion power cycles are an alternative technology for electricity generation to facilitate carbon capture and storage (CCS). Among oxy-combustion power cycles, the Allam cycle is one of the most promising technologies for power generation in terms of both efficiency and economics. Besides, the Allam cycle can also achieve a near-zero emission target at a much lower cost compared to conventional fossil fuel power plants. On the other hand, the flue gas carbon capture process and the recycled flue gas compression process in the Allam cycle consume considerable work. If the compression work can be decreased, the energy efficiency of the system can be further improved, which can enhance the competitiveness over other power generation technologies. When the fuel of the power plant is Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) instead of conventional natural gas, the LNG cold energy can be utilized to reduce the compression work of the carbon capture process and recycled flue gas compression work in the Allam cycle. In this study, we investigated different ways to utilize the LNG cold energy for both a stand-alone power plant and a cogeneration system with power generation and LNG regasification. A superstructure incorporating many possible flowsheets is proposed in this study. A simulation-based optimization framework is adopted to optimize the superstructure. The results indicate that direct integration of LNG regasification and flue gas liquefaction performs well for the stand-alone power plant, while the organic Rankine cycle integration scheme is the best choice for the cogeneration system.",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113725,2021.0
